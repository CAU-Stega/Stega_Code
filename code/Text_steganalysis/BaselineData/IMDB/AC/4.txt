she 's supposed to be married but i do n't care for a character who
i saw the whole thing but was so annoyed that i
the film also features some interesting touches for the characters
audiences should n't have been able to see this film
a good cast of characters who could have really made this movie a different movie if a bit more
too bad they have n't made a few movies
the plot is interesting and the ending is a bit abrupt at times
of course all that has done is it really do n't take a backseat to what it 's been done to do
i had high hopes for this movie
interestingly you can see the ending and you 'll see what i mean
some good ideas to it make you feel like you 're not watching a tv commercial
but the best part of the movie is the performance by the always beautiful tara bates
vincenzo does a nice job of showing how to make a good movie and his acting is n't bad but it has it 's problems
the acting is superb but it 's not the case that makes this movie so terrible
but then again what do you get
the movie was also about as interesting as it could be
perhaps the best thing in the entire movie is the ending
at the end a bunch of people go to war
no it 's not that he 's in fact a good guy
all the way through the film i was really surprised
i thought it was a very good
2001 's new york city is an excellent film
she has a crush on him that he is willing to kill
he does not have much to do
let me say it 's not a bad movie though and i do n't remember
how many times do you have to have
let 's face it there is not any plot line that would explain why
this is n't a bad movie
the acting is very poor though all around are excellent
mitchell 's role is so flat in the movie that it becomes annoying and is completely wasted
sadly it is n't as long as it has a good premise
no wonder she 's a man who 's a woman and a woman is n't
the plot is that of an old man who has been in prison
watch if it were n't for the sheer lack of any
i have just watched this show on cable for sale
of course i have the most interesting of all the movies and the movie does not have that
it is a great movie that you get to know and love
what is the difference between this and the final scene
what i did not understand was the plot
definitely this is an example not to mention the
as you do n't know anything about this film you have to be at my peril with the movie
it is also a film and a good one
i did not find the movie interesting because it was made for all the money and the acting it was n't that bad
if i could rate this movie higher than i 'd 1 i would
it does n't take a whole lot to figure about it
sneakers is about the best of friends who have not seen this movie
there is a real difference between the two men that the film has perfected
well this is a very low budget film about three teenagers who get killed and tortured but
2 the acting is n't really bad but still there is a fair amount of fun in it
certainly a bit of a remake of the original the story of this film is based on the book by charles poe with which the title refers to the character
i think i really do n't know
whilst the movie does tend to have the benefit of being a really bad story that really is n't about
this is the only movie where i could sit
look and see as it is a complete waste of time
and the acting as a whole is the worse
persuaded him to go out to work with one of the killers in the first place the movie was a real hit and a lot of the other stuff
this was the worst movie i ever had sat through
i'm a huge fan of the original
i have to give this movie two stars because it 's
maintain a few problems in the first
i would recommend this to anyone who can watch the entire movie
finally that is what the director intended to be an egotistical film buff
the only good thing here is that it is
sure we have the usual bad guys and a bad guy but it really goes into
in the end the film is just plain boring
he was also pretty darn nice
the plot was weak but the acting was so cheesy
henri chopra 's score is great for a small amount of screen time
even if it were a little cheesy there 's a scene where the camera lingers on the floor and the final cut scene is shot
i think it will have to be the most beautiful
it 's a great film for a rainy night but it just ca n't be made today
it would have been better if the director and director were trying to make it more interesting to make a story with some
like so many different chapters of the film noir and especially the one i think i will always be looking at
in this movie a couple of the main characters have sex and it takes them out to the end
actually the scene where the boys are talking at one another and the camera shakes the camera and is constantly shaking the ground of the audience
his performance in this film is as usual as an actual pickle but not a good person
fortunately the script of the film has no real purpose in
i 've seen a few movies so i can say that there is a certain amount of action
the plot is quite simple but its not so great to
you ca n't even watch one movie
after the initial shootout on the other side of the spectrum the movie takes you on a journey to see how we deal with the
the director has n't done a thing for the film but i do recommend the film makers
the story line is a bit confusing
obviously the writers and producers are not trying to make something like this
im surprised how many people on this forum who rated this movie higher than 1 did i have to disagree
any movie of a good script would have made the viewer
better acting directing direction or special effects
this film is a true gem of
the plot was so stupid that you could n't care less for the characters
they had to leave and the police did n't seem to think it could get any worse
the story was a little disjointed but was still the whole point of
the acting in the whole film was so bad that it was hard to believe that the movie was filmed with such a cheap script to it
just do n't waste my time on it you can see it
but it 's still a very entertaining movie
it was made as another reviewer noted it was just the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
i am not a big fan of the series but i thought the first
the story is very basic with the characters
from the looks of a noname cast to their respective friends
meanwhile he goes to the city to retrieve and
it 's an interesting film and a great piece of work but i do think the director should have
she and her brother move in for a few days but
let your life be on your head
i thought the movie was a joke and i liked the movie
in this case the movie plays two characters who are different from life in the very first form of the movie
mother is the only man on the bus and his love
they are very much as good as the two characters
they 're on the other hand of a new generation who can not stop the wedding
but this movie is just a good movie
love of the original is a must
as a result this movie 's got a bad bad rap score to it
i was hoping the film would be a remake in a different vein but alas it would 've been more entertaining
this is a very good movie and has the best elements of
but the movie is very poor at least
while there are some interesting bits in the movie and there are some funny scenes this is the only time of the film
saloon noise was a great movie
an entertaining film that 's not only boring but a total waste of
i do n't know how they have the guts to be this proud of it
unique but undeniably enjoyable film that has been shown for years now
love and hate for the us but this is a good movie to watch
not to mention that the only good thing about this is a very good script
i just finished watching this pile of crap and could
it seems that the makers of this film had tried to make a sequel to
personally i have just viewed the film
this is not your typical hollywood fare but you will get to find something better in it
dante 's character has a certain fascination with his character who just is n't convincing enough but he 's also the only good thing he can do
it is a shame that such a classic movie could n't get released theatrically on dvd
mixup has to be the most boring movie that i all saw on the
before the devil returns home is a complete mess
for an example of how awful this movie
the story of a boy traveling through gunpoint to avenge
much of the film takes place in the desert in a remote
the movie starts on two levels and they start to take it as they are trying
next we learn that the real killer
it does have some of the elements of a horror film that is so funny i could n't stand the fact that the zombies were
but you will get a lot better
absolutely horrible movie that i 've seen so far
it was very enjoyable and the story
the film is about as much fun to sit through
and then he 's got his head on the ground
the only good moments were the fight on the back of an elevator and the
first the film is shot in a style of its own which has its fair share of
there were so many things wrong with watching films
this is a very moving show from start to finish
we all knew we had a lot of time to
suffice it to say that it would take a long time for the movie to get out from a wider audience
first let 's face it that makes an already good movie
the plot is n't all bad
the only thing it really was not scary about this piece of trash was that it did n't feature much
an excellent director of the play a film that should have ended in a good way as he had a lot more to offer
he is the first man in the movie and it is also very hard to figure out who
i do n't think that i could have done
kurosawa is a master of the macabre
to my surprise it does get a few of its credit
it is a film that makes me
the only reason it gets is because of the bad dubbing
you will never learn what happened or what is coming and why the people in the movie are so good
now if you 're a big fan of the genre then the first series is better to watch
some of his films have little to nothing about his life
the plot of the movie is really good and the acting is very impressive
roaming the streets and a couple of good actors all of whom
what is even worse is that he
i think it 's great for anyone 's eyes
if this is n't enough for kids who think they 're not really a cartoon you 'll enjoy
in the end they find it easy when the girl is kidnapped
his character is the villain 's sister or whatever it 's like to
still you have to think it is that bad the acting is pretty bad
some movies tend to be a comedy and a bit
zanuck 's film was a complete flop and this is only in the end where the film
beware of my time but the film is very good
i do n't know how much i liked the movie
but you know nothing about the film or what it is and it is
the first part of the film is an exciting one
i do n't know about you
instead of watching the film it has the same effect with the same exact same plot that is n't used
the acting is great particularly in the first act of his last film
they also had to do a decent job and the film also seemed to make up for what they were trying to get
director jacques audiard has created a very unique film a film filled with a strong cast and a unique story
the movie has an excellent story and the
my friend said that the movie did n't work for me
probably the best film i 've seen in a long long time
joan crawford and john cusack are great together and the movie never really hits any of the
a great deal of money to see
a lot of people have said here the plot is a little farfetched and the characters are just stupid
this movie really was a waste of good
sure i do n't care if it is a bad movie but i think this movie was great
he is not a great actor but a good guy and an excellent actor and a good actor
it is the funniest part in movie history
it was a really funny movie
in fact it 's an old film of a movie that is n't as good as i would have seen it
the actors in the first movie were good but they were good
never before was the fun that he did
the first half of the film focuses on the lives of a group of people and some of
no real character development could save this turkey
it 's not a terrible film as it is an overlong movie
it would seem that the film was made in the
ah a few moments but the story line is n't all that compelling and it works in a very interesting way
of course we 're supposed to feel like the story is about it and
a group of students get married
another highlight is when i went to the film theater to see the
not just because he likes his movies but in fact a bit in the past is just a
this movie is an exercise in bollywood 's golden age
now i have to go through the comments but i 'll just do
i have heard that this is a movie that i could n't believe it
not that this was a bad movie
uncle sam is very good in everything he did and that is why his
on the other hand if you 're thinking about renting it and have some mates who have
the acting is horrible the story is weak and i love the actors
yes the acting is horrible and the direction and the acting are
today a movie with great special effects and a nice plot line it is hard to believe that the movie 's
she 's not a good actress and she does not seem to care much about
and i have to add to the point why
the acting is so bad the script is bad and at times the plot
sad to see the director of this film
it 's an insult to this
aside from some interesting performances and the supporting cast this movie is really quite good
i love to say this movie sucks but it 's
i think this is a great film and it shows that the story is based on a true story
fortunately the two leading roles make him a star
i am not sure who they would think of this movie because it was so stupid to watch i was laughing in the
ok we have a movie that looks like it would be an homage to the original
when she finds a woman he is in a hospital with her husband in an attempt to escape her father 's mother
it could have been much better
also the fact that she does get
at the same time the main problem with these two films is that the director does
the only reason i watched it was because there were so many other films out there to make you laugh
sure but this movie is n't even that well known either
i love it because the show has a very nice premise and some great episodes
it was a complete waste of time
campbell 's character is an actor in some ways but not a great actor and it seems he has a bad taste
my husband is a movie student on the way to california in
i think that the film is a good movie but you
it was a shame and expected
unfortunately i could n't have made more sense
i had the privilege to see this and as a child on tv
the script is quite clever and the
it has the most amazing story line of my childhood and the best thing to come out of the country since childhood and its the best movie ever made to date
ivan is the best actor in the film
sue is n't a great woman but she still is n't as funny as i expected her
i 've had some friends who have never known that the
his brother was a man of sorts
kidnapping of the people he meets in an accident
analyze is the best film by the master of the director
i'm not a big fan of musicals and i really have n't seen
the story is pretty weak the acting is poor and the
this is one of those movies i have not even seen in my lifetime so this is the kind of movie that
however the director and director decided to show
do n't get me wrong i never really liked anything
i thought this movie was a bit too slow and too slow but that 's all i could say it has a lot going
channel 3 was a terrible move but the ending
let 's put it simply because it was directed by peter ustinov who i thought
maybe because of the fact that he was
as a fan of the original japanese television show there 's very little to this series
some of the best in the world and a lot of fun
it seemed to me like a bunch of people had to have an hour
i 've always enjoyed this show for some reason and then
oh my god and i just wanted to kill everyone who wrote this movie
since then they 're all good
the plot of the movie is the same as the first two films
yes i do n't get the chance to see this film but if it is on the video or dvd i would purchase it
it 's a lot of fun to watch
and i ca n't tell how much the film makers of
also the fact that the film was made as much as a horror flick is pretty obvious
the movie is so bad i just ca n't get it on a theater lol
okay i 've seen the same bad
hell i saw the movie the day it ended
its just too bad to have seen this crap
the whole movie is just another dull mess from the start of the movie
time for the future to occur
this is n't one of those movies
that 's about as much as you can get
the film is so bad that it makes the entire movie laughable and
the film is n't perfect in its own right and the actors are mostly all bad
he does n't even come close to it until one character gets the chance to use a few
of fact it is a shame
well there 's a lot of plot in this movie and i
now we see them both as a sort of act of the two
both of which have already been seen in film adaptations but the first one with the same title
therefore the rest of the cast including their fellow costars are n't very good as the two leads
the acting is good as far as i am concerned with it
it is a very good story
this film was a waste of time but it certainly is a film that should be banned on dvd
why on earth did the makers of this piece of trash have no
that 's why i loved it but i think the movie just did
is this the same kind of thing and it just happens
and then the two main characters are a bunch of friends and friends
the first time i saw it was to a friend who had the misfortune of watching the first one in the theater but still i thought it was funny
you know this is supposed to be a romantic comedy but it is so ridiculous
clearly she 's a victim who is a little too much and it is hard to imagine how she got a job
also the plot is just plain stupid
that said this movie is a complete
in fact the only thing you 'll see coming out of him is that he makes a difference in his
but what was wrong with the film at the time
there are two other movies in this that are made to date the most
furthermore this movie is not about the same people as the real life it is also rather a psychological study about the consequences that occur during
the plot is that you 're supposed to
legendary and talented actors like john wayne and john wayne are a wonderful combination of talent and skill
no one will notice this as the worst thing in the film
my friends and i were laughing at the camera and the audience and it 's a nice
the film is a complete disaster of the genre
the story of the film is as follows the lives of
add to the mix a new actor and it is an attempt at a new version of his
at first i thought it was a very good movie
this is one of those movies
as an avid reader he 's always been very good
let 's just start off by giving it the benefit the director deserves
parents of those who are looking for
it 's a movie and i wish that i had to watch it over and
the movie opens with a scene in which tom goes on a rampage in which
entertainment value was never really necessary to watch
far beyond that i have never seen an episode of a show where the jokes or gags are funny
when the film is done it 's a movie that everyone should see
plus i do n't know why people who think it is so
that 's the only thing that made me laugh out loud a
or if you have a taste of
it may also be hard to believe in an american
charlotte rampling as an actress who has no
we know what he has in this movie
obviously it was the fact that the film ran a few years prior to its initial release but also with many
she and his father 's girlfriend try to find out
the acting is excellent the script is flawless and the writing of the film was so good i had to fast forward
not in the same way he 's
basically this was the best of the bunch of the series and
joel mccrea also shows up in the scene when she does n't know where to go to the door
i think a lot of money was spent to pay for this movie
imaginative story line is the perfect example of what you 're looking for
we 're supposed to be a huge fan of the film industry so i do hope that i do n't want to see them as
it 's a story with plenty of laughs to keep the audience interested
in other words it is a comedy and an action scene for the rest stop there
from the opening scene where the camera is on the bed
the acting and acting is terrible although i
this is just a very cheap film with no redeeming part whatsoever
talk about how he 's going to go and save his wife from his wife
i am not sure why they should remake this
only one of the actors in the film would have been better suited to this movie 's success and not been so
of course you have no idea that something will happen to your head so there are no words and
but this is a bad film and in a very bad way
but it just does n't have any real problems
garbo who is also the first one in her career has an incredible performance
this is a great film for everyone who loved the book
out of ten i was a little surprised by the fact that the film was made
occasionally they did n't seem to have any reason to see a movie which is a waste of an hour
an old tv show made by a teenager
this movie could have been done in a different way
this was supposed to be one of
the movie does n't work and does n't get it adequately into a bit
the main focus here is that the film was about 3 hours long
in the meantime a man has n't seen the first
soldiers and civilians are sent into the prison to go through the
the story is that it is set up in a few scenes when in real
suddenly the movie is shot and it 's all about an insane man
as the final credits rolled i knew the movie was going to be a total dud
for those who have n't seen this movie i think that it would take to a new level
before i wrap up a film i do n't want to give it to me
if anything the movie is a waste of time
turner lundgren does a fantastic job with the cast
it 's very hard to understand who 's who are the guys at
i have seen several films of the same age but in the end i thought this one was a bad choice from that movie
basic premise and the script were very good
and the ending is the best ever
that 's why i gave this movie a
the movie begins to fall into a real slow mode where you
i was very impressed that they actually went
he does n't want to be his
ruggles has an affair with her boyfriend
the film is very funny in the extreme
a little more than a bit less than a waste of time but this film is not bad either
i ca n't imagine how people could like this movie and i would like to warn you it 's just a cheap horror picture
was the only good thing about the
grace and his friends are a dime for the
the movie is a mess for anyone who likes this sort
obviously she does n't need to make the story of a woman to be seen as a good actress
but what did i get when i heard this had been done at my local video store
the cast was good although i did enjoy the movie
this is the worst horror movie i
he plays an important role of his wife
needless to say they are very good
direct to video sequels and the original movie was a big disappointment
a very funny film that you will have to see
the characters were so bad it 's laughable
possibly the worst movie i 've ever seen
firode 's film was a great movie
it has been done in a very good manner and in several instances i think
one of her favorite scenes was when she was asked to take over her baby 's home
yes there 's some interesting scenes
before she 's the mother and is one of the most interesting things i 've seen in a movie in years
it 's a great combination of a good movie but not as good as the other two
i love the scene where the two main characters and it are
that 's why people should have known that it was a bad idea for an actress as she was trying to
reanimator 's character is a little bit crazy but it also makes him one of the most lovable people
the only good thing was the plot
i saw this movie on my first viewing
evil is a perfect movie for the whole family to watch and i highly recommend this movie for all you diehard fans of old school
the movie starts off pretty quickly and then disappears to the
i was n't sure enough to take this movie because it was so funny
heck it has the same kind of person that is the devil king 's pet dog and that 's the point you 'd like
i have seen it in a couple of years and it was a lot better and more fun to watch
this film is a masterpiece of epic proportions
now i 've seen the first one
as with the other movies in the world
the acting is terrible and the special effects are terrible
good to all my friends and i have my own copy of the film
oh and a couple of the actors in the movie have
if you have a choice to see a movie that 's funny and enjoyable
there are a lot of other films
at times he does n't have to face the situation at all and the whole
it really is a very poor movie
martin sheen 's character was one of the first major characters to come out with his character
to be fair the actors are n't really the only people who could act better
this film is the perfect example of why
though he is not a very bad guy in my opinion it is n't
the only reason i went see it was that it was on showtime
so he 's a pretty decent actress and does an ok job
fred willard is n't a total jerk and he seems to be a part of his gang to have a career
developed to give us a real sense of humor the film just is not very good
also the film is a great example of a movie
the film also has an underlying message to the story
i 've seen this film countless times
i'm not kidding it in my opinion that it would be more of a thriller
i have never seen such an amazing film and while there are no redeeming qualities
the story of two sisters is very good
then the guy gets killed by a gang of thugs with a
this is a good film for people who love it
if anyone is interested in this film i would like to say that it really is the scariest film ever
i think i should have a movie about a guy who just wanted to make a film about a real
although this film is not as polished as i would have liked it it 's still fun to look at and even the ending
off his work the only thing about the movie that i wanted to
the acting is poor and the story is so poor that i wonder how it would be a waste of time and
only the most ardent and the worst ones ever do
this is a very interesting movie for the whole family
he 's a great director who manages to create a movie for its
a lot of the movie 's plot is just plain stupid but there is no denying of this
costner was in an early silent movie and as usual he does
arthur 's mother a woman who is a lawyer in a nightclub
they are so good in their roles
i was hoping that the filmmakers would throw in that a lot
i 've heard the book and read some of the comments here saying there are a few flaws
when the guy is a girl they decide to be a good boy
claiming that it would be a good idea for someone who can do a good job but a bad person should make an argument for the writer and writer that this should be an insult to anyone who is in
the acting is ok too the story and
i 've never seen it so much on my hands
it is like they 've got to be a little more interesting to me that this show is
it 's also quite interesting if it were that bad
she was able to play the lead character in a film that was n't quite funny
its about one of their better enemies
the film 's title has an ancestor of a girl who is constantly murdered and is
if only a friend of mine has watched it and who said i would n't have
i was very impressed by this film
the ending is a complete downer
jason robards was one of the actors playing the guy who made this a really great and underrated
almost every time they made an appearance i laughed and then i laughed at
two girls of the town are murdered by a deranged psychopath who 's only on
it would have made it a nice one
and i think he has done better
but if they had all of them they had the
with the exception of the one that 's supposed to be the same the film is a good film
the acting is ok but the story is n't as bad as it could have been
i am not a huge fan of this movie but if
someone should stick up the film
heck this is a movie that has some redeeming
the only reason this show is so great is that it is a
i 've seen more than two movies
according to most of the movie 's comments this show stands out as a great comedy
if you are looking for a great movie and you need to watch every second of it you do n't see any of
i think the film has a nice enough appeal to the film 's atmosphere to give it an interesting edge
an excellent film from start to finish
many of the cast are fine including a good cast a solid direction
the acting was poor the plot was boring and stupid the acting was terrible and it was hard to believe that there was a scene
al pacino is in a league of films
all i can say is it was a waste of my time
her life has never been to her and her boyfriend will never leave the island
and the movie is a pretty decent experience
i just do n't see how people who can
not that the story is anything that was n't logical and could be developed into a film but the plot is not very original
as far as i can remember the music was very
in a way i did think that i could n't stop wondering how did the film
thus i do n't get the point it gets too
the story is very good and it 's really a good movie
marvin 's mother has also been married to a married man for a while
although not a classic film i have seen it twice
the only thing i can say about this is that it has the same kind of plot and character development
i think that the reason for this is the lack of a good story
the movie was made during the 80 's when a few of us were used to see the film and we laughed at it
the film has been edited on tv for one reason only because of the fact that it 's not even a horror classic
there is very little to criticize the movie except for the fact that they all
are we really supposed to laugh
it 's just that a movie with no real purpose to this movie
wonderful acting and some good stunts
my favorite scene in any film is the climax where a
so much for the acting and the direction and direction and the plot and
much of the action focuses upon the two brothers in the background who seem to be trying
it 's not a classic film that you ca n't get a chance to see it in the theater and
you 're in for one hell of a ride
but it 's not as though this is a movie designed as
down until the last twenty minutes and still irritates the viewer and
if you do n't mind this show is the same thing you 've already seen
but the rest of the film is so incredibly
music is the best and i think the music is
the story line is also a mess but the performances of the leads the movie 's charm and the performances are
recommended for all ages that should not be
the acting was very good and the plot was interesting
there 's also some nice scenery and some
meanwhile it 's not so much the focus
some people say that there are a few faults i found this
confessing the real world and of course this could be the best film in my book collection
the film does not work well
the only redeeming value is that it was made for about two quarters of the movie
the acting is superb from the leading actors and the story itself is great
by the end of the movie a bunch of teenagers take a bath on a deserted island and try to find their way home
overall the movie is well worth seeking out
matt has no trouble solving problems for any reason
a very good documentary and a fantastic film with superb acting
at the end the movie is about how it was done to a t it seemed like
margaret reid plays the young victoria and she is very good in the movie as it is an important role
the first scene is a masterpiece with a few chuckles in
most of the film is about the war as if he 's trying to convince his students the most important story of the american revolution
the director is not going to be a fan of this film
unfortunately he has an enormous amount of money and his own
all in all this is a very good thriller and a good
there is some of the best dialog in the movie that was not the least bit
the story was that of the main character and the movie seemed a little disjointed and it seemed so rushed
the main characters the film are also based on actual events
to me this was probably the worst of the two sequels
urich is the ultimate hero and she 's the perfect suspect for
tragedy is the only place in the movie
stash of the living action is one of the best movies i have seen
i did not find the movie funny and that 's how i felt when
those who love the first movie will see this movie for being a good action movie
it seems like it is just too hard to get out of your mind and you can find a good guy
in short i would n't have to go with the plot line to save it
i was looking for something to happen and this film did n't work as one
having a few friends that i have to watch on tv or a few of
while there has to be a bit of gore in the entire movie there 's nothing inherently interesting about the film
however that movie was a good idea and it was a little disappointing
the story has a certain consistency that is somewhat reminiscent of the previous film
the plot is ridiculous and predictable
yes it has plenty of action going for it but it 's pretty much all of
kevin kline is the perfect actor as the villain he has the best lines in the movie
gabriel 's character was so ridiculous that i felt the urge to leave him in order to get to the bottom of the story
i did n't even care about any of
water is a very interesting story about
writerdirector john woo 's debut feature length the postman and the dead end street
now the whole thing is set in a crumbling city in a small town and
complete bs the first thing i could of done was when a film was
this movie has its moments and i found myself cheering for some of
if you want to have a good time you will not get your eyes out you 'll miss the first movie and if you want to
i'm glad she did not give a good performance but that 's no more of a bad thing in my opinion
there are a few things that do n't work for me
it takes place at the north pole
the movie opens well with the introduction of the viewer at the very beginning
you 're not really a fan of this kind of thing
did n't they have the money to tell you the truth
disenfranchised and his son have all been caught up in a world war ii so they
the story was great and the characters and their relationships were
paddy considine and john cusack are the only one able to pull off the leads in this movie
if they had n't done a remake of it i 'd probably never have made it to dvd
i could have made a movie about my life and i had to go to
it has so many plot holes and so many subplots it becomes laughable
and the last part of the movie is about a
the whole idea for him is a complete lack of interest in his character and his performance is the same
and that the actors were so real
i thought the movie was a great work
she has n't been very convincing but her role for the film has never been so believable for her as she does here
but for a lot of reasons why ca n't be more so than the sequel as you have a few things
lastly i found that i thought this film was excellent
this is a good little comedy with a good twist but a few twists
to sum it up just watch the opening scene
todd is just a bad actor and there are no redeeming qualities in this flick which i would like to point the out of 10
spend the money on a dvd
if not that is what i got
marilyn 's character is a complex one with a very difficult and loving
the movie is a complete mess
this is a very bad bad movie
i have to assume that the director is trying to convey this to his audience
but you will know what to do because the movie is n't as good as you might have been able
they did n't even mention it
probably the most irritating film of the year
let me repeat it again this one is a masterpiece of a movie
in the end it just becomes very irritating with the exception of this man and her two
even with these actors that they are n't a good one
sadly that makes it a little tedious and boring
also some of the scenes are a bit
this is one of the worst movies i
tom wilkinson had a great deal of
but in the end he 's a great movie
richard crenna is one of the few actors that you could believe in him
although i'm a fan of the genre it 's definitely not worth commenting on the film 's success
he 's a pretty girl a woman so a bad guy
too bad she got paid for it
much like the characters in the movie we just ca n't
very little the story of the film
i really wanted to say this is a great movie
the acting is so bad they 're all good to watch
i would not be surprised if that was a good movie if not the story 's direction
in some of her other movies of this
the movie was not really very good
case is one movie that should n't take long to see
it has a few funny moments but i would
rejecting it 's own story is the most disturbing and graphic aspect of it to
the movie is filled with great performances by actors
so much for a young boy who likes a movie and that is the first of
lai plays a character he has the potential for an early 80 's early on to play football
the movie is pretty boring and is full of unnecessary twists and turns
on the way there and they are talking for a lot of them i do
so i can see the movie
the plot is n't the least bit funny the character designs are n't bad either
also i think the director who made the most memorable part
shameless but i liked it a bit
she 's also the only one who thinks that he is the
in the end we are not sure if the killer is
meant to be funny i was n't going to be able to see this movie
when the two men have the exact same fate they are forced to confront their relationship and the two remaining men who get caught up in the same circumstances
soderbergh 's performance in the film was so poor he was barely recognizable in any way
the movie is just an attempt to capitalize on the original book by the same name
as a fan of these movies i thought this was pretty good
cast and crew have a great deal of talent here
i think this is a really bad movie
but this is just too much of a sided
the cast is superb the script is perfect and the characters all feel as if they had real
the script is about as predictable and boring as it sounds
the movie begins to have a few good moments but it 's just so predictable
the first half hour is just awful
what i like this is the ending
the only way to make a film like this
on the other hand if you love kathy bates you will love this version
he is also a good man in the
the story has been told to many people and there are times
furthermore i have no idea and i was in this movie
long ago he meets the woman who is in the apartment of the local doctor
the movie is a mishmash of what should be a good idea to spend
if you 're a diehard fan of the genre this is one of those movies you will always remember
a lot of things i have n't heard in a while
she is a good actress in the same role as the main character
it was very funny in its own
i do n't know what to say about this because there is no doubt that
the only person who did n't die was that there were some other good parts
ivor novello is great in this film but his character is flat and the script is very dull and very predictable and does n't
they 're going to be at least a little bit interesting
the plot twists are so contrived and the characters in the story are pointless
i have no idea that he 's a very talented actor but i think
the film 's story is a bit complicated
for an early 90 's horror film
ernst brophy stars in this film
to me the most disappointing thing about the movie was the soundtrack
in fact i could n't even identify with her
give it a chance if you want to
but the best thing i can say is that i
his character seems to be a stereotype
the plot was not believable and so i
and then he has a chance of finding a killer
in fact the characters were very stupid and i
i think that the acting of both men is better than a film 's a drama
travelling through the film we get a movie to tell you and do not get that
blade runner is one of many things that should have been the onehour classic
so what was this film made in
her character was so bland to have
votes like i can think of this
in a nutshell i thought that this was the worst movie ever made and only one movie could have possibly been better
already he was not alone and this movie has the feel of a bad film and is not in the worst of the
christopher mcdonald had a good supporting role
some of the shots of the ship are so much better as to make a very interesting experience to be done in some way
it 's a very entertaining film and the acting is great
the plot is very simple and very predictable but the plot twists were very good and i liked this movie
i would like to see them die on the floor but
the movie makes the story all the more enjoyable to watch in any aspect
way to spend the rest of it but in this movie
we 've been done so many times since but this movie is so bad it 's almost
i love it the director who 's all about the character
woodward is as good to do today as in this movie
this film was a complete waste of film and not to mention the lack of talent in any of the actors
the whole thing is completely different and
it 's a great piece of acting
an interesting plot is told by the writer to keep the viewer going for some time
you 're in for a real treat
the film is very well acted the story of a young woman who is trying to survive
he was a very poor actor
of course there is a scene in the movie where the film is filmed with the lighting on the faces
charles laughton is a good actor but as he
i'm a big fan of the genre for this
guess i had to write a movie on the imdb that this was just a bad movie
the story of a young boy who lives in the small town of a small town of ember with his
menial spoiler the cast and crew are pretty good
i think the fact that i was a fan of the book and the movie just was n't
producers should have given us a lot to think about this film
but this is a very good movie but that is about it
if you have seen it you would definitely know why it did n't have an end
this is one of the very few of john waters 's works of cinema that makes
turkish film critic who has been trying to
this is an excellent performance in his career
i do n't see what the producer was thinking about
abigail 's acting skills are all wrong and there are many very nice ones as
meanwhile a group of friends try to get their hands on a group of thugs who
with it 's release in mind that the world was made to entertain us as it was
the only way he feels he is is is that it is very long
a woman who has a crush on the child 's sister 's husband
she 's also a woman with a chip
the film opens with a woman chatting to his son
most people would know if the movie should have been
and if you are looking for a movie that is as good as it
while the first half is pretty good overall it was n't bad enough to be a sequel to a sequel
lovecraft 's acting was excellent the direction was great
only the two lovers are in love with a man that is n't even close to
while the movie contains no redeeming qualities i have to admit that in some ways some of this has a good story
with this film 's a great deal of humor i 'll say that the
what the hell is that about
finding this guy is the most ridiculous and stupid movie i have ever seen
it is the sort that a real treat and i think it 's a very good movie for me
the story is a simple one and the director is the one who will be in a coma
duncan 's daughter is a bit too much with a nice girl for a man
the movie is also about the friendship between the three main actors
brad pitt plays the part as a
not only is that the best and most important part of the film it is also a very good film and i
ok if you 're expecting a horror film with a sense of humor you 'll love it
most of the scenes were filmed with the usual and annoying and sometimes pointless
lets see it and be prepared for it will be a
the only reason i gave this 1 a 2 is because it was
it has a very good story
the film 's director robert taylor was able to make me cry to tears so i had to watch the dvd as he was offered to the screen by
while most of the film takes place in the same location as the old godzilla series it 's not that much of a stretch and
i saw this movie and after hearing that they were talking about seeing
yes i have a problem with that
i was expecting an extra film but i have to say the story has many layers in the film which are very rare to get a
just as we are watching it and the acting is terrible i mean that makes
there 's a very interesting story in this film
it is a very good movie
i saw the movie as a child at that
also the characters and the actors who were involved are in the film as well as all of these actors
so what if it is that a woman that is so rich with her husband
first of all the film is just plain awful
it was like saying i was watching the same movie from a different movie
in fact it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
they did not really know it when they were so funny
this movie does n't have to be
but for a fan of the italian horror flick fan like me the movie should be required viewing
black hawk 2 is a disgrace to its
this was one of those movies for me
james cagney who plays the head honcho is always great in a role that is not too difficult to play
there 's nothing wrong with that as a
before the final scene in which the two women were murdered for the final showdown there were only 3 scenes
now i'm a fan of the genre and it 's a little more for me and my friend is not a little more than a couple of people
the movie starts very abruptly when it gets a bit more serious
judy dench plays a very sexy but vulnerable woman who is attracted to the younger
my favorite part of the movie when the girl and
the ending is a joke i wo n't say but the plot is really bad and
he had to go to a party for his brother but he
in this movie the movie is pretty well
the story is so boring that it can only be put together in an incredibly stupid way
one is just like watching him walking through some of the windows that are the
not only is this a good movie to be honest but it does n't need to have the same impact of it
the only thing i liked about this movie were the few good parts and all the acting
he has a knack to take care of his own problems and his ability to
in this one he is an actor who would never be in a film with no
i was not surprised that the director wanted to use a different type
sadly they are trying to save the last seduction by themselves
he is a complete idiot in that one as well but this is a good movie
is that his only true motive in this movie
as for that fact i have never seen any movie that i could think of as an action hero
if i could go out of my way to see it again the first time i had the chance to watch
is it supposed to be a comedy in that
but it has to be so bad that
i was expecting it to be a remake of my typical b movie but even
however it was n't the worst movie ever made to be honest
the movie 's main problem is that
the movie does n't try to be scary
unfortunately the film 's director and writers were all on the verge to make the story worthwhile
all three of the most important parts of the feature series are those in the final third of the show which also gives a
the film is n't so bad it 's good i do n't care if any of these
the acting by the three leads is excellent
the only saving grace is the acting by the entire cast
she does not seem believable enough to be considered
while it is not a comedy it 's simply an interesting movie
the film is not a drama and
predator is a very good film which does not really matter but is a very interesting and entertaining film
here is the plot the actors try to bring to life the fact that they do
the story is told in a short running time with a little bit too much exposition but not enough to give you anything
another thing i did not notice was that the film was a comedy
check out the other comment about this
bunnies and dolls are always fun especially jordana brewster and her
but for some of the characters in the movie i did n't expect a lot to
this is probably the worst movie i 've seen in years
it 's a lot of fun to see a great actress and actress of great actor
the movie makes sense at about three different levels that you would have had
it is a shame that the script was not developed to the story of this
and of course there are numerous scenes that seem to have just fallen in love
the acting is horrible the script is awful not even the special effects are terrible and this movie does
for all the fans of the series and for that matter i highly recommend that you
i do n't think any of the actors
i was surprised to see a movie depicting the life of war and the war and its consequences the way in which the film does not work
then he goes back and forth and it 's up to the actors to get a look for all that they are supposed
but this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
c'mon the whole movie is like watching the same train building in the same way
the movie was very much like in those days
hoskins and lombard were the stars of the movie and it 's
sure there were some very funny moments but the movie did
the film is very dark and claustrophobic and the director gives the film some genuine thrills to be found
in a world where we are presented a film which would be as good as i have seen all the way through this movie i will probably go
finally i saw this movie on the tube and found it quite enjoyable
despite some of his fans and the others that this movie should n't have i think that a lot of the jokes just seemed to be a little awkward
there is absolutely nothing else that i do not want to watch
but i did like the film too
we see it as a series of flashbacks as the first time and it shows that the movie is about three hours long a
but i still prefer it that it 's a great deal of fun
the film takes place in a big town of the city which was a little like a dream movie
zeffirelli has a unique eye for his role as a woman in a small colorado town who is determined to get to
not to mention the fact that the film was n't made
when we watched the movie i realized that the movie is just so damn bad that i could n't help it
it 's one of the more interesting entries made me a great fan and i was a fan of a good story line but did not have that option and the film was
that is probably why i gave the show a 9 star rating
after the opening night of watching this movie i will watch another movie like it and that 's not the best thing to say to anyone
her boyfriend did so in an attempt to make her own life out of him
nina is a very likable character who has always been an actress with the ability to pull herself to tears
since the first movie is really funny it is a complete loss of a movie
all in all this does n't make for a great film experience
just do n't miss it unless you 're a diehard collector
nurse betty was a good movie but not enough to warrant an award
so in my case the film was so poor it would have been better if
so they get caught up into the mix with the other kids and all around
as you get older and deeper in terms of the acting the film is not really all that great or is
the plot is a mess of a movie
well it would have been nice if that
i think this show had a lot to offer and was a
that is why i'm so interested in making it
her performance is so bad that she looks like her every ten minutes or more
this movie is a complete waste of
the story of two brothers of an old man who has a daughter and his daughter who live in a hotel in the mountains after a
he had some of them all the way through this film
guinness is a fine actor but is still a great comedian
the movie is an absolute masterpiece
while the actors were very bad with some very good actors i felt sorry for the actor who plays the guy who plays jakob
while i have a few problems with this movie i really think that the movie should n't be made in color
all three movies are so bad it 's good i mean
this could have been a decent little movie about time travel
i ca n't think of a better film that is so
while they 're on the run to hell they have a good time to go
the only other actor who seems to have been performing his acting performance was
he 's not one in the way and he makes an easy decision to find a woman
through it all flavia and her friends are all the same
the music is good and the music is perfect as the title suggests
i thought the story would be a decent
if the story has any real depth or meaning that of the original story it would still
anyway the movie is about a young man
it has the same amount of atmosphere
this film will not disappoint if we have not to watch it
there 's not much of a plot but it 's
the acting was excellent especially from the young actors who were very very real and are very convincing
can i believe that it would have been a
if you 've just read a few of the other reviewers here on this site i'm a sucker for this
discretion aside the story is n't entirely convincing as it is supposed to be
they have an eye in them
sea of evil is a very interesting and original film about the life of
the film is a masterpiece in a genre of action sequences as is the action
when the movie was released we saw the movie and it was retitled i was a bit shocked
maybe it 's worth noting that the movie
yes this film has nothing to do with a plot that 's about the same thing as the aforementioned one
beautiful and very touching and i think this will make you smile and
underestimated films that were n't made in the year 2002 are not a
what 's even more remarkable is the director
and it is n't really the scariest film of its kind it 's actually a pretty decent movie i guess
i did n't like the original version which made it somewhat different
a must for anyone who enjoys the movies
i'm going to give it a 10 because he 's
but the only good thing about this movie is the fact that this is a bad
what makes this such great fun film
however the film is quite good
he should definitely be a star if that was the case
the film was also a success to the point of making me squirm
reb 's father is a very good film with many different scenes
while a good idea is there is a very weak amount of humor here
the film was a complete waste of time and i
the film follows an unusual and sensitive relationship between two brothers of the same age
they also are just as stupid and nasty as the rest are not
in the film he does a very bad job of showing that there is a killer that will
it was a movie i was lucky enough to have heard of but it 's not a comedy i think
the first movie i saw was really a lot better
on one of the best parts of the film the camera pans off
good action flick that was well done and very believable
but i found that there 's a lot more wrong with it
the characters are so poorly written the characters are stupid
misunderstandings aside it 's pretty good though
another thing i noticed was that it was a little bit of a good thing
she has the most convincing acting job
note that there could be a story
nana patekar 's character who was very funny is the only character that can
there are so many reasons to recommend this film it 's not a horror movie
kristen hilliard plays mary a rich housewife who finds solace in this beautiful woman in a society where she can never become hers
angelopoulos 's film is a good movie
i think it was the first time he was making a movie that was not to
problem the way this movie is so bad is the fact it took such a long amount
i saw it a couple of years ago and was surprised when it came to this film i was n't expecting something much
indeed the plot is very simple and you are never really sure whether
it does n't take for granted the fact it is about
with a script that makes it more important to the plot the actors and dialogue are all over the place
it is a great film that should never have been released
all the people who made it out of the gutter were in their early forties
the plot line is a bit of a downer one with the characters
to see this film will make for an enjoyable movie
although she is the most likable person in the film it shows us that she is one of the greatest actresses that i have ever seen
the story is n't very clever the acting is horrible
it takes long to get a great deal of screen time and then there is the possibility that it is still the same story
this film was made in a country where a bunch of students are being tortured
he did not do that much in the way of character development and acting ability and
a good film about a very difficult subject of a woman who 's a teenager to get married and get her own way
having lived in a city of royston vasey and ours i felt that the movie could be
the story is about a married girl who comes home from her husband 's life and her family and
the actors were all excellent with some of the
it has to be the most expensive film
now they can be a little unfair
but the movie has its charms
it is n't even a bad movie
in my book it is a great film
so the movie ends the way it is made up for when the main character 's head and
the film was pretty dull but it could have been a lot better
eighteen years later the only other thing that is funny is the way it moves
there is the odd lack of a character development to make this one of the best performances you can get
i have always found it entertaining but never heard of the story in the first
seems that the film is going to turn
what we all know it is a movie
it 's a very interesting film about the holocaust and how people will have the power to change the
i was in a lot of bad cinema and decided to check this one out when it released in the theaters and
while this film 's title is based on a book of the book by john page it is one of those
so if you 're looking for some serious horror and horror films do it you 'll see a lot of it here
if you like mindless horror and horror movies like this and you enjoy the original then you will get bored to say this is a
this movie is so bad it is funny
you will feel your pain for the
most of the scenes do n't really flow and you ca n't help but notice them and
avoid this film unless someone is trying
maniacally filmed and edited together with lots of extras and camera angles it
i was n't impressed by this adaptation of a movie
that 's how the movie got to
why could n't these movies have this one
grateful i got this in the dark
in fact the main characters had a tendency to be in the character of a friend of a father of the family of the young man in the movie
but he does n't really care about any of the characters other than a few other people who seem a little too much like an
but the script is really really good
the plot is n't quite a snoozer but the story really
which brings me to the end of the film
the movie is based on the same basic play as the movie in which the author of the book has a very faithful knowledge of the world
i really do believe that this is a movie for you
the music is beautiful and the songs of the show are excellent
while she does not have much of an impression of her character the film is
jacob the ripper is the first movie he made with his name
that 's not all this movie is going to be
lucky enough for a few good action films of all time
this movie really shows how bad it
seventeen minutes worth of the film are shot at all you get to the
good luck but in a way this could have been great
but for me it just does n't happen
i was hoping this would be an attempt to
he 's a very fine man who is still alive
but it is the story of a father and son
that makes up for the good fun and good fun
it is a great film to see it is n't even about the love of god it 's so bad it
there is some good action scenes in this movie but for those of you who
the story does n't need to be told
because the film is about the power of war and the life of women
in this film the hero finds out that the boy is an infected murderer he 's trying to protect her
two of the characters are all great and the story itself is
in my opinion this is the best comedy series ever made
exploitation buffs are all so glad i did n't waste my time watching
i saw this movie when i was about 6 or 14 and i still ca n't
they also made some really interesting comments on a few people who have reviewed the movie a
as the film goes on we are introduced to the characters themselves
it 's not that i can say that the movie is good and i do n't
still it would be easy to watch with the lights off and
there are some good performances here but the rest
i could not help thinking that the film would be a little too much too short
while the story is not all the actors and locations the film is
but in reality the two were never released from prison and were treated in the same fashion
mostel was the only good aspect in the movie
so why ca n't you go to
as for the acting of the characters it was a great film to watch
it would be a little difficult to swallow a few of the
whilst i 've seen it numerous times before the original film was made by a bunch of people who were a bunch that were involved in the making of it
kramer vs kramer was a perfect match for john cena 's first movie
the movie is a real treat as far as i'm concerned that i will never
i have to say the lines and the music fit well
deniro is a genius as a young girl with no talent for his
this movie was a real treat
writer stephen minghella does a good job portraying the plight of a young man who is attracted to his own children as a father his father and son are
the script of this film is so bad i ca n't even
there are a couple of memorable moments but the movie is pretty boring
duke 's character is an unlikable and irritating woman
i have to disagree that there was only one thing that i liked about the movie i
it was an interesting experience for those who liked the movie
for the love of god please do n't
their chemistry with the main characters is really really bad but you can find something new
definitely the worst of the series
i'm a fan of the movie and i have seen many more
there 's a reason this movie would have made
its not the worst movie ever made but i 've seen it
i would recommend this film for anyone who has ever seen a film that has a lot of
i think this movie is one of those rare classics i have watched and it is not a big deal in that
even more as the final chapter of the game the characters are introduced at the very least one time they are introduced to each other the characters themselves
while this movie was not made on a shoestring budget budget production values it really is a great film
but i do recommend a film to a little more than it 's
there is nothing to recommend for a film to be so utterly awful
its a little dated to me and it may be the best movie ever
to sum this up is that the movie seems
in any case i think that the film does
it is not just a bad movie but
the only reason i was able to laugh through it was the ending
the movie has a lot of things to say about the
but that 's just it and you
it has some interesting points and some good laughs
there are also some very funny scenes but this is one of those
in this case it is a very nice movie to see
at first i did n't expect a lot from this movie but at least it was interesting
the story is very original and the actors involved are excellent
the acting is very stiff too
the acting in this film is great and i hope the director writer 's cut to get the best
elder sister is a beautiful love woman
in the end i just did n't care about the
we also get to see some great talent in their roles
and as a result he 's not going to
george clooney was one of the greatest actors of his generation and he was very convincing as well but he did not carry
yes it was the first time that i saw it i did have no idea what to expect
next thing i would say was that the film was a great movie
toomey is one of those people who really does n't want to see
ok so the film was a lot of people running the gamut of people 's clothes
not a bad movie but this certainly was n't even a comedy
note that the film is one of the most moving and informative dramas of the silent film genre
the story line is quite simple and the characters are well played with plenty of depth and dignity
in the end there is absolutely nothing to hold your interest
dustin hoffman plays the main character of the movie
we see how the story of a man in new orleans is able to cope with his own family and the consequences of the people
yet i was surprised at the positive reviews and
i have read the comments by this film on imdb and thought that the movie was good
part of the reason why i enjoyed the movie was because it was n't a good film
outside the world she does it with the devil and she looks like she 's being stalked by a bunch of people
i did think that the film was shot in the future as a
but the whole experience was in the end as the ending
in this film she is a good actress of her own in many
the cast of characters have been so much more convincing than the film in my first two days
way too short to mention it
this movie also has an unusual premise
top secret agents are always on hand as if they have a real problem
however there is a scene in which she sees the film and it is clearly a tribute to those who want to be challenged
this is just the most boring and stupid movie i have
after a long absence of dialogue in this film it 's clear that the
soon i realized i was watching a movie in
james brolin stars as john wayne a retired cop who is a man who is trying to make
beautiful and interesting but the movie really does not deliver the goods of the book
there is n't a bad message in this movie
days later he begins to go to the house
he is an amazing man and i wish
it 's a very well made and superbly directed film
it does not deserve to be
the music is good the scenery is beautiful
it seems that the filmmakers in this movie felt so bad that the producers forgot to include the characters
by the time i 've watched the movie i had a lot of
and it looks like it cost an academy award worthy for it
i was n't really expecting much
i was very pleased to see her in a film with her own performance in a movie that was made by her husband
jay chou is a fine actor too
the characters are so stupid that the movie just becomes boring but at
it also features some very good scenes but the dialogue never really becomes maudlin
but there are some great moments between the three brothers
not much else is left of this one either
and the fact that we are not sure which one is in fact is it 's
true it 's not just a movie for children
strange that she did n't appear in this role because she 's not the one who plays helen
he plays his usual cocky and shrill role but does n't seem like he might have the ability to do anything he could
it is a pity that the producers had to use the word necessary to keep things lively throughout the movie
as for the acting i ca n't say i was n't expecting citizen kane in the way that the movie was in this movie
that is how i was able to determine and watch
godfather ii is a masterpiece but it is still good fun to watch
and i thought the film was quite good at all
but it is so obvious that i ca n't say anymore but this movie is one of the worst of the bunch
recep is also the most sympathetic character that i 've heard in a long time
if you do n't like those things you will love this movie
after having searched for it for the first time i was expecting more
the only real thing i could do is is that it 's not
farscape is a wonderful movie that should appeal to fans of italian exploitation
the story has been told and the whole thing
now in the end it 's hard to imagine how that is what he 's thinking to have the movie is n't
a good idea but not enough to make a good horror flick
unfortunately it 's not as powerful as that in this movie
do n't expect a great story
i was looking forward to seeing another movie
5 the story is just so funny
two guys in a bar and a few minutes later on a day of events together to stop the world
melville did n't make an appearance
even if this show is to be canceled i do n't know
please i digress i 'll never be kissed by another movie that is
there are some funny moments the story goes nowhere
it seems that it did happen with the
people like the young guy that the older man and the son played like the black kid the bad guys and the bad guy
nothing can be said about this movie unless you are bored and i think
i could n't believe what the movie was about
that 's a minor complaint of that kind
i do n't mean to spoil it but what a fun
but that is where he becomes the most likable
lorenzo 's character was so funny and so well written
but what can you do in an american horror flick
i was so excited at a film that i was so moved by the ending
this movie was the last that i watched before me and had me laughing
and why did the writers just put this into
the script is a lot of fun too but the dialogue is
i do mean the characters of the movie like a character with the
the movie is about how it was done the right way
this film is not a total waste of time it 's
awhile of the film is the story of two sisters who
this is just a bad show
the plot in the book is the worst thing in the movie the execution of the story is pretty poor even
well the idea of an invisible man is a bad thing but the characters are
that is how we 're in the present day of that time
it seems that the actors in the movie should never have had a show like this anymore
the main reason why this movie was so awful is because it is a bad movie
his first film is an extremely funny and funny
changing and a little more and more importantly the characters are the same
most of the actors were pretty good for
i was n't even sure if that really
most of the time it 's really boring and there are n't many surprises about the film as it is in fact the plot is n't
no doubt he was a talented writer in that era
how many people were given a movie by someone who could
im not a fan of the show but there are many great performances by jamie walken
the movie starts out pretty well then it goes on the last minute and so it gets a little confusing but as for the story it could never end
do n't worry on this film
i have to say that the first movie was pretty weak for me
when it does he is an intelligent person and we are led to believe he is a hero
instead the show has been lost on the big screen
i 've never been a fan of a romantic comedy
he is still a good actress not a good actor but a good one
another thing that bothered me from being is that i never got to watch this film until my mum and i both
this is n't so bad that he is actually worse to watch it than to laugh out loud and then watch him prancing through the forest
ms and the stranger is a pretty good film and the acting is solid
this is the worst film i have ever seen
there 's nothing more thrilling than watching a movie that is n't supposed to
what 's the deal with the girl
it is the most disturbing film ever made
seeing this film is a delight to watch
john wayne is not only a small screen legend but a
operation on the orient express was a fun and
the acting and direction seemed like some of the acting is bad the story line is bad
i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good
i 've never ever seen such great acting
yet the film does n't really add much to
okay it was n't a great show and i
even the music itself does n't look remotely like the rest of the story
a lot of movies about real people who have no real life no one could do
elmer bernstein has a really good voice
trinity the heretic is another film that should appeal to everyone
then the movie starts off the same way
it is the fact that it is not the only film
there is a very young woman who was in a position where she 's been born with some sort of religious upbringing
i thought this was an interesting concept that the film would take place in a near future in the middle of nowhere
she has made a movie out of a few of the best movies
well i think i am going to say this movie has some really stupid moments
super mario 2 stars for his role in the
bambi and day have never been a big success
we 've seen it about 3 times or that we 've seen all of them and all
still do n't waste your time and money
his first wife lisa is not nearly as bad as
everyone has a bad time in your head
of course the whole thing is so ridiculous and pointless in its own disconnected way that you 'll never
crossfire is very much more a drama with a plot
not one of the best i 've ever seen
ok if you have n't seen this movie
not much of the same is over i was wrong
this film is one of many times that i am ashamed to say i love
all the women look in their way while the rest of the actors look like they did n't
at times it is hard to understand why there were so many people left out of the plot but
the story does n't do a great job of explaining this plot as you have no plot or characters to tell them but they 're in the middle and the characters are all over the place
and it shows a lot of the talent of the character and its
there were other times when it was made
after reading about his performance in a small film in this film this adaptation of the film was very faithful to a book that
the script does not really make sense nor does it have that many plot
the ending of the movie is completely unbelievable the first half hour
we are not supposed to be scared by this
tony shalhoub plays a character who lives in a small town town with his friends
small but still watchable and worth the ride
indeed they find out that the old man and a woman are all that a big one
what 's up with the ending
the director has created many fine characters of this genre that have never been released
instead of a great cast of characters in the film the audience has to be a bit more careful to see how it is in the
everything is not so much to blame the acting of the actors as they do with
this is an insult to the intelligence that the
i was looking for a little more insight into the plot to create a sense of the
honestly i 'd have to rate this film as 1 the acting is n't bad but the plot is n't too much of a problem in that it 's just that the film is not bad
there 's a scene at the beginning where an old woman in a restaurant with the guy in the room is strangled from her chair and
this could have been the worst movie in a string of years
the only thing the movie does that is are not that they were n't trying to be a horror film
and of course that is where it belongs
in the film they 're all a bunch of guys in their cabin with their lives of a man who has
but if that means the show 's plot is to
meanwhile we meet the main character 's brother who is so annoying in every aspect of his life that he seems to be having trouble with
that said there 's one thing in fact that is so bad it 's good its funny
why does it look like he is being stalked by the evil monster
anyway you 'll not miss the opportunity that i watched it to find out
don bluth who had previously established the film was made and shot at the same time
few things are going on and there are some pretty nice sequences
instead the movie starts off with a bunch of people trying to get together and then get involved in a
as far as the movie is concerned it 's a little hard to tell what happened when the characters come to life
stray by the devil as a kid and a werewolf of a good kind of man
the plot of the movie is n't that bad and the acting is good
that is what he wanted to tell
verne 's direction is also impressive
so i watched it and i thought that it was ok for kids
i'm not a fan of the original book and i liked the movie
what the heck is the use of the
maybe that should have been a bit of a
have this film been released theatrically on a
the movie was shot in the same building a very simple and
its a good show and a great show
the only thing that i found interesting was the constant flashes of the
but this movie is not that bad it has a lot of funny moments in it
although i am surprised that there 's one more character in this movie i did not like the characters
and there 's a lot of great action sequences here but none of the actors
the characters and situations are a bit weak
this film was made to entertain us as a serious
it 's like a film from the director 's chair
powell makes this movie an unforgettable movie and while there are moments where the movie has some kind of message there 's a bit
yet again the show is not only the last of the
with a lot going for it this is quite a good film
i'm sorry that i'm posting the book as it should but i
better luck than the next one
a few days after the first of the series 's success i have seen an excellent episode of 'the adventures of
to make matters worse the script and the music were also good
religious studies in the us are shown in a very accurate and
this movie was a waste of film
no matter how many times it is done or the acting the acting and the direction were pretty good
perhaps it is unfair seeing a man on his face in his
but as soon as you realize that you are a fan of your movies
i thought this might work for someone who is in an abusive state of depression and
1979 's first feature film was released in 1994
i ca n't recommend a movie that the director has made so many comments to this forum but i really do n't
i have to say that i enjoyed this film
the plot is about a bunch of people who are trying to get the money out of the system for their country
the film does n't have any major laughs or atmosphere
pet sematary is a sequel to the nightmare of the pink panther but it 's still not even remotely memorable
i do n't want to talk about this film because that
this film is a great deal of fun to laugh at
this is where this series is headed and when its characters
an excellent example of how hollywood has become
a lot of films are made available with english subtitles
the script and acting are very good
being that he is in this world you feel sorry for everyone in the film
no one has ever been able to make a movie about it at one time or another of those other films
the actors and actresses have the talent of a great movie
this movie is n't one to start to feel
his performance is n't bad but i was n't expecting anything good either
the acting is great and the cinematography
returning to the scene of benjamin 's death at
the script by john c robinson is excellent as in this
your own life is in my opinion more
i thought she was a great actress
i'm a fan of the original
bad enough to be bad but for a movie about an
the only reason this show went from being in the movie was because of the original cast
madeline carrol in this film is so much in her as a child actress
at one thing i did n't care when the end and i had been begging myself to see the movie since i
the main character was a good one
the film also features one of the most boring characters in the history of the universe
if i had n't seen a movie that would probably have had a much better cast i would have had some
the movie was very good but nothing really really funny
happened in the movie and was very good
his father and son are not as good or sympathetic
quite a bit of a surprise but not quite the same
i really think a lot of his movies were the ones that took him out of the gate and made it easy
she was so sexy and had her hair
drama the film itself is n't too bad but in the end a great
extra of the cast has an array of
as a result the film 's plot seems more like a bad film than a thriller on a stormy evening
emily 's performance as the killer 's mother is n't bad the script is so
the first was the story of the family and the two boys being chased by the same person and a young boy who is a struggling man
through most of the film they just seem to have something
it was great and i was glad we had not seen it in the us
also there are many instances of real emotion that i found particularly annoying
i have a fondness for this movie
yeah we are going to see it
and then the guy says wow
the script is a lot of fun and the actors are good
i do n't think that it will be on a tv in any way
well i could have done without that distinction i have this
the only redeeming feature i can say is that the main actors were pretty
the only one that really made me laugh was the fact that there was absolutely no payoff at the end and it was n't clear who made it a little
pam grier was one of the most memorable of any kind as i think
therefore the story does not really follow the story 's
i would be willing to accept my feelings to this movie i am not a fan of all the other films i have seen
naseeruddin shah has a very different direction and a lot of his style
it has to go down and down
i am not sure what happened in this film
flo is very good on his own but when she was in the film he could n't act
overall this movie is a complete waste of time
this is a classic and should be
it 's a fun movie not for everyone
an insult to the audience is the presence of the character of the father who is in
the first half of it is great it is very touching and i liked all of these characters too much
movie is made to entertain a bunch of children for generations
on top of that the story is predictable and predictable and the script is just plain awful
trey perkins gives an outstanding performance in the film
or if i had to watch it again i could n't
my favorite line is when it was shown on tv at the start of
strangely the story of this movie is a good one
one of his best and a bit of a stretch
well the idea of that idea was interesting the
i would say to everyone they could see it at the beginning and do n't know anything
it is a great show because it is very touching
finally we are introduced as not to be able to make
walken and matthau are terrific as in this one the most hilarious character is dr watson but his role is still very funny and he gets to sing that
it 's not that i do n't think a movie can be made
wing commander was n't a great movie at all but the acting was so good at
the ending is so bad that i just ca n't believe the amount of money that the
also a great cast that includes a cast of characters that will take a lot of time to play
the movie opens with a group of people who seem the next
but in the film i did find it difficult to empathise with the characters in this film
well it would be easy to see the parallels between the characters in the end to the end which is a mystery because the movie does n't have much to offer
i thought it was going to be a big joke
somebody else was n't really impressed by the acting ability of the actors
it was a good movie for a rainy night
they were the best ones in the film
there are a few twists and turns that really are n't worth it
in my opinion it makes the movie great
if you 're looking for some good action movie and you do not like the movie i 'd recommend you stay away
powell is excellent as the conflicted and treacherous lawyer and the supporting cast is
the movie 's premise is very simple but in a small town that is the ultimate problem of the
i do n't know exactly what it is but it really was n't a bad
the film has a definite message about
this is n't a movie for people who
highest praise i suppose there are a few laughs in this
initially the ending is the worst movie ever
it 's a shame this did not go
so you are not the one who gets involved as a whole
instead the actors were so much alike and there was
to sum it up this is a movie to make fun of on dvd
the characters are not believable and are
this film is not for those who know a
it 's so easy to make a movie that is so bad that you ca n't stop watching bad movies
it was the only movie that i watched i did n't like
if it sounds like they were on camera and a few camera crew could
a little over the top in its portrayal of the young man who is trying to get
thought i 'll be watching a sequel
and that said a pretty darn nice movie but it was the most
the film is not really a movie about a man who does n't seem to know any lessons about human emotions he merely kills everyone except that he is a hero at the
director robert altman 's direction is as bad as the acting of his father ralph richardson
yes this is not a film
another thing i did not see as was a scene in the movie where she and her boyfriend and a couple of
the movie 's ending is somewhat abrupt and leaves a little to be desired
last night i found the film pretty funny and i was looking forward to it
there were a lot of problems but it was not a
it was all about him and his son and his wife was really
james stewart is a young guy who has been on to leave a child 's life for
robert altman 's the thing to say he 's a talented actress and is one of the most memorable actors out there
instead it looks like a bad idea
it is n't worth it but it does deliver a solid amount of atmosphere
i love it when the movie 's
lisa is the most beautiful girl you will ever want to
expect some good action scenes to redeem themselves but then again there are
being a big fan of a series the movie and the story line are the funniest of all movies
despite its faults the film is a mess not that it 's the same thing
however in the end i felt the movie could have had the
grant is one of the most convincing characters in hollywood
john carpenter is one of the biggest directors of the late 60s and this ranks among the best in his career
it 's a shame that it did n't have an impact on the imdb or even the fact that the story was
did she know that the movie is not about a female
quebec is the one and only that of the last century
and the other reviewer said it was the worst
still this is not a big problem
i think the movie is worth watching as an adult for a few years and
the acting is awful the editing is amateurish and the editing is absolutely terrible
along the way we realize that all men have a great life and they must take their own life
yeah you can guess if you like to watch a really bad horror film it
well i have to give the director credit for trying to give us a movie which was a
who has n't had a clue to it
this is the kind of movie that
and as we were done watching the whole movie
i 've got to say that the story is so
and the film was shot in a tiny town of mirrors
when his mother dies his son begins to unravel his life and the family
so it may have been a success to see but i doubt you would want to get bored by watching
lead actress laura linney is the film 's best character
i really liked this movie as i do n't have the original and i will just go ahead and take my seat off my eyes and watch it every time
the script is not very original as far as i can tell and it 's all about the way the characters interact with each other as if the actors are
if you are an adult with a parent that loves you and loves them i recommend you watch this
throughout the movie i realized that i was not only going to get a lot of things
i have been searching for this since the days of the release of this film
when you are in the mood for something to make your jaw explode
i was so excited when i got to see this film
his character is in the least sympathetic of the story and has an interesting sense of adventure and love
i was surprised to find that the film had n't been so much of an allout cult
spoiler this is a film of two
michelle pfeiffer does a wonderful job as alice
i could n't believe the fact it was made
but as a result of this the story was so ridiculous
the ending of this movie made me angry
but there 's some nice action sequences involving a little bit of gore and a few decent lines and some nice
it would be easy to make such a movie as a documentary of the
finally the two leads are so much on the way to play the game as one dimensional comedy and
colonel 's father who works hard to take his place in a way
i ca n't even tell you what exactly what happened and why this movie gets so
perhaps a film with good intentions to be taken to the level of a horror
children do not want you too much
throughout this movie you 're reminded of that you were watching the movie on the tv
the story is about the rise of a woman who is pregnant as the woman from the other side becomes a bit more complicated
the main story about the boy 's daughter being a very good guy and the mother figure out to the guy who killed
if you do n't see how they would be in the theater you 'll have to wait till they die
williams' role was a big hit for me
first of all i'm a big fan of horror films
this is the only reason why the show had only started from
it was a lot worse than that the film is so terrible that it 's almost
i thought i 'd seen this film with my friends
alec baldwin 's portrayal of the hero is n't too good
this movie is n't really a sequel and not the one which is n't so bad it 's good but i do n't
my recommendation to anyone who likes a good film about an alcoholic woman with a heart
despite the poor acting and direction of this film there 's no reason for seeing
she has n't done a good movie yet
do not watch this movie if you value
indeed for some people it is the first movie that i have ever liked in my entire life
the only thing i found intriguing was that the ending was a little weak
a good family movie that i have seen for a long time
tragically i would recommend seeing this movie
winter is a great film to watch
while there 's another scene where the two protagonists find each others the plot becomes very weak for the most part
there is no reason you 'd want to go through any of them
the plot does not work for itself
it seems that all the characters all are killed and the
it has to go on and on and you know you are there is nothing else you have
had it been released a year ago i would have known if this was a real movie
set in a hospital with some kind of a large budget it has some great performances and the direction is very good although not a very good one
but that 's the end of the world
hope lange is n't always in the film but she is not at her best
it 's a good mystery but it makes an impression to it
2 it was made in 1969 in the early 1930 's when the new world of britain was still
nevertheless there are so many other things wrong with this movie
brynner as an ex man who has no qualms about
take it for what it is worth
amusing for sure i thought this was supposed to be one of my favorites but i would have liked to see more of the character development
so if you 're looking for an intelligent and original story line about
unlike the original is the story of two young men at the time
what a waste of 2 hours
the acting is poor and you are
it 's the sort of thing you do n't like as you 've never been
the whole idea of this film is that it has a bunch of good actors but the acting is
it 's not a bad movie but some nice shots and a few
it 's not that i think that is too bad i did
the story is simple a bunch of friends find themselves stranded in a lake
eventually enough of what the film offers is a story about how the human race can overcome the odds for the world and it 's just the same
i would n't bother watching it
this film is a perfect example of what a truly beautiful young woman truly is and how she does what she could possibly do on screen in a small
did you realize he 's the best
i was impressed but i was disappointed
the music is quite nice particularly the song score
no more than one of the great performances of our heroes
the first half of the film consists of two characters
even though the characters were n't so stupid the movie did n't take itself seriously
this was the worst horror movie i 've ever seen
there was no story in it the characters were just
this is a film about people who can only be the basis of human life
so much of the film is just an excuse to be an interesting film
it is the fact that there is some
these men are the same as the ones who are the best to say
this is one of my favourite films i
her acting is good but you really feel as she is in the end
this is a really bad film
here the viewer is left wondering if that is
for this to take on film the real world would be the wondrous and most controversial
i have never heard of it but i do know a story about the
eight years ago i had to watch the movie to get a lot of praise
a man in a hospital and a car mechanic 's a baseball bat can play basketball
so many viewers have commented on the lack of
it 's a pity it 's not so well done
this movie is not even about the best
karloff has been given a bad performance as he should be proud
the movie starts out very well the actors try to get the actors the locations are good
things like this are n't very good either but that aside the film is a waste of talent
i'm going to have the feeling that this is
her performance in this picture was n't as good as i remember
overall if your idea of a good time is
it 's almost impossible to watch any
now the film 's biggest success is that there were some liberties to have been made
a movie like it is about to be on the air of reality and you can feel about its plight but it is not
the acting is ok and the actors are good
lowe 's character is also one big joke in his movies which was also his
having been a fan of jane 's work for me this is the worst film i have ever seen it is simply horrible
the whole premise of how to make a movie and how to
the acting is horrible the effects are bad the script is dreadful and it 's all about the action
as a matter of fact the filmmakers try to explain
chapa 's a great film for the time and time again
i saw the poster and saw this movie at the amsterdam film festival
too bad that a movie like this should ever be put into it
a few of her scenes were cut down in some of the scenes between the two leading men and a couple of scenes from
definitely worth mentioning but that 's just one thing that i have no idea is that the film 's
when you know the characters you 've never seen them in the movie
but if you do n't like the first two episodes
the story is n't all that bad it just does n't make sense
his father in the past is a pretty good movie with some
a must for any fan of bmovies or horror fan
the plot of the film which involves a very interesting idea of a girl and her son 's relationship is beyond ridiculous
i ca n't believe i spent an hour
he was the kind of woman i wanted to see and it was his first film
its a pity that a movie such as this is the one to get a
the first time i saw it the first time around
in fact there was more chemistry between him and the guy
now this show had to rely on the actors to get the best acting and best actors and it was n't the
the story line was very promising and the plot was very creative
years later his wife dies in the city and is invited to prison to spend the night with his
i 've seen thousands of other tv shows and have a
i ca n't remember the last time i watched it
for anyone who has been in love with an american culture for the past twenty minutes or so this
originally a movie with an allstar cast but
this movie is a complete bore
for an action movie there 's not much plot or tension or excitement in this film it is n't even funny
even though you 're a bit in the same mood and the first it 's the best
soon you get your drift in the end for one of these films
bootleg footage and the original footage are the same
that is why this film is so funny
this movie does not have any other plot twists just not a good one
the movie itself is not only a comedy but for most parts in which the character has
in a way this is all about the effects of the women 's clothing
no wonder it is an awful film
see it in theaters as a child
when the girl is kidnapped and killed she does n't care whether she can get away
i ca n't believe the director got into a good actor
settled down the river for one night a friend on the verge of killing the girls
this is the one in the world of the golden age of the silent era
is it a comedy or is it a spoof of an episode of an old twilight zone episode
as soon as he arrives there is no longer a hero that he is forced to
kinda the story is not as bad as it could possibly be
a lot of things do not seem like any
nothing about this movie is interesting at all
remember it 's a good film and there was absolutely no chemistry between the main character and the movie
there are plenty of great films but i feel like i was n't expecting the same to be one of my favorites
but in the end it 's a really nice movie
i ca n't really believe that this is a movie
disparaging as the movie progresses to make up for it
the plot is just too weak for its own good
when the film is over you 're left with an interesting feeling of being what you get in life
is the only way to keep watching
there 's not enough violence in the way of gore
check out it is a movie that will appeal to you
the film is a good one
i am sorry to say that but it was great
this movie is a real must see
so if your looking for something that does n't make sense
the movie is n't funny but the fact that it 's based on real events makes us laugh hysterically
like many other commentators mentioned here in imdb user that 's not saying much but i disagree that this is one of the worst movies on tv and as a
i have to say that this was a waste of talent
it 's a very bad film
back to the movie the acting is great
nice to read the book and you know it
the story is based on a novel by writer daniel harris based on
apology to mr wilson for this film
it 's all about the story the acting and the plot
it 's the sort of film which is very rare to get out of the vcr when we 've just seen it before
i'm a massive and big fan of the original series and i am sure that many
but the film 's ending was so disappointing
some of the characters were okay but they were n't very scary
the film is a perfect mix of action and adventure
as an alternative it would still be nice to see the real lombard and the gorgeous barbara stanwyck
now you can watch the worst part
i was able to locate the movie as i did n't have much to do
it does have a lot to recommend it and i loved the fact
while i did like the first film the
the script is terrible and the script is a mess for people who think the audience knows something about how to handle a movie and how bad it is
even though it 's not that i can accept what i did it seemed to me to be just another teen slasher flick
how did he get to see her a bit more than that
to me it is a little disconcerting
even the actors can only save a few seconds
even if you 're trying to get to the bottom of this story and you can relate to what the director
you 'll have your heart pounding and heart wrenching when
i just want to go through my collection of movies
the film is very well made but it 's not even worth mentioning if you 're
this film is a waste of celluloid and time and place i can only wish people
michael caine is a great actor for a number
madonna is the queen and the rest of her friends
i do n't really think it was intended to be that good in the first place
men should see the movies and the other ones with them
think of one of the worst films ever made the
despite the fact that it 's just one of those who has been looking for the most memorable and
but the movie itself does n't have
the story is very simple and has many good lines
dick the main character is also annoying
naturally this is a movie for all people that
i saw a film that was n't really about the evils of the
of course the fact that it 's a very popular movie
it 's a shame they even paid the
indeed it 's a little unsatisfying for a film to be released theatrically
being from the south african area and it was the director 's choice to give it some credit
we have to get out of a movie about a killer who 's got everything he has to feed and he does n't know who he is
some movies have been done better than this
when he meets one of his best friends and has her hair cut in to a new life she starts to realize that she loves him and
now i'm glad to have seen some better episodes
in the end it is more a psychological thriller that will make you laugh like a kid and a woman and then a boy
the movie has the most disgusting ending i have ever seen
maybe she was trying to get the wrong idea but in the end the movie really did suck
surrounding the whole experience the story is n't a comedy it 's about a couple of characters who are trapped at a mansion
holden 's character seemed completely different from his usual role of inspector who
i was looking forward to this movie because
shows that this is a comedy in all respects as a comedy
kevin kilner is a great comedian with a very unusual
after all that there is a bit of nudity and sexual rape which would n't help that you 'd have the
the only thing missing are those actors and the script has an intriguing premise
it 's a shame that the show is more about the show
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha a bank robber with a hand
the director should be ashamed of himself
the ending was one of the biggest things this movie could have in it
while some may disagree that some are just not as strong as what is now a film it 's a movie which is n't funny and
even the best scene is one of my favorite moments
second the story of the movie and it deals with the consequences
a great piece of work was wasted in this garbage
it is a simple story of two characters who come together and try to escape themselves from
from this point on we find out that the young boy has been taken from the city because she is not a very attractive girl
the main character is played and abetted by the same man in the film and he has the charisma to
probably the best of the lot of bad movies
this is a real treat to watch and it is very funny
la pena is a wonderful actor in
our protagonist and his cohorts try to make a point about this and that the only one really knows that the
i was really surprised to hear this that i was so frustrated i got my vote
i thought that this was one of the best and probably the worst movies i 've seen in my entire life
the film also features some great scenes which include an unforgettable scene where the father of the woman played by patricia
one example is when the young girl gets her boyfriend to take
sean connery is perfect as he has done well in his movies and is also the best in the movie
at the very least they could n't have taken this movie seriously
yet the plot is simple enough and the acting by all is fine and i think the director 's intentions are the most important aspect of this
even the movie is a bit too short
the movie is quite good with some excellent actors and a nice script
and then why oh why did i bother commenting it from the book
he has the right sense of humor
i would n't say that if the movie
that the film has the best intentions i have had to deal with it
but the film is also an engaging and entertaining little
the characters are not funny and there 's nothing inherently funny about this film
all the way through the film i was bored for some strange reason
that said there 's an underlying message
at the beginning of the day she meets a girl from her apartment and goes to her apartment where her mother has been locked out of
the plot is a mixture of two and the action in between and the ending is really bad
i have always been a fan of the show
the story is simple the characters are so bad
but the film has to be a little weak
hilarious as an afterthought but this film
most notably the film is a real bore but it 's also one of the
another thing that annoyed me is why a few other films have such an excellent rating
double jeopardy in this version of jane austen 's original novel the shining
quite frankly i feel sorry for the filmmakers and producers
most certainly not a horror movie
gertrude is a very attractive young girl and is a very strong woman
i do not want to be a filmmaker who 's a bit of a jerk i ca n't really do any more with this film
i really did not care about the main characters at all when they were not a single person and the actors were just not believable
so in the meantime there 's more to the movie than just another movie in
then in the end of the movie we 're forced to believe they
the film 's message is that it 's a little too long in the beginning of the film
it is not about people in the movie it 's about life and how they go
uninvited to a point where it 's a bit too long but it does n't quite qualify for all the good reasons that it is a good movie
now i know that is n't the case but
support is the story of two brothers
while i enjoyed the movie that it was based on a true story
but the script is so poorly done that it does n't even work to deliver the goods at
the actors are good and the script is so very good
then there will be another thing in
aside from a few things i did know that there were n't any scenes that were filmed and i liked
dermot mulroney plays a somewhat neurotic and likable character
an excellent movie with great acting and a strong cast
you do have a lot of things to say
there is also a few scenes where a lot of the movie is filmed by the camera which is obviously the only thing that impressed me
the only real problem is that he gets to the
i really do feel i wasted precious hours with this one
the film is filled with stereotypes of the actors who are not funny to watch and are just annoying
wastes the hour and a half of your life
in the end he is able to get a grip on the man 's soul that he will never learn his father
while the movie has many scenes a lot of it is filmed in a style like in the book of ingmar bergman it
i ca n't understand the reason why these people seem to like this film the way it was made and that
seems as much like a documentary of the world as a story it
some things go wrong wrong in the story and they are just stupid and predictable
i would rate this film a 10 if for a few hours if i had a
in the end of the movie she gets a job on the head
number one and 2 seasons from season 1 episode 8 the second season of 24 episodes of the tv series of that season
jack lemmon is perfect as a young woman in an early age
pay attention to a plot summary that is so predictable as to be laughable to all fans of the book and the movie makers
there is a scene where the killer says his name is a stripper
his character is played by robert walker who plays john keating the woman who has a onenight for christmas
no one knows how to tell a story
definitely a mustsee for fans of westerns
however i do have to say that the plot was rather slow but still
it 's also the kind of show that everyone is afraid of and you will need a better laugh on what this movie is trying to do
the acting in the cast is superb
the film is a real treat and one can hope it 's a
jack is still an interesting film but i still
i was expecting this film to be a good comedy but it got a 2
angela lansbury has a thankless role in her first role as a nun who 's the victim of the show
finally in fact that 's the whole story
however there 's a lot of sex and sex in the movie
i'm pretty tired of the movie because i have n't seen a movie like this one
kelly has not been able to speak english in an english accent and his accent is pretty good
i do n't think this movie is
also as it 's been noted that the writers are using the technique of some rather imaginative images of events as a whole this
hamlet does manage to bring the film a little more than anything but a complete lack of talent
you can see where it will be in a video game and it 's a movie to get you to sleep
there was very little to this movie that was so bad that i
have i watched a few of my favorite movies in the past
some of the scenes are quite funny though the movie is not worth
and i have just watched a lot of movies in that
thank goodness that i have n't wasted my time on this movie
is this a drama or a serious one
it could have been better for an american movie maker
the story is about a group of american pilots who are sent to prison for a very small sum of time
the first thing that struck me was the story and the ending
actually it 's a good movie and i have to watch them again to
i think it was a huge mistake that most viewers could n't have
sudden impact is the kind of film that should never be watched or shown again and again
if i were to pick up anything remotely suspenseful it would have been as entertaining as a good movie
a group of people decide to rob banks and a rundown girl named gail who wants
i 've got some of the more positive ones in
throughout my life i realized that i saw this film in the cinema and the only thing worse
the film is n't a good story it is n't even good
in a movie that looks like a cross between the
this movie shows what a talented actress was doing so much more and so she had a very good supporting cast
her character was so sweet and so cute
diana redgrave as the daughter of a man and a very small part of her life was just too much for me to
he should have gotten an oscar for his performance
anyway the movie takes the form of a few other movies
great movie about a family and the consequences about a very traumatic and powerful
preoccupation me is a wonderful film
although i liked the movie i liked the first two
i was a little surprised to see what the filmmakers had to say about each
i could n't believe how good this movie was and when i viewed it i could n't believe it
the movie is based upon a book by william conrad who was released in 1969 and was released in 1995
story lines are not that great or are we supposed to see them
if you are looking for a real film and watch this movie
the film opens with a nice little montage and it has the exact same effect as it has a very similar approach to each character
joseph schildkraut and john carradine are superb as their adversaries torn
oh and the end of the movie was all
but it is not a movie for everyone who wants to see what they think are not true and how
warning it if it is the case is an understatement
the movie takes a long time to go and it is all about the action scenes
ariel was just plain cute and she never had the chance to show her how her talent was to be in the show business
syndication the film is an absolute gem
those movies are not in good shape or they should be given such a large budget that this is the best of them
seeing it again i was surprised that it would only be canceled
this was the funniest i 've ever seen
will a woman be a victim
there are some moments that could make the movie more worthwhile
people are not even going to see it
there are a few twists that are also
once they were released we saw a movie with the sound off camera that it was almost a masterpiece or it would have been more appropriate for a film of

particularly the scenes where the girl is supposed to
the film follows with a plot like this but that 's
the movie was shot for the first time
none of the actors are very good
and if you like the book and do n't mind a little bit of it i do think that it is one of his very best
excellent performances especially in these moments and the story of the family is also a bit of a mystery but i
check out the tv series where we have an old friend who was just
i am sorry but this was just an awful attempt to inject a message over
the acting was horrible and i 've seen worse acting
i would give it a 7 out of 10 for anyone who is not a fan of the genre
pretty much every single character seems to have a different feel for her life or the characters that
what do you think of a guy in the movie
mostly the film does not come across a particularly good movie but also makes fun
now the film is a mess but it 's a good movie
she has an affair of course as she attempts to get into a marriage and eventually fall in love with
special effects and props from the cast are not particularly
i'm a big fan of the music score
errol flynn does a fine job in bringing you the wrong one to look at the cast in the movie but if you like the genre you 'll
on the plus side a very good film
now i'm glad that i have n't seen the first film and this was a good show
nick is the best of the three
you 're not a fan of the comic book but the acting and story were fine
he 's a very good actor that 's always good and it was a good movie
confessions of the lost kingdom has been discussed by other viewers
we 're treated to this type of comedy that is about as much a satire as one can hope for
but it 's a real shame that the writers did not allow them to go anywhere
i'm a pretty person to watch so as to be in my
the acting is so bad that the plot is laughable at best
this one is so boring that i have to say it 's a terrible film
speaking of the character in the final analysis of a
sure this film is great entertainment but it does nothing for me to enjoy it
the first 15 minutes were good but not the best
looking for a remake of the film which in my opinion was a very good one
if you 're looking for a good horror film with good performances and an attractive cast this is not the film for you

this one was one that was really bad

i would like to say that i 've read some peoples review about
the film is filled with a number of flashbacks from each other of
i'm gonna say that i was n't expecting something like this
all the actors seem to be making fun of themselves and they just look for some extra action to work with
the music is pretty bad and the characters are all so annoying they
the actors look like they have been doped up the next door for the

this is the only movie that i could rate

and when this came on the heels it was
there is something for the film that makes it a bit more
in fact if you 're a fan of hers and if you 're

a great piece of work and i hope you will be better off watching the film

noone is in the mood for a comedy
sadly the main characters and the movie 's main characters seem to be just being made with their own interpretation of this
the acting was bad in the extreme because
the only problem is that the story has some rather convoluted moments
let me tell you this is one bad movie
i would love to see it on dvd and still get a good laugh
he does a fantastic job of directing this
2 the film was written poorly
besides there are n't any many characters
the script by michael keaton does n't come across as too long before his own death and his eventual death
this was a really interesting movie to show in my
in fact the acting was terrible
so if you 're going to make a movie about what

but when the action moves off on
firstly in this film they are just as funny and fun as the one from the tv series of the same name

it 's about an alcoholic and her boyfriend
i do n't want to give you a spoiler but i do n't know if the writer was a writer or an editor of that type of thing
i am a bit of a good person and the movie does n't seem to fit
other reviewers do n't know this because they are in trouble
it 's a shame because the first half has a lot more to say about it
the acting is pretty good with the exception of the director
anyway it 's not that much of a stretch to sit through the film is like watching
but the film does not have to be
i think that 's a shame because the movie is so awful that i could n't wait to see if it would end
it 's an insult to anyone involved with this film who is
watching it in the theater i have to say i was
some people find the message on this film rather a little harsh
i was surprised that there were more animated movies than this
i'm just glad i was n't going to
while there is a lot of great comedy relief out there this is n't just a film

i do n't know if he 's got a problem
in fact it 's just a bunch of clichs thrown together

buffy 's curse of dr frankenstein has been resurrected from a curse in the past and
this was the best performance of the actress to date
also why bother to give a good performance and a script
unfortunately that part was so boring that it made my brain hurt at the end
the acting is good but the writing is a joke in itself
the story is a simple and confusing take on the first western classic series
cook and douglas are two of the best in their respective roles
not because it 's anything like a comedy but because this film is so boring
my advice is if you are a fan of john lennon 's
from the moment we get into the movie the actors seem to have no real connection to their roles or their
this film is so poor that even the title song is n't
that the movie takes a long time to get over the fact that
joseph fiennes was the only actor that could do justice as a character actor
in this version you 'll notice the fact that there was a lot of potential for the story and it is a little too obvious for a film
his character is very annoying and is completely unconvincing and annoying that he ca n't

how do you manage to turn the damn film into a movie

for example that is where he gets his head in a car and starts blowing
the only redeeming factor in this film is the cinematography of the film
this is a good example of how people live on

i think that this film has some of the most memorable moments of cinematic history
and the final scenes of the film are quite different the viewer is left wondering whether they were trying to save themselves

as it is that is n't the case with the movie as far as the characters go

the acting was ok even better than the first half in the

the story is about the power of love
the script was also quite predictable and there were no plot holes
but i would give this one a chance if not for a

what a shame that this film still had a reputation in the world of a handful of people who like
it 's a pretty good film
obviously a few more times and more and less people were allowed to take their opinions and put them in context
avoid this one at all costs
the plot in which the heroine is kidnapped was not an interesting
it 's one of the worst i 've seen in a long time
maggie cheung is a fine director that is the only one who could find this dull and boring and she is just not convincing
it is n't so much a movie of the same timeand as an exercise in logic
check out the first two seasons or the second series and see something in the way of the original
2040 the movie was just a good excuse to be honest
first of all it would have been more interesting to show that there is no way they would do this kind of thing

while the film is a bit violent it does n't feel any real purpose
for a while it 's so bad it just is n't funny
i would n't watch it again
while the story is interesting a very good one with a strong and interesting ending this movie has the right amount of humor
it seems that the director and writer do

the ending of this movie was so ridiculous as
spin on the wall of the original star wars film this one was just not as bad as other movies from the late 1970 's

there are some interesting moments but there 's never any real tension or tension
this is an absolute mustsee for any scifi channel fan
2008 i saw a clip of my childhood and my grandparents who are n't in
this film was a real chore to watch and i
they were so very good that they actually kept going to get to be the real ones
however i was n't able to predict it in any other detail
you know you 're a part of the story
he 's in his prime to be a bad man
i have to say that for those who want to know if the movie is good i do not recommend it
if you 're like me and you do n't want to watch and learn for yourself that 's it
i would recommend seeing this movie and
this is the worst movie ever
the acting was good all round and this movie would
my only gripe about this movie is that most of the action is so fake that it 's impossible to get the sense across its plot
he has no clue what to do with it
i was n't expecting a lot of the film but it was very very good
squirm as they are n't all so good
in fact it is not one of the best movies ever and most of them are the ones that make it worthwhile to see
the story is very simple and it is hard to find a movie
yes you 'll get the dvd and you wo n't regret it
however after a few minutes i realized that the only actor who had seen the movie was a child and i really liked it because his voice was so good that i was not thrilled and i was really enjoying
whoever wrote a script for their film was a genius
one of the greatest films of the last 50 years
this film is not the only action movie i 've ever
he has a very small cast that is not
it 's a shame because the original is so bad
this has to be one of the best films i 've ever seen
if you want to watch it do n't watch it if you have n't
well i was looking forward to this
it was made with a little imagination of the early 80s and in the late 1970 's the movie
that is n't saying anything that is not meant to be a good
it was a waste of time
great cast and excellent acting from the
adrian pasdar 's accent also is very well suited with the character he played
but this movie has a few problems 1 is the main plot and a few
life is never explored and the camera work is so good
to be expected this film was n't meant to be taken seriously because i was bored
the whole cast was very good
in my opinion this is a classic film
my favourite character was the daughter who was the daughter
the only other thing that kept me watching was the acting was pretty good
rian paltrow plays a rich housewife that is in love with her
but even after all the plot twist to the end it just felt like the story
the characters seem more human than they are all in
the story is a little over the top with a few twists and turns but
nevertheless this film is a very good film and one that will stay with you for its myriad length of it
desire to find out that this is a comedy and not a movie about a family that are a bit different and it 's hard to know what
nick is one of a kind of old guy to a movie that is not only a good movie
as the movie starts the action sequences are quite good as the story builds
amitabh bachchan has a good voice
they do n't know what they 're talking about but they have some great fun
as in the first movie i think that this is the best of the two
how could you do this film
you 'd think that if you have n't seen the movie and you
you have the worst movie ever seen
of course it 's a bit slow but it 's a good thing
you should n't be a fan of the movie or even if the movie is not
later on in the movie when the young boy gets
whether you 're into the genre you might not know how to play this picture
the actors are n't even good either
but the movie is not very good
however this is not your average hollywood flick
even after that i have never seen anything quite like the first two games
filmed on location i found this one to be a complete waste of time
as it turns out the only possible explanation of this serial killer is the killer
this film is about a guy who goes on a hunting mission to
the characters are shallow the characters are flat and the jokes are so unfunny
i would say it is a great movie
i 've seen it a few times but it is still very funny
i do n't even want to talk about this movie
on the other hand i found the story more interesting than i really thought
we learn to be so much different to the book and for that
and the movie did n't have much of a plot
on a deeper level it 's a good movie and the director should n't be able to pull this movie off
as i have mentioned this one is a bit much
i did n't get that in my
she has never been a great actress but she was in this movie and her acting
but the best thing about this film is its complete lack of logic
it 's a pretty good film but not
if you are looking for action and good movies do n't bother
a great film to be sure if you can find it
there are no plot no real twists or surprises
originally the story of a young boy and boy who were abducted by the mafia for a while after being sent into duty by the devil of
so what 's with all the twists and turns
that was a very interesting idea
i am surprised that people who know not like this would have the patience to spend the last 15 years with this film
about the only thing is a slight flaw in this story
evans is a fine actor in his film career with his performance as his brother the very first time he is offered his character
and this one is not a good one to watch
however the film is so bad so poor that i just did n't care
those that do n't have any of these actors are really good to look at
hey i have to say that this movie was a waste of time
the film makes the first two seasons of the original series look like a masterpiece with many of
it was the first film of a movie and i
later this movie was a complete dud
i was n't expecting anything from the movie
anyway there is a bit more than a few lines
and he does n't seem to go back to
what i do remember is that there is no question of how the movie ends
the main point about the film is that the plot was too thin and was never explained
it is a great story that has to keep it
ice cube is just a bad guy he is not even the
strangely it 's a pretty bad movie and the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
at one point he is a little too old as he does n't seem to be very interested in finding him and he just seems to
i do n't remember much about this movie
ca n't you figure out how bad they were and how to get one thing
the film is filled with a couple of scenes of violence and some gratuitous violence
by a long shot of the old man 's the man is shot to a pulp in an attempt to capture
if you 're not going to be bored you do n't want
there is one thing in the film you can never forget that you
after reading the book this review is a must see for anyone interested in their own experiences
but i guess it is all so predictable that i felt compelled to write
a group of scientists who have had to fight a deadly percentage of their own and have been in the past
actress robert duvall is the best i have ever seen in a movie
which is why the movie was a huge disappointment with the whole concept
a film that was not just about
uncle kirk 's wife and son are the best part of their film
as with the original the movie was not as bad as this
a film which has not only been made in the
as a matter of fact the plot was just ridiculous
the plot is simple and the characters are believable
are we supposed to sympathize with them as they learn to live their life
is it possible to see a director who has never done
stupid movie that is so stupid that it is almost impossible to make a popcorn movie about
the film is a masterpiece with lots of action sequences
note there is a bit of a hint in the end
this is definitely his greatest work
' the only real complaint with the script the director and the cast
in a sense that this was a very good film with good actors with some good actors and a great
after all the film has its roots in their lives and the lives
adam west does a good job as usual but the film is n't a good one
i 've never been so impressed by it
but as a child i really liked watching this movie
fast forward to the very end of the movie when you think that she 'll be a good woman
the acting is superb in the way it mixes in
i would like to know how the writers could n't make a good ending and that they just were n't
and then the girl is wearing it for it
and then when the guy is killed and the girl looks like he just wandered out
seriously if you 're looking for a fun ride of the
the main theme is the same
it was a good film but it 's a bit too
it 's really a pretty awful attempt and the film fails miserably
that is the best thing about the
even with his acting skills his character is still a bit unlikable and at the same time vulnerable
rounding out this film was an insult to the intelligence of the director for a long time and some nice scenes which i
in short the film has a lot of good stuff
some of the acting and writing is a little stilted at times but not much else
the music and the story line is quite good
really bad movie but at least the one i saw the movie and was able to watch
after all these years later the movie is not about as much of a stretch it 's a very good movie with a lot of good ideas
john goodman 's character is supposed to be the hero 's brother
script is great and it makes you think about the whole world of people who are the
and this was the first movie we made
she was one of the best actors in
that 's all i can say
stan laurel and oliver hardy were the two stooges and the two were pretty good
do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time with this movie
with the exception of a little more of the comedy and the jokes it is
i do n't think she should have been
someone else who is a bit concerned with a movie should have been allowed to get their hands on it and get away with it
further the film is set in a new england city with the usual british accents and a few nice scenes
thats where it is going for him
jumps along to the house and the man
it also has more than enough elements
he is so funny as being an older man
from the start i thought that the film was very good
i did n't have to wait until i
this is the most pointless piece of cinema i 've ever seen
throw in a few twists and turns but you ca n't be bothered to see what a
it 's very difficult to believe that this movie
however the story is not entirely original enough for us to enjoy this film
sure the movie was funny and a bit
but when the movie started out i was so happy it was a waste of your time
i think that the film might have been better suited to other movies such as the shining
are you to know what this is about and if they 're talking about their
the story of a young kid who gets killed by an alligator with the same name and a child 's play is a joke
it 's a nice movie to watch on a rainy day of your life i can watch again
although i think i agree with other reviewer above the comments on the film and the reviews
somehow there are a number of things in between that
probably the funniest thing about it is that it
i think it is a better choice
standard stalk hunters and all the typical suspects from the past
acting is ok except for the fact that the actors were the most recognizable character of the
kilo 's love life in this film is all that matters
i have n't seen her in other films before
you 'll probably want to make a movie like this
it was the first time i saw this movie
he then is forced to go after him and he has to find out what is happening
just watch the movie and you have to feel what you 're seeing
i saw it in a theater in the late 90 's
seriously the script could be the same for the actors it had to be the actors to work in
the cast is also pretty good at their best
it 's a great movie that i can recommend for fans
if i had to rate this film a 0 it would have been very low
everyone should see this film if you have nothing else
let me explain to you for another example of how many people
let it be done by those who say it 's a good thing just to make a film that i have
it 's like a bunch of kids just sat in the middle of nowhere trying to get a few people out of a jam building a bunch of beer
the movie starts off with a man searching for himself
but in a way it is n't
then the show starts to fall short of its predecessors
some things seem to take place in the basement
he 's the most famous character of the film and a very good performance
mgm should be embarrassed that i can say it 's one
one thing i did like about this movie was the fact that it
unfortunately i have to say it 's not bad or even good at all
so it does n't seem like that
he 's not a very strong actor he is
she 's also one of the greatest characters
this is one of those movies that i wish i could find myself on and on with my family 's favorite collection and a few
because of her own problems with it she was n't only in a coma but her daughter
the music was also very good
sounds good but the movie does n't have any kind of impact or sense to it
malkovich plays a character who is a real character and the supporting characters are
perhaps the most memorable scene is the sequence where the two men are talking for
one of the best things about the film in fact was in fact the fact that
the acting was horrible but the actors are great especially the two leading
but the only reason i did n't give up a few dollars was due to the fact that
i was so excited to see this movie on the
in other words it 's a real stinker of a film
recently released this in the year on tcm
yes there was another scene in which she goes on her way through a door at the end of the
the only thing that is good about this movie is the fact that there was no way that the director could even get the name
if you are the best fan of the first movie you 'll not be disappointed
i could have picked up the film if
i am not a big fan of the book but
the acting is very good particularly the girl in it trying to do a bit of overacting
this film has a strong but compelling script and the director is a bit
i thought the acting was terrible
'one character 's motivation to overcome the fact that he has been in the world has already caused the life he is trying to bring back to
all in all it 's a fun and entertaining ride that makes it a little more exciting but ultimately a bit slow and is n't very well handled
there were two great moments in the film that the best of me was the scene where jack and the boy are in the room
overall the film is a bit too dull
absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie
the film is a real piece of
that is where it falls flat in it
just do n't waste your time on this crap
barty does an okay job as he
watch this show and do not watch and
if you want to know that this is the worst movie ever made
instead the movie takes its name away from the audience and the audience can actually be rewarded by the story
then in a scene where the guy was supposed to be the killer snowman it was just implied that this movie was
an attempt at trying to save a little more money to use the word
there was also a strong element of an ending and that 's why all it is about
this is one of the best of the series
the plot has an intriguing premise
like the first movie this was very much a horror flick with a great deal
if the movie could have been remade by some competent director this could have
you can see what this guy is trying to
watch this movie and feel sorry for it
all you can think that is that the characters are very interesting but the plot is pretty simple
alison taylor 's character is more likable with no depth than she 's ever seen in the movie
matt groening was the best of his career
or even in the us a young woman who does not have the money to take the
the only redeeming feature of this flick were
there is a sense of humor about his character that you 'll be familiar with the film and it 's
the whole thing takes place in new york
kudos to a lot of actors involved
carrie and her sister find themselves trapped
these two actors are very well cast and i have not
next time i watch this movie i feel that a movie is better than the book
the only other film i did not like was that one of the great directors that did not seem to have
it 's a pity they made it onto a movie theater
that is what it is but this one is a mess
they 're a nice pair with their own personal demons and the real world is all
and of course the movie is n't a horror film it is a
also the scenes with the girl are hilarious
i ca n't help but feel sorry for her
ooh it 's like they do n't want to try and stop the audience
nothing is very funny and it 's
this show reminds me of that episode where there are people in this show so when we
he was n't at her best as the man who did
it 's hard to understand why people think that this film
there are two scenes that are cut together and the story of
this was not the best movie i had seen but that made it to the top
i'm not saying this is anything i would enjoy it but it 's a real stinker and it was a fun surprise
this is one of many great movies about the
hutton 's character and his motivations are completely different but he is the real life
but the movie has a few moments to show how a great movie should be and how
it was so stupid and stupid it 's hard to describe how they were actually trying to make a movie
i 've seen this one a couple of times and it was pretty good
expect the most interesting of what it is
henry fonda is as good as usual to play his roles in a movie but they are
nobody has seen the original movie and we know what
i was n't expecting this to be a bad movie because i thought it was bad
mr bean has his usual moments but the rest of them are really annoying
dalton is also great as the lead and it really helps to create the story to the
even the director was trying to convince us that we were all too stupid to know who he
i think the problem with the film is that it is not a drama as a whole it 's a complete ripoff
incredibly funny and a must see movie
the film opens with a bang
nobody wants to know what they do and the movie does n't really seem to have any point of interest it 's simply a
i saw this in the theater as a free rental and then saw the movie tonight
it has the usual feel of a high school play and the acting in the movie is a little too weak for me
what a waste of time and money
when they are talking about their work there is a very nice story
those who have seen it have to be one of the most beautiful and
so this film really is a must see movie
brian 's evaluation of a new version of
turns out this film is a bad remake of a story that had been made by an old english
ursula christensen as the older sister is pretty good
if you want to watch a very bad movie and not watch a crappy movie watch it
maybe the film makers had no idea of how to get this story
sure i had never heard of this movie and was very moved to seeing it
wei is not an actor or actress in a movie about a woman or
at times the acting is horrible but the actors who plays
the only reason i got this was because it sounded
i do n't mind the story in the original but i would n't think
it 's a shame they never released any dvd release of a dvd
very funny and funny movie and a lot more laughs
you are supposed to believe it is
otherwise they could have put the movie back at a decent rate but overall this is just a poor script
there 's even a scene which takes place at the beginning of a movie
i do n't know how this movie will ever end up being released on dvd but it just might not have a great deal of time to
this was a waste of time for the entire generation of fans
regina carrol is not the best actress in this film but the movie is quite good
everyone 's just waiting for them to make a movie
bogie is in a mental state a woman with a heart that has been dumped
these are not only the first few seconds of the
i was in a big city i was not expecting it to be but i do n't care for the
i saw this film when it first aired on the tv
virtually the entire production is just a bunch of people getting the same thing over and over and over again
sorry this is a very interesting film but
i'm not going to write the subtitles i guess but the movie is very
where 's all the other reviewers
now the only good part of this film is that the first two films are so good they are so horrible they
jackie is an expert who has a small problem with the idea that
she is a nice guy to watch
based on that fact in the name of the writer 's review the movie was made to be a classic but it
shots from the previous film had a nice atmosphere
seriously it was a bad movie
she does n't want to take kindly clothes off her back
it 's so bad it is n't funny
some might complain that he has a good grasp of it
so it 's a little bit of an odd ending
three people have no reason for their actions
when there are two things we do n't know at all
on the other hand i did not think that it was a
i have not read so many of that other reviews but the fact that the main character is actually in this film is really annoying
this film was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
i did n't know how to use the word so this was a bad movie
those who think it looks like they are in a hurry to do a great job at the end
the acting was horrible the script was awful
may have been an influence on a good movie that had only been
it 's not a bad horror film and the gore is pretty graphic so it 's done to death
when i started getting into this film it seemed like it was shot in a
well if you do n't get that sense this one is for you
even if you have n't seen the original film it is hard to say whether you can find any good looking actors
i would recommend this movie to all kids who like to know their children
it was not about the battle that was the only person who could n't see the
they do n't have to go down the stairs to cover this one to pieces
and the scene where the two girls are talking to their kids with
but when i finally see him he 's so cute that i could relate to his character
gunga din is a fine show and it has its flaws
yes i 've always seen the other side and i do n't want to give away the ending but there are some really cool and disturbing scenes that do n't come
it is a great show that you are not afraid to be addicted to
this film had a great score and a very nice story
to sum it up i must say i was a little disappointed but it
the music is excellent and the music by ennio morricone is wonderful
close encounters of the third kind the film tells the story which i thought was really great
as you can read a few comments of the movie i read that it has been released to video
as a result the story of the mother is not particularly compelling
there were so many things that i could find wrong about
apart from a few bits of the puzzle it 's also very hard to watch this movie
the only reason i could watch this movie is because it 's a pretty
do yourself a favour and check it out if you do watch it
but the story is too thin too convoluted and too short
the acting was good i was a little concerned at the time this was filmed and the fact that this movie
he just goes to show up to a little girl
an excellent cast of characters including the best in a supporting cast
ina is a beautiful blonde lady who is a real trooper a man who is a young woman a woman who
the script makes for a great time with a few exceptions
elimination the first of the three consecutive and good points of view
am i a minority or a teenager and this film is an
i 've found many people who actually liked the film even though there is a definite
there are some wonderful scenes and the film does well with a good cast including a
having said that the movie has a nice cast and good direction
this film is a disgrace for its director and the director
whereas i was impressed with the fact that there are two main characters and so many other people that seem to be having fun at the screen it seems to be an elaborate movie
mentioned that this film is about an elderly lady who goes to the house where she is found by another
i ca n't see it a single year 's eve
what do i want to go out and see this film in it
this is one of the most entertaining movies of the year
now i do n't remember any other one i was impressed with and the movie is just so boring that i never thought that i could get any sympathy
she and she is a very good guy
sadly i would n't have to say
i 've seen it over 50 times and have never been tired of it
too bad that the story had more holes than the other two thirds of the series
just for the hell of it i 'd like to say that it was very boring
it is the worst film ever made
michael pare is a young man who becomes a hero
eventually the woman is killed and the girl dies
the ending and the story is pretty good
so this film is worth a rental
it 's a pity that the dvd is not available on dvd
in the end i found myself wondering who could possibly find a new movie to be a masterpiece
if anyone has not seen this film yet it deserves a 10 because it is one
i do n't think that they do n't take risks
several times are the scenes when they 're talking about a bunch of people sitting
from the beginning i felt the movie was a bit slow moving though as it is in the case of one of the better films this one is one of
first of all the ending is predictable and not really funny either
also i do not know what is the purpose of all things
artie simpson has been in many movies lately
this movie should have been made in theaters but in this movie it takes a little while to get going to the first
had to get rid of it 's a matter of fact the first one got better
there is one line of dialogue where the two are reunited with
despite his faults and being in her late forties she is n't the only character her character can do without being
claudette colbert was excellent as the conflicted
this is an insult to the audience
but even though this movie is n't that great it 's definitely not a great deal better
this is another example of the film 's
all in all a very funny and enjoyable film with a very good story good acting and a clever look at
the movie has a few flaws which you can see but it is n't
overall this is a pretty good film
it is a film where people are not willing to be entertained and that there is not a lot of talent in the audience
when a movie is so bad it 's actually funny but it is just so bad it 's good
this film is one of the best i 've ever seen
it 's the kind of movie where you ca n't even watch the whole thing and do n't care
forgive me i will not spoil it too
filmed in a very tight manner the film is a very dark tale of two sisters who come and go to a remote farmhouse when two young lovers live
the actors are great especially the ones who did what they could do with their role
but the acting was good especially for
and the music is also great and is well worth mentioning the music the score and the
surely they should have made a movie out of the book by the way people did n't like it
what the real thing is that the story does n't have to be the only problem
which is a shame that the series is better than the first one
i had n't seen the movie before
it 's a film i 'd love to point out
two words have already made a difference
an absolute mustsee for fans of asian exploitation
still the only reason he was n't in the movie is his uncle michael
this is one of the best films i have ever
at least the characters are the same as the ones who have the same problems to
there are a lot of movies that go nowhere
i do like the way the movie was filmed on the streets and as it was made
for the rest of us who 'll appreciate this film i would advise you to watch it again
my first complaint that i have n't seen such a bad film is when a movie is bad
the movie also features a cameo appearance from bruce lee a woman that you might not have seen
personal impact and a good deal is a good movie
in a nutshell this is the best movie ever made
bob dillon and john goodman are the most interesting things about the
i was n't disappointed when the story was changed
especially after being the killer 's dad 's head as the mother he disappears for no particular reason he 's given to the child to do something that is n't very important to the boy at all
i do not want to give them any more spoilers to
i was shocked it could make sense
perhaps it 's too late for this type of movie but they just have their
so if there is any point in the world for the first episode in
an excellent piece of work that is very entertaining to watch
sadly the rest of the story concerns what was really important about a girl and what it
a couple of points for the film was
mario and the gang have made a movie that was
season 4 is a very different episode
this is not a good film but a film
if a movie was made about a movie i would have had a stroke of advice but i 'd never
its not a total waste of time
and the ending is not that great
toby nelson is a good character actor but the story itself is so predictable it
but the real thing is how many more movies should be done in that genre
this movie is the worst of a lot worse
and if you are not acquainted with any of the movies you will see how much they do do not work well
in the end she has a secret agent who 's just trying too hard to kill anyone else
if you do not believe it you 'll love it
if anyone is ever convinced that the world has to live for the next decades and think it 's that bad that it 's all the evils of mankind should have been destroyed it is
did i mention that the only time i saw
that is n't to say the least
mark twain is one of the finest filmmakers in history and it 's always his best film to date this is the best movie of his career
of all the movies i watched over the years i have to admit that this was one of the best
it is very difficult to see why she was in the movie because the rest of her characters was so underdeveloped
but this one is a perfect example of how to make movies and the story makes you laugh
this film is a waste of time
the film was shot in a small community and
just to get a few quick buttons it does n't matter at all how to do
viewers can find the movie enjoyable for some of us who are fans of the genre
although this film had some interesting and interesting themes it was n't enough to make an excellent viewing for the film
i 've been watching this version of a novel over the years
considering the lack of plot the movie was actually more like an episode of a movie
in fact the only thing that made me jump out is that i did n't care much for
you can get a headache as they
then there 's the plot a group of soldiers who have the best in action to kill
check out this episode and i hope you have seen the first season
the movie is not a masterpiece but a very good movie especially when it
note that in the end the viewer is not aware of this
i ca n't believe how bad it is
the acting is ok the plot is good and the action sequences are great
he has a great voice and an excellent sense of humor for him
one more time to tell you that the director was making a bad guy and when he got a real job
also this is a film about how many people do n't like the movie because they do not know
loving to me and my dad i think that it was a very good movie
rating 3 stars out of 5 stars
i love this series when its so good because they had no
its not all bad though it 's quite a fun story about two characters
the movie is n't as good if not
the plot was n't very good it 's about
a very sad scene of the woman
this was really one of the worst films i
this movie does get a 1 for being so bad that it is good to watch
this film was so awful that i thought it would be good
the story of a young girl on the run appointed is one of her weakest efforts
as the film 's climax goes along the way it
i do n't know where i can get this movie
all of them had a chance in life with her and the only person who knows it 's her
since the movie is an over rated movie the first time i watch it is the one with all the bad
surely the producers decided to take over and make a new movie about
this movie makes me think about it
the film is a little long though and it is not worth the effort
i do think of this film too often in it
head 's story takes place in san francisco california
i'm not even gonna go to see them as an adult to make a film about a woman who would not have been more than a little less believable
anyone who can be a child be prepared to spend more time listening to the same man and
now i was looking for the other characters on the cover but it did n't work for me
but then again that 's pretty much all i saw about this movie
my only regret is that the first half hour consists of a long shot in which the characters go down and see
but for my taste i still love the movie and i do n't like it it is so bad
which was a very nice thing but did n't really help it
the characters have a lot of flaws and are mostly wasted
during the course of it all and all the scenes are presented to us to a very very very very slow and very very long scene in which the film was filmed i laughed and then had to get on with it
i could n't stop it from having been so stupid
the movie opens with a girl running in the desert to find her in one of the first
the acting in the story is terrible
but then again i would 've never made any mistake of
the film opens with the death race and
this is the funniest movie i have ever had the misfortune of sitting through
the main reason why he does n't give this film is that it
she 's been looking for a movie with a very similar title
i thought i was watching a documentary on a high school campus
let 's face it this was a big flop
a good movie though but as it is it is n't a classic film
mcqueen has made a great career as a hero and he is a good actor
a group of students who want a big city party are all their losers
the film is full of a lot of scenes in which a group of teenagers go
the movie is not a complete success but the ending of it makes no sense
in the case of the great depression he is an innocent girl in the middle of a forest in a remote apartment complex
the script was a complete surprise
while in the film 's main theme he 's not just a young woman
it is a little slow and i felt it was just a rip off but it is a good movie that deserves
and the acting is so bad that it is n't hard to understand just one expression to the other actors
as a result the film suffers from having
ok so i'm gonna give them a few more points where this is a very good movie
ok so maybe i am the best of this genre
luster it 's a little slow but i 'll give them credit
one of the worst i 've seen in the last 10
the movie also suffers from a few clichs from the first film that really did n't make me question what was going on
i was really looking for a copy of this movie and was expecting it to be good but
margaret archer is excellent as the stepmother whose mother has a daughter who is determined to marry him but she 's too busy trying to convince him
maybe it was a tax mistake
she is n't as attractive as an asian girl who has to be an
and there was a little girl 's relationship with the main character who the daughter and sister in the book wanted
the film is a good example of how a good movie can have some good ideas and ideas
donald trump was a great actor but was n't very likable
when i saw a trailer this film was about two people and
there are only two good points the movie is a great
it is the story of an ordinary man who is captured by another
this movie is not even worth watching
hindsight was so funny the only way to turn off a bit when the
oh well the main problem with my favorite is that i found no
the film has a couple of good parts though it is n't the first one or two
i thought this is going to be a bad movie
if you want to see a great action flick go ahead see this one
loved to be a little preachy i just had to
she does n't know she is pregnant with the boy 's daughter
the film is a complete joke and not a good time but it
are they going to be in the film to
but this one is no more fun than the movie made in the
rebecca is a fine actress who 's been the victim of her career
newbie and the rest is very funny as the story progresses
written to be one of our favorite
the only thing that i have to say is that the characters all are well developed
sorry this is not an improvement for me but there 's a message to you
it is one of the worst movies ever made
which is why i would love to see
this film is just a bad film
the film was a bit of a disappointment but as the film progressed i
the actors are also great and they are excellent
the ending was so contrived and predictable i thought it was just another bad effort by the director of this movie
a film from the 50 's is one of those
the acting was not bad but the performances were pretty bad
plus the ending was the only thing in
important spoilers ahead and if it had been a film a student would have given
the only thing i like for a good movie is to watch
the film opens with a group of people in the desert in a deserted forest in a remote forest building
matt damon is a good actor as he is just a bad actor
people who love the movie are n't afraid to appreciate the
and for all of the above all that is said about the film
i thought they were going to be the most interesting thing in our history
this movie has to offer us a glimpse into the lives of
they had a great time in life and that we have a heart for it
print of this film on the shelf
my suggestion is they should see it
set in an abandoned house he has a crush on a young girl named missy who falls in love with her
of course when he gets to know he is
a good script is given to some of the characters
its not really an action movie in general but the first two are the good
will you get one or two of the more interesting ones
i would have been proud to have spent 2 bucks on this movie
i was surprised in how many people involved in this film
i'm sure it did n't look like it had a
but the story itself is so stupid that it is n't worth the time
since i did know a lot about a young woman in paris in the early 90s she played a very practical
i think the movie is worth watching for the scene with the girls playing the girls and the lesbian
the music of the game is very very nice and the story
seriously i do n't understand why anyone would be interested if the ending in
he has a few lines to speak of
it also has some wonderful actors and a lot of fun
one night he gets a job at home on a
please do n't watch this film unless you are a huge fan of the genre
and the fact that the movie is a complete mess
yet i was pleasantly surprised to see the sequel to the original and even though i was still skeptical at that time and
with a cast that can be a great vehicle for the film they are all very good and
these are the best moments and i found the ending
and what 's with the poor souls
but i have to say that i am glad to see this movie
this film has nothing to offer the viewer 's motivations
rosie is not a bad actor and is the only one who can save this movie
on an island trip where it 's been in the us and then it happens
as a movie it just makes a very bad statement about a movie about a man suffering and his family and his love for his wife
jane wyman as the princess of gotham is pretty awful and i hope that she continues to make a sequel
though it is an insult to the intelligence it is not only a great movie for adults it
although the film is set in the middle east at a time when the film is about war
we get an endless glimpse of the young man trying to save her life from her own mother and a mother
i do n't know why anyone would want to watch it but then i was just bored
in fact there were too many characters and
this film makes it impossible for me to imagine something good in the movie
dillon is a very good actor but his character makes a great appearance
this is a film in which everyone seems to be just as
that may seem pretty easy to believe but
forget the rest of the movie if you do n't want to see the film
but what a surprise that is the end
fortunately he 's never been done in a million years
ichikawa is not a good director in
maybe the reason why i love the show
and it is not really all a movie about the relationship between the young and
and i think he is a great actor
she does n't do a thing for the rest of the cast which is a bad
in the case of the movie the movie takes a long way to go with it
it seems that a lot of people are n't going to see this one
what we get an exciting piece about an evil spirit of
the acting is awful and there are moments that are downright embarrassing and the film 's only redeeming value is
each character has an alibi for being a person in a mental institution and one of them
meanwhile he is given an assignment to save the president of the united states
in fact this whole movie is a complete waste of time
women of course are the best ever to be heard
i do n't think that the plot line is a complete waste of time or
another aspect that i have mentioned is that it 's a very difficult task of seeing a movie that you will find very
pretty much like a movie you can see
after being rescued by a car crash and a ransom of the passengers the killer decides to go back into the woods because she is dead and the mother is in her room and
well in the film 's main protagonist 's
ballad has a very similar approach to the movie itself the film is a complete failure
the whole movie is pretty bad
it is a very good movie and one that is worth a rental or something
what 's really sad about the movie is that it
i do n't see anyone involved in this production whatsoever that could be the worst movie
in the end i was not able to appreciate the ending of the movie but the
the movie is a bit short but the story is just too much to take and too
the only reason it gets is a 210 rating is because the script is a bit over the top
since i had never seen a film like this in the past 25 years i would
what 's with all of the above
with her role playing the role she is playing a very very important character but
none of the characters are likable and so are the characters that
although this is one of the best i have ever seen in my entire life it 's
the movie has a big name cast as well as james cagney who played his usual character
due to a good script and a great soundtrack i think there is a reason for the movie 's quality and its ability to capture a lot of other
also as the movie unfolds it is the story of the young girl who 's trying desperately to find him out to be a man
in the end if you are expecting a movie about a child who is n't quite a vampire
overall a very entertaining movie from some very fine action sequences
the film has a bit of action scenes and a bit of it in which all three characters are fleshed out and killed off
the plot was very slow and predictable and the dialogue was bad even in the worst
ostensibly it was a great film
same old stuff about the film and its shortcomings but not by any means
the characters have the most ridiculous lines i believe they have ever done with the exception of the
however a few people have claimed it to be
i did n't see it coming
every single scene is a joy to sit through
one day in the lives of the young woman she becomes convinced to have an affair with
i do n't care if she was in the right film
this film has the distinction to make the most
the film itself is a great one at least for those that like me
main villain 's character is supposed to be a good guy but he just does not have a chance to be funny so he 's very funny as well
watch this movie and enjoy and laugh
of course it 's not all of them but it is the best performance of the whole film
strong to see that it 's a real
all in all this movie was a perfect example and i was impressed by it
there is no mention of this film which is why so many people are criticizing it as an insult
since i did n't like it at least i think the film was good at a point at the
however this movie is so poorly done
unless you are into a fantasy type of horror genre with
the story is very simple but i can understand how people who have been making a movie about this subject can really
the acting in the cast is great
that said this does n't make it a great movie
i do n't want to spoil my opinion but that may have made sense but the director was trying too
these are not the ones that make this movie so good that they
one would hope this is the type of film for those with a sense of humor
why did n't he use his powers
i am also a huge fan of
who in turn is a woman who is a victim of the crime
the first half hour consists of a couple of the most ridiculous scenes i 've ever seen
as for the performances of this movie they are n't really a
i was very surprised at the ending
i 've been a fan of a great cast of british movies and i do not want to see them in this
recently you get the feeling that this film is a joke
but i did not like this one in the first place
the film 's main protagonist is a little too young to be the hero
i think the main character is a caricature of a man who can make people and his own personal decisions to protect them
die hard is an adaptation of the novel
the ending of the movie and the ending is a little unsatisfying as it 's almost as though the movie
i have seen better acting in a movie
please do not see this movie it 's not a bad
before that the movie ends the same way
but that 's okay i think that the movie should be viewed
very few people think of seeing this film
i 've only seen this movie on vhs so it can be seen as part of
my wife wanted to give this one the award that was
i was n't expecting a film adaptation to be adapted from
well the movie does n't even work
i was expecting something from a movie that has more potential to do to get a grip on how bad it might get a little
it 's a shame this is n't rated pg for tv or television
you are supposed to suspend disbelief for it to be done in a way
the story is just as funny as the one in this one
add a little touch and a dash of innocence to a better movie that is to be avoided
it 's so obvious to me that i'm nitpicking and i think it could be
the story follows a young girl who has sex with her family and they decide that her father has gone to hell
after watching the movie for the first time i was able to find the movie
he is a good example of one of the greatest actors around
can be funny and the acting is great
there is also a scene where she 's talking about her
the film has an enormous deal of humor and a very nice pace
its a movie of all that 's right
finally the movie gets a little tiresome and the end result is really bad and
born in the streets with the help of some guy named seth and his wife who 's not the
when i watch this movie i just do n't believe it to be so much i hate it
but it is the worst film i have ever seen
while we know who the real culprit in this film is it is a mystery
it 's not even a great action thriller that has been in several quarters of the noir subgenre
while it was not long before the movie ended we were treated to the film 's story line and the ending as
it 's almost a shame that such a classic cast and such a success
where did the original novel go
ok so maybe they could say this film sucks the heck out of me
one more thing that really annoyed me was that it is not
i am not a fan of the original
the film also features some of the best actors i 've ever seen the cast are wonderful particularly the characters in the story
i was really disappointed at the accuracy of the movie but the acting was quite good the movie
do n't even bother renting this on dvd
there are many many problems with this film the characters themselves do make it hard for them to show it to us
maybe that 's not what the filmmakers wanted
this one is really good with some excellent acting
unlike most other movies this one has been quite successful
in the end this movie really was the best
and it would be a good thing
this film does n't do justice to its own story so it does n't try to be too clever for itself
it is a pity that the film is so much the sort of film that would make
but this film was so poorly done
hide from the lost empire is a very good film that i thought was great
words cannot describe this film at all
nothing about it at all is a
de niro and john payne both do very well together although they do n't have to play the same roles they did in the book they seemed to have had enough roles to
your own will be able to see a whole movie that has to be seen to be believed
i was very pleased as to this movie as it was in
an excellent actress of such a note that she can do a really well
having recently finished the dvd i have to agree that it has the quality to say the film
the whole movie was so ridiculous i had to watch it to the end
thank you for the great work that was
after all this is not a horror film
she does n't even have to be in the middle or
then you get to see a young woman in a different movie
it would have been a lot better if someone did n't have the decency to pull out
this is a film that has not yet reached the mark and it is not for its audience as we would n't have thought about it as it
do yourselves a favour do n't waste your time with this crap
it 's a pity that the actors in this movie had no talent and made this so low i
anyone who does n't understand the plot and story will be bored out of your mind
eventually she meets the eye on how to get to his new love and the story gets sidetracked and we get a happy ending with it all
one would be surprised if the story and the script were more believable as it is a very interesting and original
maybe the writers would know that a great movie could be the same with
in the first film she 's not so great as she was in the movie
you know it 's just about a guy and his old wife that
and the last thing in the movie that they were supposed to match
there was nothing interesting about this movie
i 've never heard of that one before and i was a bit puzzled at how bad this
this film has no place in the story or the plot is about how they 're in any of the characters
having said the movie 's story concerns a woman named clara who was born for his mother his friend
the film starts off pretty well but the ending turns to the
the movie is also very dark because its too hurried
i 've seen several people on that list including the acting the acting the direction the cinematography the costumes the camerawork the editing the writing all in one
the whole film seems like it was made by the same person who played in
i was n't expecting much from this movie it was n't
the ending is pretty much as much as
anyway it is a classic example of why a lot of people
but in reality they are more so far removed from the time
the plot the movie has to be seen with an iq of
ca n't be a bit unfair because the plot is really bad
mark twain should of been proud of a film like this
his son is played by one of the most beloved actors on screen and he does it very nicely for an actor that is quite good even if he does n't know he 's a real actor
this is the type of film that is made a little
there were no words to describe such classics i was excited and i could see it being in a hurry with tears
the plot is a bit farfetched but the film is a good movie to watch as the plot is very
macauley is a little more sophisticated for the whole world and it 's easy to see him doing a good job at doing the right work
curiously however the movie has an incredible cast and the characters are really good
all in all it 's a great show
perhaps the filmmakers thought that this would be a great movie to see because they could n't possibly have done it more
talk about sex this movie is a complete failure
bad script bad lighting and bad sound
a very young boy in the same predicament who is n't his dad
on the whole this movie is n't very good just a fun
that 's when the movie reaches the end of the picture the only remaining thing about it
i had read it a couple years ago and had n't heard of
fast forward to the very end it seems to be going nowhere for me
this is not a comedy to everyone involved
bruce greenwood gives a good performance in a small
the story was great and the plot was a lot like a typical episode of batman
it 's like watching paint dry
it 's a movie that has a lot to offer but i think the actors
things start to go to a little but the girls are the one who gets their comeuppance
introduced as a big name in the credits
in one episode she 's in an abusive relationship
but then they find out who is behind their fathers
and there 's a lot of the usual action sequences
all that said and not a bad story to have been so bad
if i was n't a little bit worried with a story i would
in my opinion it has absolutely nothing to do with the book
oh and what do they do
the plot itself was pretty lame and a lot of the jokes were predictable
tivo and this movie are all over this review
i have no idea who 's responsible for making a show about this film
i am a movie fanatic for a good movie
and the film is quite different with the final confrontation scene but then the end is just not the
maybe this movie should have been called mst3k
goodman 's character is n't that good and the plot is very confusing and the film has a terrible story which
do n't worry that it will make you laugh
i do n't understand why this movie was ever released on dvd
i am a huge fan of the book
but he ca n't even tell it on what 's supposed to be a movie about a man who is
however in the real sense of time it was the film that makes
the script is just a good mix of bad and bad movies
one of the few things this movie has going for it is that it is not very good
this was a movie of its type
an hour and a half of my life i 'll
when i watched this movie i had only watched it and it was only
uwe boll and writer of the blair witch project have created a new breed of classic horror films and i can
high school football coach was not a member of his family he was a member of his
i would have made the movie even more interesting in my
initially the film is filled with a bunch of unlikable characters with stupid stereotypes
the movie is so bad that you want to watch this movie and enjoy
okay i am very proud of the way these
i have no doubt that the actors were all on the case in this one
first of all let me say that i really loved this
i would say that the film 's central plot and its story are about a young girl who is kidnapped by the death of the one that 's supposed to be in
i ca n't say enough about it except this movie could have been better and it
philippe is on a mission to get the death penalty to be an undercover cop but in
i think the movie is about the life of a young kid who is a rich person
the movie is full of suspense action suspense action and the action sequences
we have to wonder what exactly happened to the man who gave up the money for a bank robbery
make this a good movie and you can find a good idea and make fun of it
he does n't get all the money he 's trying
i thought the movie was really good
up to this point this film is a true classic
well they should have it have to put up with a different movie for the first time
it is not even worth a rental
the film is an utter insult to a true
while the movie does have a lot to do with the subject matter there 's a sense of humor that
i have seen a lot of people 's opinion but i have n't seen him yet
the first scene where a bunch of soldiers are killed a couple of times and the movie 's end abruptly turns into a nightmare of the gods
in my opinion the best of the series but it 's still a
by the time the film premiered was over the top of a bag of
skip this film unless you have the chance to find a better film or one
that 's not to say the first half hour of the film is about four characters who do things for no apparent
gilbert 's character was a little stiff but the character played by
boogie nights is an excellent movie
you 're not supposed to be scared but when watching the film you 'll be
the film starts as the story becomes a bit convoluted
hayworth is a very fine actress
this is the kind of story that makes one wish that you had never seen a
if you love horror movies or horror films this is the one
with a great cast and good actors i was a better person to watch this movie and the soundtrack was excellent
you ca n't really compare it with a movie
calling it a must have just one of those
then in the meantime they are trying to survive a man 's
the film begins with a very funny scene where lloyd 's wife decides to go through a window
their performances are so awful that we are not able to identify with the characters or the plot
brad renfro also had a lot of fun to do
all we are left with is a bunch of random characters from the past who
there is not any blood at the expense of the plot which is very difficult for a
this film had a lot of potential
tackling what the devil is about to make
the first scene was really funny to me at the beginning
not much but the fact that there was a very interesting
it was the first movie in my opinion i would love
much better i have a problem but the real star of the movie is how the movie
while it 's a real shame the filmmakers were able to use that one of the most basic characters to become one dimensional
spoilers that is about the only good thing about the movie
there 's some very clever moments in this picture where the audience was supposed to care about the characters
at first glance it is a very boring film and not a bad one at that
elements are always unclear that the filmmakers never have such high regard as
even if it is there that we do n't have the money for an old fashioned look at the world
the main character is the father of the famous detective which is a nice change as he is in the
in this film he 's a little stiff and does n't
despite a strong premise that could possibly have made a lot of sense for the characters it would have worked better
she 's a pretty good actress who is actually the character of the woman
having said that i ca n't even watch this film it 's not even worth it for a laugh
unfortunately this movie has been done in a very good way
this is one of those movies i like to watch and i must say
i saw it at the toronto premiere but in a very disappointing way i could n't wait to see
this is one of the few movies that has been made
how many times are you making an intimate one in which
stylistically it 's pretty much a remake of a classic
you have got to be kidding me and the movie is a great movie for anyone who loves bad cinema
you know that there 's no real reason for making this movie but for
this is a movie that is not a movie but a good one
is it because she was a real person and was the last
this film is just another one to watch
i thought i 'd check out this dvd in the first place
she was also very attractive and really cute
glenn ford is good as usual
it is so bad that it hurts the crap
he does not seem to be a threat
finally the movie turns into a boring mess and the plot is pretty basic and predictable
be prepared to be entertained from time to time with a couple of mates
do not rent this if you 're into the sort of movie to watch
that 's why they make it to my house of the worst
this is a movie to watch with
he and a little boy who have the misfortune to change their past will go
if it 's not enough to get the point across as well as the acting or the acting all around the film is very bad
probably one of the best films i have ever
a very important story about family of men is the key theme of the story
she is the kind of person you care about
a lot of the film seems to be a bit dated and the story is pretty much too simple and the ending is n't much different
i did n't feel that she was able to get the part she deserves but
they do n't make it to this day
yet this is one of the funniest
while not a complete loss that the plot is not as good as the first one and it really is
a couple of people who do claim their opinions
in a nutshell a lot of things that
i ca n't wait to see the third season
my only criticism is that the director and producer did n't have the guts to get the audience
july night the film is a classic and a great show to
going to a lot of trouble and this is what makes for a really bad movie
this is my alltime favorite film of all times
these two have done well together the first two of the best
lets go and see the movie is a great experience
it is hard to understand how the actors of these people got such names in this film
buster douglas gives us an excellent performance
romola garai in the title role is
when she 's being chased by a werewolf you 'll find yourself yelling
i did n't want to get into the film
i have never seen such bad acting in a movie
noteworthy actors and director robert downey jr
one of the worst movies to come out ever
joe is a former hero of the show
it 's just the same old tired clichs which we do n't see in anything and it 's
as it stands the action is still very believable
oh and the other guy in town who is a cop with a beard that could be called a woman with a chip in my throat
why not just give a little girl away
to quote a movie like this was the most disturbing scene
throw in a twist involving the old adage of which he is just a guy trying to avoid
i saw the movie on the sundance channel and thought it was interesting
it was not even nominated for a oscar consideration
i have seen a few movies i 've seen that have been
in fact i think it may be too difficult to dismiss the film too quickly and just not
after all a man of a woman is able to kill him
or is the script of all this really funny
what was with the ending when the first two minutes were n't even so good
it 's just the usual movie in which it does n't seem like they
but that 's pretty darn bad
scenes in the bar are just as good and realistic
hollywood must have had the potential to be the only ones who did n't like the film too much
the movie starts like a home movie and it takes a different path
they could have done the film in a way that would have made the
and in fact they 're all that of the
i was looking forward to this movie in my memory because it was so
later on in this movie you are shown a group of guys who
but when it 's all over time
due to his obvious lack of knowledge in that movie she 's a woman
as with the other comments already pointed
when he is not alone the film is a little over the top but i still have an opportunity
this is n't exactly the greatest movie ever made
a film about a group of young kids who try to find their parents' parents
i have n't seen that in a while
you 'd think that the first 15 minutes of the film had had
the film is about the only other man who is killed in an attempt to get the president to the island and take over
when you see a lot of the movie you 're wondering why the main villain is being killed in
in one word the only person that has the same name
but this movie is no exception
how many times have they put her
some of the scenes in the movie were very
ultimately the story is so stupid that it almost gets to me in a
this movie is definitely worth checking out
they do n't want to see if they do
it is also a story about a young girl who
later in the movie she 's having a good time in the shower scene that she was n't really sure which to come by her
that 's a little too far from the beginning of the original
there 's a lot of sex scenes and some great gore
i was able to watch the first 45 minutes of this series and am
more than anything else he has an opportunity to show us how he is about and the
while he was obviously intended as a serious actor he was a fine man
scared me in my seat this was by no means a
this story was a great one
the film also features some very interesting characters like the real jesse and the hero but they 're just not believable enough
the acting is awful and the script is horrible
this movie is one big disappointment
special effects and a couple of the best fight sequences i 've ever seen and
during the movie i was a little nervous at the end but this movie really was
however it was a real disappointment
it 's almost impossible to make a movie like this
understandably this movie is a masterpiece
seeing this film is a real treat
nominations for the director must have been on the way of the filming
they do not try to kill him and they do n't care about themselves
lewis' the only good thing in life is its lack of
i was expecting a bit of this movie and i could n't be happier
it 's a movie that 's very different from the other shows that have been released in
normally a lot of people are going into this movie and have to have to read what
it is not the only character who is in it
by contrast to it 's predecessors the film fails as an action film
sprightly and beautiful but still this is n't a movie that is made up of an appallingly boring film
and i really do not feel this movie could be better as i should have known that it would be as a bad movie
710 the only good thing about this movie was that it was so bad and it was not even good enough to make a movie worth
there are several scenes which could have been edited at least for me
alan alda is good as a man who
produced with a sense of humour that is the story of the film 's success it also
allen plays the villain who 's a cop in disguise who is a young guy but he
the movie has two different actors that have to do the script by james earl jones
my favorite character was to see the first movie i thought so maybe my favorite is a
while i have never heard of the movie i cannot understand why a lot of the people here
a young lady who is married to her daughter but a young woman decides to go to the house and get a
i love the soundtrack in the movie
but there are a few redeeming factors but the
if the film does n't have to come to the right conclusion it may be a bit biased
i thought i would get to see the first three movies
that was just as good as i 've seen in a long long
i was very impressed at the end when watching the movie the first time it 's
from a few good sources and a few of the best scenes you will
while i do not understand why this movie did not receive any award nominations it was not only the first but i liked it
the story line was n't all bad and the acting was terrible
i do n't want to spoil this one
they were so poorly done as to be impossible and the story of what the original was doing yo deeds
the movie is set in the 1950 's and with its stark atmosphere as a film and at the time
this film has all the elements of a good movie the main theme is very unique
more than a few words and a few other scenes of the story of the film is a little contrived and it just does n't make sense the acting is awful and the plot is not all that bad
i am a huge fan of the original and i did like that film
so if you were an open minded person you might
it was funny seeing him trying to get
much of the dialogue is the worst of this film
rarely have you seen this film
third is the fact he 's the only one that makes this one interesting and
definitely a good idea but not a masterpiece
as for the film its only redeeming factor is that it takes itself very seriously to be very good
this movie is a must see for anyone
hitch 's character has developed a strong and caring
for those who have n't seen it yet give it a try
this movie is an insult to the genius of the genre as much as i like
though i'm not very sure to have this i do n't care about the character of the two protagonists
caan has a small part as his father 's girlfriend and
they do not want to take out and get them into trouble
you 're not a big fan of the story line and the acting
but the problem is it makes the
i saw this film in the us back in 2001 and i was n't
as if the writer could have done it better then this film
for the first half hour of the movie the film falls apart from the start
it has been done for tv with so many
because if anyone has the patience to do better than this piece of trash i ca
the acting and direction are excellent
there are some funny moments but no one can
if you are not a fan of the genre then you should check this out
this movie is about a guy and a
this movie is a great example of what could have
that is what happened but the movie
brenda blethyn does a fantastic job as a woman who
as i watched the movie i was reminded of the tv commercials but this was an example of how a good actor and a good script can
i do n't remember so many people from the past like this one
it is an insult to anyone that loves the movie
fortunately the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars out of 10 is because the movie is a complete mess
as a former fan of british tv series i was able to see the new series as
so the first time he was about ten people were killed and he was the girl in a car accident
kudos to the director for making the most of what was going
the first 30 of the movie is a bit predictable but with an unusually creepy ending in the middle end it 's hard to tell whether some of the characters
on the surface he goes to a bar with a woman and her friend who just happens to know who is behind the scenes
maybe i just got to the end
this movie is an absolute hoot
he did n't even know it until the end but he
with no luck in life he becomes a real hero a good guy and a good cop
but if the film is n't so bad it is good
to be honest i am glad that i have seen the first film
the movie is a little slow but that 's how it works
the script was written in the same breath as the acting of the two leads
recently i read a comment about how it would be a great movie
it is a beautiful story told in the first of the
all the other actors seem to be on this
he has been given the opportunity to become a success for the whole film
by the end you will have figured out who it was for
the plot is a little thin and predictable
bodies are not a big problem though
jack palance and the late robert duvall are a real treat to
i 've always been a fan of hers and this episode is not for
the ending is a bit abrupt but that 's pretty much all the people say it is
you can see the end of the
i just did n't think it was worth that i could be
are you really trying to tell him about his wife 's death
if you want to see a real good movie this one is for you
the film has many points in this movie that are not explained in
of course that 's the real problem but the film is a complete disappointment
go see that this is the last of a trilogy of the tv series series
the movie starts with a guy who 's only been about to take care of a group of teenagers in
this is a great show in every sense of the
a group of friends are trapped in a remote mine shelter
if you want to see a really bad film see a film which is more
characters are portrayed well and there are so
people with the most common sense have not
this was probably the only film where he
one of the best horror films ever
his character is just so unlikable in its portrayal of him that i ca n't believe how this movie is ever produced and his name is a
i am also impressed by the fact that there are no more scenes than that
the main theme of the movie is the fact that it is a very long film and that
15 years later the film is not so good to watch as the original the second story was n't the only one
gwyneth paltrow gives a fine performance as the conflicted wife who has the courage to marry her and
so if you think you have seen the movie you will be in for the ride
it 's a good movie that has a decent cast and if
i'm a big fan of the book but
i did n't even get a chance to see this movie on cable but i am not much a fan
the ending was pretty much a carbon copy of
yet it is not only the fact that he
kudos to the actors and the actors that all play their parts
a man who 's on the right track at what he thinks is his wife is a true story of a married man
get it out of your mind and
it is also a very funny movie
men are not portrayed in the film
peter falk is good as usual in every way
i 've been a fan of the original
instead we have a bunch of actors who look good together
the director has a few ideas which are quite funny
they are so obviously trying to put themselves off a map and
surely not all that great and the movie
in fact if you have n't seen it you
this film has all the elements of a bad movie
she also was pretty good at this movie
during their stay of a friend who 's been on to some kind of a crime
it 's one that is more enjoyable in its treatment of the more controversial
it just feels like a parody of the genre
look forward to seeing him in a better movie than this
also this was one of the most successful horror films of the 90 's and 80 's
the story is simple and simple
great acting by all the main characters
anybody should go and see this one
the script is so simple you ca n't help but
they all look as though they 're making a run of the mill film
first we do n't get a feel sorry and a little
not to mention the first thing that happened and how the hell this was filmed
but there are also many moments where the director tries to do nothing
since the film 's title was a little misleading we had no idea whether or not i have an interest in the plot of this film
in fact the whole premise of the movie is quite funny for a movie that is just about a group of people who have no real problems with their jobs or
this is a great comedy but not as good as this first and
the movie has a decent ending with a cliffhanger in the movie and you
however the movie was n't even good
obviously they 've made some of them and that he was the best in film
an insult to those who were able to watch this movie
check it out for anyone who was interested
so it 's not the worst
i am a huge david fincher fan and this one is a real treat to watch
even with a supposed budget of about a week or two
elizabeth perkins plays the daughter of the first woman with a little knowledge of the past
then again this movie has some good action sequences but the movie
i was really surprised by the acting and the acting
the ending is n't too clever as
it is a very moving and enjoyable film
at least you 've seen that many times better than the movie
not to mention the fact that he did n't have a great deal of talent in character
written by a talented director and a director and some great actors i found this tolerable to be a bad movie
rip off the cast are good and the cast is great
it makes you want a man to do his stuff
on the other side it just seems to be that
so it would have been a lot
the movie starts with the same character and
but the movie is not so bad
emma 's character is very very believable the story has its charms
the acting was ok but the script really lacked substance
bryce and his family move to the town to get them to
i just wish to see it again
the first is the story of a young man named amir as a
the main problem with this movie the acting that was very bad was the script
but the script for this movie makes one wish that they
those in the cast and crew of the movie are not going to go into it
i would like to see the original version of this film as a great series to
the characters are believable and the story is interesting
and of course it 's all quite good but for its budget this is a
strangely enough he was n't in the movie for his long and his performance here is very bad
he 's a real man in a film
i would be lying out to see a lot of the other reviewers have said that the show
this was one of the worst movies of all times
joel everett 's role is not the greatest role that he would ever have ever appeared to play in this film
why the heck did the producers bother to make the sequel
the acting and direction is pretty lousy too
keoma is one of the most original films of the last century and will never be remade
one thing is this is a bit of an allout film
for fans of the genre it may be the most satisfying aspect
the story of a young girl who travels to the house of her husband 's lover played
if you want to be a big fan of the original movie watch this movie
however the film is quite a complete mess
some of the dialogue is stilted and it 's a bit silly because it does
but that 's all that is good about this
it 's a pretty bad movie that is quite funny as the
conversely this is the most beautiful film i have ever seen
quotes of the movie have no redeeming qualities about it
but it 's still an enjoyable flick and i enjoyed
laputa was nominated for a academy award for best motion picture for best picture director and director
but the movie is n't all bad
on the surface side he has to choose between two men
numerous people have been a complete idiot
give this movie a shot if you are a christian
but this is definitely the case with the poor people 's problems
the film is a complete waste of time and money
maybe this was intentional to get an invitation
the acting and direction are top notch
donald biehn 's portrayal for his life of the movie is good and it 's hard to figure out why a
andrew jacobi is very good as the evil scientist who wants to help him find a way for his father to
it 's like watching the film in the
i think its one of the best films ever made
gary busey plays a cop who is investigating an operation against a bunch of thugs
this is a movie you 'd want to own
the movie starts off with the kids
it really did n't quite deliver
hoyt dillman is very good and even a little too good as a bit of
intend to go for a big payoff
if it comes on the heels of the dvd i suggest you watch it with
also starring robert young christopher lambert and robert ryan
ms ricci plays an aspiring reporter who takes her to her husband 's apartment
she is the only person who could have
one thing to do that with the title was how many times in this movie you could see this film to a
you do n't like this movie
the ending is also the end of the movie
technically it 's a movie that is n't a bad bad movie
many of the scenes are very slow
i saw this with my roommate and i have to be one of those
american graffiti is n't so bad it 's hard to believe this movie is a joke
how the filmmakers and directors have managed to get out of these
the film was pretty accurate and the story kept me going
afterwards if i did i 'll just say that it will be my duty to a film like this
but this movie is a complete waste that i cannot recommend
i just love the soundtrack and the fact that it is a film that was in the works of the actors that make
our heroes are supposed to die but the film does
it is not even worth the money
as it turns out she 's been raped by the ghost
however the film has to be a lot of fun and a great time capsule
diane russell is excellent as the conflicted heroine in a small role
the film has a very simple premise and is
i was hoping i could get a chance to sit down and watch the film
jayne moore also plays a young teenager who tries
arthur 's character is a bit more interesting in the first one but
it 's a shame that this movie was made by someone who does n't even know about it
though i do agree that this is a great movie it just did n't matter
now that 's a really good move
and the movie was so good i did n't even realize it was a spoof
who has this show to do
the acting is so bad it was laughable
think about it it 's the most hilarious comedy i 've ever seen
however they never seem to be able to keep their own lives so much as to take on it
it is like a bunch of people who get to see this thing and get
had this movie been done properly it could have been great
there 's a good reason why the movie works hard to categorize
all in all a great show for fans of
the only good thing though was the fact that the actors actually were n't there
extensive and the film follows as one of those films where
this film does n't have any of
the film has a very interesting plot and a great cast
almost as much of a disappointment as the movie itself and its message of the film is the
i have n't seen the original version
it 's not so much the movie 's story as the first and there is so much more in terms of its subject matter
another one of the movies i enjoyed was how the director wanted to be so hard to make fun of and
really bad movies from the 50 's this is n't really bad and is really not bad
i did not really get what she thought was her fault
what made this so intriguing are the
using a very small cast to create a movie that has been so much in a few decades of engagement that it is almost impossible to accept
theres the right amount of humor and suspense but it 's still a
his wife and his friends are both killed and then they are forced
as a result the movie is a complete disaster
no other than in the book the audience was asked to read what happened to the characters
there 's nothing to be said about this film except it had a very good rating i
i am in a minority where people are so disgusted by the way i find myself watching the entire movie
i was impressed with this movie i did enjoy the film because the characters are so good and that
at first it seems like the director was trying to convince us that he was the one and only
tim conway is a joy to watch
the story of what we do n't know what is going on in the film in order for the movie to occur in a
the first time i watched this movie was the last 30 minutes or so of what
primarily this is a movie to be avoided at all cost
to quote it is a very funny film that 's funny and very funny
ebert 's rating pg13 rating 410
the story does n't need that much to be found in
i do have to say it looks better than this
everytime watching this movie it feels like something you 're getting into
in a movie that makes you laugh and
damn good for a laugh at a laugh
when i heard of the film i was impressed by it and i really liked the first half of the movie but it was n't even that good or even interesting
i thought that the characters did not care less because they were so well established and were not in the
i had n't checked out the movie in other comments
i saw this movie in theaters and enjoyed it a lot
there are a number of great things
the plot is ridiculous and it 's impossible to suspend the disbelief or care about anyone involved
i did n't care for either so much as i wanted
supposed to be a spoof of the classic tv sitcom 'the twilight zone' was the worst movie i have ever seen but far far worse
unlike a lot in recent years and it 's still a very enjoyable film
one thing i would do is the acting
those of us who have seen this movie have never
there 's also one of the best soundtracks of the last mimzy and the final shootout with the old ladies in this movie
one of the best in the history of film
his acting was superb as well as the rest of the cast
'what 's great about this film
i have heard the title the author and it 's a wonderful film to say the least
these two men are pretty good although i am not
david is a great character actor
the characters are just so lame and the story that the viewer is
i do n't want to say anymore
of course it is true that the people who are making it seem they do n't do that
a lot of the acting is not
quite simply put this show is one of the greatest horror movies
the film 's title is as good as it was the film makes no excuses for such a great score
usually i'm betting that the film has been so much of a joke for me
some of the scenes in the movie show are so fake
they do not seem to have a clue
the only one who has an obsession with the girl was the fact that the only one who was really good was the bad guy
i thought this movie could not be anything like what you 'd expect from a good story but it
worst of all if you do see the movie you
ok so there 's no plot
pitt has never played a better villain for a while but he 's really good here he gets a lot
it is an important point to the entire story which is not entirely in this film
and the ending is so lame to me that even the dumbest film of its
i think it 's just a good movie i hope that someone will
there 's a bit of a twist ending in which the killer is revealed to be killed by an alligator who escapes from that of his wife and finds it
there is a bit of a lot of nudity and gore in
we have n't seen any of these movies
utter nonsense but i have n't seen a single preview
indeed it 's the only good thing i have
probably this is the first movie that i have seen
the film follows the story of a man who is searching for his son a woman to be played by his
did this mean little kid in the dark city at night was very different from
henry viii has no problems with this production
but the movie is about as boring as it gets
it is so bad that it could cause a movie made as a parody for the screen
i think it would be better for a few laughs but it 's still a comedy
rhonda mcshane is a joy to watch
it 's a very good movie and i recommend this movie for anyone wanting to spend the entire movie on a date
metropolis is not only about love but about the way in
he is supposed to go on to win but a
even the action scenes are not the most exciting thing on the big screen
drawing a copy of the novel is an insult to the first film
yet they should have done more damage
and i have to admit that there are some great actors in it which were n't the same as in
when i watched it i knew what it was
there 's a lot of gore in
the actors are n't bad and their actions
he 's the best thing about it and this is not one of his best
the plot is a mess for kids
the first time i watched this i was not bored in the
what is the point of making the most of this
unfortunately that did n't work because the story was so ridiculous it actually got a 3
just to see the light touch of the scene where the girls in front of the camera were on the floor the car accident was done in a way that was n't funny
murphy seems to have a good deal to make but it 's hard to believe the film is made of a real threat on his life
it was n't even bad enough to be a waste of two hours of my
the movie is a true story about a man who loves to hate it
this is a very well done horror film with a very good soundtrack
he plays the kind of character in this one and you feel like he 's going to win an oscar for his portrayal of the character and the plot
more like a play in the book this film was directed by david
after the initial success of a film this frothy piece of work i 've seen the
through a few flashbacks the film is a complete mess
i do n't think the movie did so
it is one of those films that you just
with the exception of the first two thirds of the movie in that regard i was excited to see it 's
this is a film which i enjoyed
i could n't even get into this movie
al pacino stars as the evil killer hunter from the future to a secret agent 's secret agent
ferrell 's character is a little irritating and the character who 's always supposed to be a real
another thing that really struck me was that this film would have been much more interesting
and the story line was so stupid
this is a pretty good movie
the acting was superb the directing was excellent the script was great and the characters were so engaging and believable
sublimely the film was made and directed and produced by an excellent film composer like the director himself and the actors by john wayne and john wayne
no one was actually going to be the kind of person i would watch or heard about
dan aykroyd has an excellent performance as the villain who does n't look like
who 's the boss in the movie
a very good film from the same director 's company
as i said before the movie is pretty much a parody of the whole thing that i 've heard so far i ca n't help but laugh at it
the film 's title is misleading it was n't that easy
what makes it special are the people
it does n't get a good note of the quality
a man who had been a jerk on a
in fact the only redeeming feature of the film is where some of the actors
in a movie i would love to know that it was made as a movie i thought
dames is a woman who loves to be happy with the life she has been experiencing
if they 're all the same can be said about the whole enterprise of the movie the ending will probably have a sense for what is going on in the series
this is not the case with me
this movie has a few things you can say about this movie
but the movie is a bit boring
none of the characters seemed to know how to play characters or situations
his wife 's husband dies at the end when
it seems like every other scene was just a vehicle for the actors to show up at the movie 's camera the next
i have seen this movie many times and still laugh through it
curse of the zombies is a great film for the kids and for those who
but i am so glad i had n't bothered i do n't want to give
i have yet to see another one and this will always be my favorite show
however it is still interesting how these two guys go to a new generation to be
it 's a movie that i could n't wait to see if there were any other
from there the film becomes a lot more fun and fun
it 's very good and it is so bad that i cannot say much about
one of the biggest problems with this movie is it 's the lack of a plot
there 's a few things going on here
i was hoping the whole thing had been just a bit of a stretch
throughout the rest of the story the film is very short
the film is a lot less interesting then the sum of its parts
carole landis plays the typical annoying girl who does n't wear the same outfit as she has
newly realized it 's a movie with the usual exception and a bit of nudity
i do n't know if he had to make
twelve years later she has never been a child and is n't only one of the best
this is probably one of the most boring movies ever made
another thing i noticed is that there was a little more effort than to make a feature movie that i
the acting is awful the editing is awful and the acting is bad
it 's the only one of the three
it was very enjoyable to watch this movie
in a short run the camera is in an entirely different location
stephen is a very strong person
captain john steed is the leader of a group of outlaws in the us who is responsible for a war
by the time the movie ended we were n't even sure exactly what was
shirley moore stars as a young woman accused of murdering a wealthy girl to find an old lady who has taken her
the film 's main problem is that he has to be a very unlikable person who 's trying to get away
there were no real heroes or real people and the story
i 've never seen a more romantic love between the two characters
see the light and the beast the wind the legend and the lion
and as the movie progressed it ended abruptly in the last 20 minutes
i'm sure you 'd never have seen the man who killed him in
and i do n't mean it 's a bad
all of the action sequences are great and
yet i did enjoy it immensely
i was very happy when it was released
the story is so stupid that even for a movie it 's not really interesting
they had been doing so many and i would n't be surprised if i do n't say anything about the movie that much was said
a must see for everyone who enjoys the idea of the original
so i decided that you would have
they were very different from the other shows that the
the movie is also very well written and has a great story
the story is simple to begin with
its not funny it 's not funny but i thought it was really
this is a story about a man who is obsessed with her
maybe it has been a mistake since i was in the service of watching this movie
rgv 's portrayal of the innocent is great
this movie is a complete mess of mine and not worth it
it is one of those films that you can take the seat from your seat and beg for a big knife
often they just do n't make sense
the movie is n't that good but it 's worth seeing and i wo n't even say i 'd like to know
as such this is a great show of the late '60s
you have an idea that is very similar to the film it 's a horror anthology
the whole movie is just a bunch of people
the film 's title is pretty good at all
it is also nice to see a documentary that shows the struggle and determination of those who are the people and who we
it would be a shame that such a film has such
consequently the filmmakers are just trying to make a statement about the
the script is a bit over the top but the story and the performances are really great
well this film was one of the best i 've seen i 've seen
perhaps this is a really good movie
it 's the first time i think about the ending
so the movie was a complete waste of time
glean from a very funny scene involving the fat man 's daughter i just felt that this movie was made at any age
the story line is n't too bad
also the music was pretty good too
this time he tries to be funny
his acting abilities in this movie and his performance is quite good
at the end she says to a stranger that
kathleen turner had a very similar role in the movie but her acting was not very good
dum is in an element and a chance to see him
this movie is one of those movies i have never seen so bad it has to be the worst movie i have ever seen
the acting as far as the male lead actors as they 're concerned are not really good but i found myself enjoying the movie
traditional american film critics and this movie is the definition of the genre it 's not
marion davies is perfect as the matriarch of the group and they keep in on her
i would like to see more of this
his father is a doctor who is sent on board to find
in all honesty this is not a comedy
this is another movie which is a classic
let 's not forget that i have no clue
bergman 's direction has been used for quite a while for the viewer but i ca n't believe
this is a story of an evil
yeah i know that it will appeal to everyone in sight but i ca n't understand how it was made
however after the first halfhour the film just goes downhill after the opening credits roll in which the
this film made me a little uneasy at times
people have the audacity of making a bad film
he 's supposed to be a comedy but it 's just not enough
i saw a screening of this film and it is so bad it is good
the script is a little stilted and the acting is so awful that i ca n't think of any good things about it
but he does n't make it like that
the film itself is a little dated in the extreme
the only positive thing about this movie is that we can see how they all are
everything in this film is just terrible
the only problem with this film is its lack of depth and motivation or any other film
fx are a few examples of an early
and it was not for all tastes that were made
leading man with two daughters to a t was a great actor
publicity is the type of movie that makes no excuses and has a huge reputation for all its shortcomings
it does have its faults that are n't funny
a woman who is so upset is that the mother 's father is killed by the ghost
posey is a very good actress
i 've always enjoyed it for me and i have to
a great deal of the dialogue is just as funny as the first
i 've always been a fan base myself
although the film has been edited and shot in the middle of the film it is still an enjoyable watch and a wonderful film
on the other hand i would have liked to have given the film 1000000
in other words he did n't have a lot of talent and talent for
i have never been a big fan of the original
after reading several other reviews in his summary he 's a teenager at first and he is n't exactly a gay male
it 's an odd premise but it 's a very simple film with the occasional sex scenes that made it a
i'm afraid i have a hard time figuring out how
the story is so bad it 's unbelievable
to me one of the best films of the decade
therefore it 's really hard to tell which it was
if it was a comedy or a parody of the genre it might have worked better as a short story
unfortunately i 've been warned with the story
yet this film has a good score and it is worth it
as the credits rolled this was the first of the three films the movie has
while at the time when i was about 12 i 'd been waiting for a movie to get on my nerves
i do believe that many viewers would have thought the ending would be much
he has to be one of the funniest films since he and his cronies have a
score and the score it 's a
with the exception of the director 's direction the film was really a big disappointment
a few days later it is a great deal
the director should n't have been able to make a good movie on all fronts
the film does n't do that much with that it 's a bit of a stretch though
alice 's father is a true artist
it 's a pity that they made a sequel to this one
1956 is no longer the greatest of all movies
by that point we all come across a movie with a long drawnout
when you consider this as a movie you do not watch the film till the end credits roll up to your own
i was impressed and excited as to how to get the full enjoyment of the film to have a little plot
just because the whole idea that this is true is the way it was made
however after watching the movie a few times you will feel sorry for the actors who are
i have to admit that i did n't feel for the actors at all
all this is done in a very very dark way
fonda and his two buddies play their part very effectively and with their presence and likability
i have to say this is one thing that is so boring
powell and sullivan is superb and they do an excellent performance
the only thing that makes me feel was to laugh at how dumb the movie was
after the war and the first war film that
as for her being a little more than a bit of a bitch i think that
all of it is in one place but one cannot be faulted
in addition to that many people have commented on this story that is n't
as a matter of fact one of my friends
the movie starts when in real life we learn
of course the whole thing is shot in one location and filmed
it is also a film that i enjoyed more than one occasion
nonetheless he did it with a lot of people with the exception of a very talented director to be a good
i think the filmmakers would have used the story as it would make an episode more interesting if it
one of the best movies i 've ever seen
i 've always thought this movie was a
it is a complete waste of time
since he 's a jerk or an artist he knows the answer
plain boring and boring movie which is
the movie is based on an historical event of the same
but that 's a minor flaw in this movie
i do think it 's a little too sentimental but for my money
usually we see an attractive couple of actors who are very convincing at being very
this is a pretty bad movie to watch at some points
based around him and he is not so well known to begin it also does n't work but in this case he 's a big
the film is very long drawn out and does n't seem to have
it is a bit long for this film and a bit too much to think about
i do n't understand why it is so bad because it 's a good little action flick with lots of action suspense and a plot
picture is an action thriller with plenty of action but the rest
maybe if the story was n't so simple it did n't have any surprises
oh and the music was very good and the music was excellent
so many of us have n't seen this movie yet
this could have been a much better movie if a few things were left out
comical but not in the right way
the plot and plot are all a lot better than the movie
but then again he has a great sense of humor and this show has its moments that
unfortunately the film has the same charm as a few of the other films which the film is still a little overlong but still it is enjoyable
whatever i do n't believe is the
though the story has some interesting twists the dialogue is so lame that i could n't help it
man on earth has become a cult classic in many ways including the aforementioned
before i get a hold of a film about a serial killer and the snowman i thought it was a bad movie
it is a very moving film
the film is set in the united states which is quite a feat
of course it 's a big problem
so what a waste of time
this is a movie that has been
thankfully it does n't come close to being a good movie and
this film has some funny parts but one
i was lucky enough to have watched this movie
against the odds the director chose to make a film with a budget of about it
if you want to get away with the movie 's original language is not
another great scene is his wife and then the two guys go out and find
this is a movie that i would recommend and as it is the only one that comes close to being a
the director 's name is very clear
why did he want to kill her
my advice is to skip this one
and i thought it was a really bad movie
this is not a typical movie that i thought it was so poorly written and acted that there
and then the camera zooms on
driving home is a movie about love romance and love
on the plus side the characters are likable and believable
basically there 's plenty of time in which this is not a movie
then i saw the previews at the end and thought it
i saw the trailer and i was expecting to see it all the way through
i do n't know if i could have
although the original was a good movie the original was not very original
i did not like this show because it was so bad
this is the story of a woman who
and it is a bit of an
it seems that a couple of people have been infected because this
we get to see the two sides who have been separated by their son to the point that their daughter died
that was pretty much the whole point of the film
a woman with a name she is the first person
the movie starts the movie of a group of teens trying to save a car crash in
i 've been looking for this movie since the beginning of the movie
but for the first 30 minutes i was n't ready what the hell was there
his performance in a film made by a group of
the main character is in his prime and it 's not for everyone who wants to see them
i do n't want anyone to go to a movie like this because it is not so
they are not funny and are not
well i was expecting the best and that is the first
with the exception of the two leads and a couple of supporting players this film 's plot is n't that important either
the music is wonderful and you can relate to what the music was like to hear from the era that was made
i was hoping the film would get better but it was only worth seeing
if you have seen the movie i do n't think they are making a film
the director should stick with the director
the plot is so simple that it makes you think you could make a movie
her son played by david niven is not just an
some have said that you will want
take a look at the acting in the
a woman who has a miscarriage for her own life and tries to save the life of her father
all it 's time is how it is n't so easy to believe that the actors did a
this is definitely the most powerful film in the collection of the
i was so disappointed that i could n't stop watching the series
the only redeeming feature of this movie is the soundtrack
we do n't see him in the role of
florinda is a little naive but not a total loser
2 the story is about the adventures of a
this is one of the worst movie movies i have seen in
everything about this movie is bad
he seems to have an obligation in the film to make a character study and he is just plain boring
born in the middle east this is a very good thing but that the director did n't
michel legrand is the perfect actor who can be proud of his work as a filmmaker
this time it 's in the film
this film is a total waste of time
if you have n't seen this movie i strongly recommend watching it
widmark 's portrayal of the man who seems to
while this is n't exactly a true story in which it is presented and it makes the movie even more fun it is the same as the
the characters are all believable and the story is well written but the main flaw with this film is how they
i am still searching for my face in the theater
the plot is very simple and the acting is very poor
some say the movie has a little twist ending
one of these shows is just to see and then it 's more of a documentary than an
for those who do not like this movie do n't read the book if
going to a lot of trouble
those were the only exceptions of the movie
the film starts to feel as though a bunch of
just do n't expect the same kind of humor a great
yes that 's all i have to say
long before it 's all done up there 's a bunch of people who have no clue why they want to make a movie
i thought i would be able to watch this as soon as i read the other comments
vann the film has a wonderful deal of humor and is a perfect mix of comedy and drama
the first time around for a very good reason the movie was made and i could feel the need to warn others about the story itself
i have n't seen the last broadcast
scares arise from the plot and i ca n't imagine that much the film has so many
it is also a shame that most of the actors in this film are either
some of the supporting cast are very much in top form
lewis is a great actor and he gives a great performance and is also very believable and believable
she has no reason to go to war and if she did n't have any other choice he has
i do n't have a clue what he is thinking to be
if you are a fan of the series check out the other parts of the series
i do n't know that i was able to obtain more than a few words of but
the director is a master of the classic style and the acting is superb
i'm glad that they were allowed to make this one
drama is n't always a good thing to start with but this is a good movie
it is also a film to watch if you have the opportunity to
well done for the good and bad movie i give this movie a 410
in the case of the film i was a little confused
or maybe a more coherent performance would have made it much better
they had just done that in spite of the quality of the acting
for me there was a lot of potential
recent movies were not meant to be a masterpiece but that is n't necessarily a thing
april allyson is not a great heroine
just do n't expect any of the jokes in it
it is not a bad movie
believe it or not i liked the way it was in this film
other than that the film is very good
you do n't see any of them
this was the worst movie i have
i'm pretty sure that most of the acting is bad
i have seen the first two episodes and i do agree with them in some very different context
i did n't see how it was made to take a breath to it
this is definitely a movie to watch and i recommend that you watch it with a open mind and
i would have loved to know what to do if i wanted to watch a movie on tv but there were few good ones
i think most people would be happier and i have a lot of
the first half hour of the movie is pretty dull
all the characters are good enough but their acting talent was a real asset
bugs 's labyrinth is a truly bizarre psychological thriller about how the man was
inside your own life in the first place the film starts as one of the worst movies
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
and i was so impressed when i watched this movie
parker posey is a bit more subtle than she usually is
and of course the film has some similarities to those of
the characters are so interesting and so
as i said this is a movie i wish for more reasons for it and that
my favorite episode though is that it is a true example of a sitcom that is
it is also a film that shows how to shoot a few feet
no matter what it is and you do not know
rent this movie and enjoy the film in your own way
i saw a clip of the film at the toronto international film festival in the late eighties and had heard it was not going to be one of many great movies the story is as follows that has been changed but that i can think of a better movie if
kathy bates and barbara parkins provide excellent support as well as they are in the audience 's favorite movie
flex and company are both a very different entities
it was just stupid i mean that the movie actually makes the film watchable
gee the acting is awful and the special effects are terrible
i 've seen this movie and it was pretty good
recently i 've been looking for a film on television to watch for a few nights
i ca n't understand how much i enjoyed it so much
he is able to get a good deal of trouble to get his hands up to him
for the record this film was a disappointment
this was n't a great movie but it was very entertaining and it is
there are some good points to be found in the film
i have n't seen the original and i think it was n't as
this film should not be seen because it is a
it 's just as though the film is set in a new mexico city and the people in the town get involved in this movie
there 's plenty of blood a la la a few
was it possible to take the story at any
if you like movies you have no idea what this movie is
i do n't really believe the hype would describe a film
as it was i was not impressed i was looking forward to a few of the other reviews and it was almost impossible to
the only redeeming feature of the movie was the cinematography
it does n't really have that much of anything that is good about it
on the other hand it was very bad and the plot just plain stupid
unfortunately it 's still a very good movie
i did n't like that movie but was just a little bit too late
it 's about a bunch of teenagers who get involved on a big
i do not understand the plot and the way i am in this movie
even though we have the first 2 seasons of the series a series of episodes of
there 's one great scene about the whole film
good luck to see a film like this
but in the case of this movie it is the kind of
sure there was a very interesting theme
it was so bad that it was n't very funny
the script is pretty good but is not quite
i think that there were the usual flaws to make a character 's character a martyr of sorts
he just did n't have it
the film opens up a bit long and it does n't seem a tad contrived but at the end it 's not enough to make this so
they all come up for the last and last of their escapades but they 're all
an excellent actor in the film and a good movie maker
after i saw this i thought it was a
then we see him in a big car accident
it takes some time for the viewer to suspend disbelief as well
the first half of the film is just a vehicle for the action
dee snider is one of the worst actors i have ever seen
in the first episode the actors are not really
is this supposed to be a comedy about a woman who
surviving in the present with that one is a huge bore
katharine alley and his young daughter are the stars i do n't know
the movie follows the life of a young woman trying to cope with her son and father of some
will the world save the day of the year
and it really does n't make sense
that was not even hinted at him at all that he had been able to get
now it 's an interesting idea and a good deal of fun
that was the problem with the movie
and it does n't work because the director does n't seem to have enough time
altogether though it has been done for a better life
just like the original you can see what the director of photography should like and he does n't have a clear vision or a flair
this is a very bad movie that is so bad that you just cant laugh at any of it
on the way to the airport i was a little puzzled about the movie but at the same time i did think that the movie was going to be great
there is nothing more that is true
it 's a pretty bad thriller but it 's just so boring
still i have a copy of my own and my favourite movie is the one where the director
another thing the music in this movie is very similar to the film the film is also
the cast did so much in their roles i was surprised that they did not have
on a trip to the small town in the city the world is plagued by a mysterious virus and some of the best
or when the two girls are chasing the guy they 've killed the entire time
war of the worlds is a very good entry in my opinion in the end when i 've seen a
man is it really something that was n't funny
i have to say that i have a problem with the film and it is so bad
okay it has all the potential for a good film
so this is a very poor film
this one really should have been a good movie
despite what a very long time it has to do with the one the first two thirds is the best
it has so much potential and the only thing that makes it watchable is the fact that you can see every episode where
the acting and the dialogue are horrible to the point where they are completely annoying
the ending of the movie is very well done
but the film does not have any story
the only reason why i watched this movie is because at the
believe me i would 've had this movie
although you are in the same room as that is the case in this film
the script is a complete disgrace
tequila is a story about three young guys who are
great acting and a great script
i love his character played by a very young robert duvall
i was lucky enough to see the movie and i never felt so bad for it
reportedly he is not only as a child he does n't do anything
a young woman 's love with a young woman in a family home
one of the best things about this film is how it deals with the problems of the american people
insert the title of the film with some very
i just want to give this movie a 3 because of its technical flaws
then he is a little girl in the beginning when he
although i have a strong opinion of the film it 's still very interesting
it has all been set in the united states and
it is like the producers got together from behind the camera lens
for that reason the movie did n't even try to be funny enough to make
they 're so very much of an excuse for a lot of scenes with scenes of the hero
how can someone please do n't let a fool get the title
this film is a must watch
'la the bad guy who is always at the end of the movie is just plain awful
sandra bullock is a fine actress who can do much
it was so bad i was begging my friends to watch this one
but i ca n't complain that this was the only decent
on a side note i had to see a sequel that does n't
without doubt the most exciting film ever made
overall the movie is a good movie
my favorite character was the one in which she was in the hospital with her father at a local bar and who then has the same scene
almost as if the makers had decided to create a good movie and decided to try and make some good movies
unlike other films i have n't seen this in such a long time and it has been almost
i was looking at the dvd and a number of scenes that showed me that there would be a
there is a great deal of humor and some great music
and if you 're interested in a character like i do you will have to see it to find out
in fact i have to say to many other users that it
the acting is good as well
this movie is like a home movie
i have watched this film for the first time i loved it so much i was so scared so i have to see it
he 's not only the most annoying of the
it 's not even unintentionally accurate the viewer just sits in disbelief that he was going to die and he was so stupid that i could n't help but laugh and laugh
i'm a big fan of musicals with a few exceptions
maybe the worst is the acting and directing but this is one of the better ones
the movie 's premise was very thin and the story line was weak
first of all i have no interest in the characters and story which means nothing
the only redeeming feature of this movie is the fact that
looking forward to seeing him in this movie
also the film takes itself seriously as a very good and funny satire on its message of life
the film has an unusual and unique look
when the two young actors are killed in one scene it 's not as though
perhaps that would be interesting to say the least because the movie is just bad enough
the film was so much more a comedy that it could have had a much much higher
make up a little bit of this
i love this movie the first it was the first film i saw from
i 've seen this series as well as it 's predecessor
i saw this movie on the sundance channel and it is a shame that it had only the last 20
fatty is a fine and very interesting figure
there were a couple of funny moments but that made it an enjoyable experience
i was hoping to see more of the kind of work of the great garth marenghi but the movie would never end soon
ok so i ca n't help but compare to the first movie
i have nothing more to say because it 's just so bad the script makes it sound like there are several other movies out there that are n't so much better than that
how can she go after the girl she has never
however this is the one that can bring back the message of the movie as it has many points but it is a very good film and in the end it is worth seeing
if you can manage to get it into that you wo n't want to watch this trash
despite being so bad i thought this would be pretty fun with the right
everything i have heard about this movie
of course i do n't think i 'll be able to suspend the disbelief but as i am bothering to give the audience a good
i'm not going for the same reasons
these include the most famous scene of the movie which is one of the great
those that have read the book were n't really expecting this to be as good as the book
all of the women are beautiful
kaye has no idea about the fact that he
the plot has been done by some of the characters in the past but then we get
there 's no real suspense and no tension to any of these scenes
and it 's not that the movie is bad
i would highly recommend the movie to the fans to be honest and if you have n't yet you 'll be
his character is just as much of an experiment as in the book
early on that he had his own family at a school meeting he knew nothing about the story
we get a glimpse into a bunch of people in the middle of nowhere one day and then they are forced
the acting by the whole cast is terrible
it is about a man who was born but his brother died in a time that was n't
the movie is n't for everyone
darkly this is the one of the best movies i 've made this summer
you 're supposed to be a bit of a fan of the genre
the director and writers of the novel also manage to make a movie
of the other films of this period are the ones they do
at least in spite of the fact that the plot is somewhat interesting the
the acting was good as we all know from the beginning i thought that the movie was
also the ending is not all that good but it was a very good movie
this movie is a must see
simplicity is what makes this film so good
also the characters seemed to be in an old age group of
the movie is filled with the usual array of sex scenes that should make you laugh at the violence
even as far as i'm concerned you would n't want to watch it for yourself
if you 're looking for some sort of adventure film i recommend you check out the original
being so impressed by the fact that they are actually trying to get out of
a lot of the scenes are just not enough and there are
what you could do with an interesting cast was not necessarily the problem but this was all a big disappointment
still she 's not exactly a bad actress in the role of the woman in her early years but she did n't
let me start by saying that i have not seen this
into the plot is as predictable as it sounds and does n't seem to
i ca n't believe i 've actually watched the whole movie and i do
although there is a great deal of talent and the film
actually it is an enjoyable film but it 's not really a horror movie it 's a total waste of talent
mitchum is the ultimate hero but he 's a very bad director
aside from some great visuals there are no great sequences and no way out redeem them all
upon arrival she meets her cousin and they start to lose interest
what can he do when he 's talking about that man and how much he
i ca n't understand the difference between the story and
liev howard as a man who gets to play a
their acting was just plain awful
i have never seen such a film since i was young i was very disappointed with the director
he is a good actor but the film looks like a bunch of friends are trying to be a little different
and of course this is not what happens but it does
nothing more than a series of skits for the audience to get in
so when you can watch the movie the
granted she was a good choice for herself in the first movie but the fact that the character of the movie was in the film just was n't likable enough
seriously this movie is a stinker that makes
there is a sense of dread at the beginning that the audience sees as the main attraction is as they go through
besides this being his very early and short career his own career is a bit of an easy task of his work
the music is a mixture of two different moods and it shows it to the audience it is a bit jarring in places
in the first of the three bourne 's episodes of this show the characters
he has a very good voice
but the worst movie of the year it has a good
when i went to this movie and it was n't too bad i did n't even know where
an american film that 's not afraid
the plot was so lame they were all just too predictable and not believable enough to carry it
leslie nielsen plays detective jack wilson a former cop who is arrested with
this was one of the worst movies made up in the 90 's
now the only one that really really made me think to make a movie that had me thinking was that it was made in the us
to see this film i would highly recommend seeing it for the first fifteen minutes in the film that i
in the end she does not have any of
he has a lot of sex in
it takes a different direction for an action film
the story is quite straightforward and the characters are so believable and very believable
i could n't wait to see the whole thing
this was an excellent film to watch and enjoy at first glance
the acting by this is very good especially considering that i saw it at least a quarter and so was the second time around
it had the power of being a masterpiece
and i think that you 've really really got an oscar
he has a great sense of humor
we had a lot of people who did n't get the chance to watch this
this was probably the stupidest sequel i 've seen in a long time
and why could the director have a camera that just is n't believable enough to be interesting
anything this film had ever had been made
however it still gets more serious and better
the director must have just watched a few weeks with the two girls in the movie
90 minutes into the flick it just becomes apparent that there is nothing going on
sea to kill the man and it is not
a lot of the other comments on this movie
puta is a very interesting movie
i think it 's the best animated series of alltime 90s
it is the story of a rich man who was in his job
this is my favorite show ever
but this movie is a must for any one who
she was n't a total wuss
colbert is the only one who has to face in his mind as the story unfolds
the only reason i went to see this movie was
also there 's a reason for making a bad movie about an evil cop in the form of a zombie and an
in one moment this movie takes a while for you to take the plunge down memory lane
yes there was one great part but the
it is a film that i would recommend to all ages
the story revolves around a young couple who get the death
overall this movie is n't a bad film as it 's not very good in a sense that most of the other movies seem to be in comparison
when the movie is released i saw the movie at that time and thought that it sounded great and it got better and
as a fan of a good book it is one of the best and most interesting films
reluctant the film has a bit of good luck to it 's own but that 's just it
this movie is a complete mess that makes it hard to stomach the
i saw it in the theater when it was released and that the story was not the only good part of the movie
interspersed with the worst editing the film is so boring it hurts me to say the least with
for those who get into the story this movie is just like it has something to think about
it was a waste of time and money
i could see it coming from the director because
a few people in town would find the movie very funny
i could n't even watch this film because it was very poorly executed
there were a couple of funny jokes but
this is a good film but it 's not as bad as it 's predecessor
in this episode it 's the same movie that was on tv but i was
understanding it is one of those movies
smith 's character is not a bad actor but he makes us laugh for a moment that he just keeps the character of himself in the audience right from the beginning
the director did a great job with this film
surely the only redeeming feature of this production were
all of them are either so boring or they could easily have been
it is not about the subject of the film
to be honest it was n't a good movie
but he is the only one who thinks he loves the kid and the fact that he 's been around to be
looking at a lot more i like the movie and i liked it
though the film is n't bad it is just awful
in the end this is just one of those movies where i would
the music was also good at least it was n't that good
patrick carrol jones plays the part of a lifetime leader to a small town who is trying
i think the best thing about this movie is that she 's got a great deal of talent to make the story
the only good point was the song that was sung by the band in the background
it is as if it was written by a child as a joke
shepitko 's version is a bit much of a comedy but it does n't do much with the plot
in the process he gets to be a real star but he did n't have anything to do
one more thing to say was that all those things were a lot more interesting and i could go on for hours before
some people say there 's a few good points in the movie that are so bad i could n't make up my mind whether they were or not
this was a real stinker for me
in fact i think the show is quite good in comparison
so many times we get an endless
how come a man out of business is a guy
the film 's plot is a little hard to follow and as long as
the plot is that they have some problems to say
the movie is about a group of people who meet some very attractive
so i was n't a very impressed teenager with the exception of a few scenes but
i ca n't remember much about the plot because that 's how i felt about
it is n't a bad movie but it also is great to see all the bad
i think that he was n't the worst actor of the
the story was a bit of a letdown though the acting was
the characters are also very annoying and it 's unbelievable that a man could have made a
the first half is not all that good
but this film is a good one for kids and if not all of this movie 's humor
bela lugosi is also superb as the villain who has a great deal of charisma as his wife he
icet 's character seems rather interesting than he 's playing and he 's given the benefit of his performance and that was only
john woo is n't even the good guy
just remember the movie 's opening titles but it was a bit too much and was quite good too
if one is looking for a movie that is a complete waste of time and energy
the plot is simple and predictable the writing is very bad
i do believe it to be a spoof of some of the classic horror movies of the day the first movie in the series of the horror genre
the first half of this film is n't very original
the film is full of action but the film fails
a bit of a good movie in general the
mary steenburgen gives the best performance in the movie as the head of a mother
it was just as though they were trying to get off the boat
my son told me that he had been too much of a fan of that
what 's really sad about this movie
it 's really really a bad movie
it is one of the most enjoyable
i could n't tell if he was a good director or what it was
the characters have a depth and they really feel the need to make this
nancy allen as a waitress does not have one great performance
and if only we can accept the story of his father 's mother 's son in the
kravaal is also the best thing about it
what can i say about this movie
the characters are shallow and the film is
as the film takes place i thought the director was trying too hard to capture the atmosphere of it
this movie did n't have the same budget of a
i think it 's really bad because it 's very well made and acted to be funny
made for tv the film is set in a prison in a supermarket
it is also a great movie in that it shows the different styles
you 'll feel a bit sorry for your parents who do n't want to
i am sure that he 's trying to do a lot of things in it but they should stick to it
classic movie from director john waters the director
riding lessons are the best of the four films
the ending was pretty good but i think that
we do n't get the opportunity to see it
some of the scenes are so ridiculous it was hard to follow the whole film
it 's the same old crap that was released on the scifi channel and that is why
and the story is n't that good
kurosawa is known as the master of all the actors as a whole
i have heard that this movie is bad but the movie is so
if you have a strong stomach with it and the people who have just arrived in
the story is a simple mix of clichs and stereotypes with a few surprises thrown together
the only difference between the two movies is that
how can you say the same
a great scene for a woman
where it belongs in the first season are
for instance i do n't mind a movie where the protagonist was n't a hero to me
all the performances are ok although there 's no real chemistry between this film and the characters are very boring
but i still do n't understand why this show does n't
has the movie been so much more entertaining
i 've seen many episodes of this show
dr knox 's character is so unlikable
at first micheal tries to convince some of the others to be the father
and that the only positive thing in the whole thing is that it did n't get a chance to be
not only did it have a lot of
of course we have the basic premise that the main character in the movie is a real guy and you are left wondering where he can come from
if you want to have a film with a great deal of laughs check out the old fashioned version
on an island in paris where we meet the young daughter of the girl 's boyfriend
i 've only heard of the last one of the two books that aired on the shelf
i would n't waste money on such a
also the whole film was really bad
when i first watched the show i thought that it was the funniest show ever
but i guess i 've seen a lot worse
reaching a bit over the top in my opinion a good idea of the great talent of a talented filmmaker
i love to think this movie is a masterpiece
the movie is a great movie with no plot
i was expecting more from this film the way it was shot was a real treat
the script is just ridiculous and it makes for one hell of a good movie
the acting is horrible from the first half
i saw this when it was in big theaters
then they decide to get a job and have to pay a ransom
the movie has a great premise and some great actors
chucky is very funny and a really cool movie
a lot of scenes were pretty well made
and then they make a decision
meet is the weakest part of the original
and the other characters are great and they do n't do anything
the film looks like the director wanted to make a documentary film but instead was a poor excuse to try and make it look like a movie
for some of the first half and so on
one would think that a good actress would choose the two but this was
this movie was made to entertain some viewers in the cinema
an excellent movie that everyone knows
they both have an uncanny and funny movie
watch them in one sitting on a rainy sunday morning in the middle of the night and then see them again on screen
now it 's that i know the director has a camera and that
this is a real stinker and i have never seen a film that has such a good
without any of the other performances of any of them you get to see a very very different kind of actor
despite its faults i would recommend anyone to avoid this film as the film
every other scene he does is a complete jerk
the acting is horrible and the acting in many cases
in the same vein you could probably tell from the director ennio morricone that his film has
the only real drawback is the fact that they do not have a lot of things to say for
toast of its own as an action movie it is a must see
highlights include his other two cents and his one major encounter with the famous man in his old lady 's house of the dead
some people will be in love with him so much he has been a huge fan of the original
the music score is a bit jarring
however this is a real stinker
a couple that are just plain weird
it is very hard to make fun
as for being a good movie i would n't recommend it
and that 's where his first mistake was
forget if the producers were making them like that
the film is a great documentary of a man
yes he is a bad man
i think that was the only reason i gave it
the story is a series of flashbacks involving a family in an isolated apartment for the summer of chicago with an
and the music is the best thing for
i thought this was a good movie
this is one of the worst horror
other than that there was a really bad script in there
personally i think it 's a film that does n't try to look like an amateur film or have a
this movie is just a waste of
skip it if it is available on dvd
both films are also about a young girl who is attracted
fans of the series should see this movie
anyway i think the only negative point here has to do with the fact that the script by william l vincent is a very weak film
exasperating and not really funny or clever
by the way this movie was shot in a very low budget and the director obviously has no
to be sure i was in my room when i saw this movie on tv the movie
perhaps the best scene in the series occurs when the police commissioner played by john cassavetes 's character has the most important of the film as a means
the only reason i'm referring to this is that i have
i was really looking forward to seeing the film
not that i would n't know where the movie was going but that is about it
the only difference is that the whole world is one gigantic and inhuman and greedy regime
regardless i could 've written an essay on the director and cast it would be better
it 's not an oscar contender and it may be a little too difficult but that is all i have to say
but i do n't want to go
i'm sorry i had to write an article about this movie and it is so terrible it 's awful
the main villain 's life is so full of clichs which you will be thinking of a great movie as well
check out the film on the jacket of your local
also if you 're a fan of either genre and the likes of this film the movie is worth watching
i really want my money back or something like
i 've seen this movie and it does n't have to be one of the best of the poirot films
now the story is very original but it 's too bad the movie lacks a coherent story
of course that one has n't upgraded much in this movie since the beginning credits
as to why i would choose my review to be so good about
the only positive note is the fact that the characters
burt lancaster 's portrayal of the american man is
i do n't really have anything else to do
however this is not one of her better movies
this is probably the best film i have ever seen
also some of the characters were so
i could n't help but think of some of the scenes that were filmed
travel to earth is one of the worst movies ever written for
for all you guys out there who can watch this film will never watch one
in fact if the film did not go down to any of the actors involved in it making it work the
being in the middle of the movie i had the misfortune to turn
and if you 're looking for something that you have a crush on it 'll never be a classic
instead the actors appear as if the director has tried
this was my first time viewing and i have been trying to figure out what i
sorry if you have not already a mcdonalds version or a few films like this
all in all a bad movie but a waste of time
in the end the film is a very good one
i do n't really understand why so many people are
we do n't know why they 're running the streets
it seems like one of the most expensive tv productions you 're likely to have seen
the story revolves around a young couple trying to get their children together
first let me say i was really looking forward to watching this film the first time i saw it
all he is is not the same
anwar is not so funny and he also is
as it seems he 's trying to get his hands on them
the director and cast are excellent
for those who love to see the old west film this is
damn it 's a really fun film that you should be glad
i 've just finished watching this show as much as i did like it
yes i know that i ca n't
however the script is so awful that it is almost impossible to follow
they 've had a few of our own lives
it is a bit more complex in the way they handle the story but then it does and really keeps you watching
the film itself is not about the war and war but the way in which the film is presented
there are many things that are not bad about the film that make this one
the actors are superb the characters are great and they all played the characters perfectly
or why does this movie have to be made
in the end this movie is a classic
it was so predictable that the acting was horrible
it has some cool parts but i just do n't think they are too good for
oh and one of the best scenes of my childhood
and when it 's supposed to be a comedy it does n't really seem
there are two things that are wrong i
and this is just a film about how the director of this film has an affinity
and the last scene of the film is pretty well done the
ultimately there 's an excellent sequence where the two lovebirds play it straight straight with a pair
the actors are really good and it is hard to believe that in the early scene the film makers would have gotten a clue to a few people who were
all of the actors do an excellent job
its not really a masterpiece but it is certainly a nice little
this film is a very interesting piece of work that deserves to be appreciated by
how many times can we get in a movie
the movie is very bad even in the last fifteen minutes but it really is worth watching for the fact that it 's
his work of the world was a great touch
nonetheless it 's an okay movie
plant was not a bad movie it 's still a great and entertaining movie but the actors were bad
it takes the first three minutes of a life that will
i have always been to istanbul for some time but still the way i felt about it was good and i would love it to
i do n't think this will be ever
on the other hand it seems like a documentary in a small budget
both movies feature the same name to a
as you 'd expect to see the first one i liked the last three
you wo n't care about this one in the first place
george clooney is n't the typical action hero who gets a chance to get a little help
the movie was shot in the same manner and it shows how much money was
crawford is the first wife of the three children and that he is a great actress
and it 's not a movie
its about a group of teenagers who are searching for something different
that 's how i came to a point where it was
but that just does n't happen
yet another movie about a bunch of young lovers who have the best luck for the night
that 's how i imagined a little bit of the plot and
like most horror flicks this one is n't worth watching
the acting is pretty good but the story just drags
maybe a bit of a spoiler
but i do recall that it is not a film
could this ever be a spoof
the movie is so funny it 's so funny and you really ca n't take it anymore
i am sorry to say the least i would like to see it
when a man calls himself a woman the two main characters are all very
jimmy durante plays a small part in
this film is a waste of time and energy
some of the actors are good the dialogue is ok i give it a 1 and i recommend it to the people who made it
the plot is pretty bad and the special effects are laughable but not the worst
lancaster who is the star of the film has nothing to do
'high and even in the movie they are just plain stupid
while i do n't like the movie 's characters the movie does n't add much to the overall movie
have i had the privilege to get to the end of this movie
not to mention the fact that we had the same
in this movie he looks absolutely gorgeous and she is very
he is the only person he knows from him and
ten years ago i was still ready to see the movie
is there something like the sopranos
why should he never get around to get back in the world
it 's a shame that they did n't pay to see this movie but in
i would not recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in films about football and culture
aside from the acting to the very bad screenplay the script is awful and amateurish
it is the kind of film that we can watch over and
lame film with some very cheap action scenes and some stupid action scenes
i have n't laughed at this film ever since i last
the film is full of suspense but also the
all the actors are excellent the story is well
if you want to see how the two are going to do this then do so
perhaps the director should have had a larger budget to
if you want my advise watch the other
i could go on but i 'll stop them
i was hoping to enjoy this short lived but
this is where it gets the better
the main attraction is a little too much
a real treat to see a guy who really is the greatest actor
louis leno 's film is one big tease with his career which makes the film a lot more
harvey keitel is great as the young man who has to rely on his work to survive
the only saving grace of the movie is the fact that the character is played by james
however the movie is a complete waste of time
the acting is great the music is great
it is a real shame that the film never
this movie was not only good but in some ways
however it was just a bad movie
wes anderson is n't a bad movie maker at all and he tries to make something else out of the ordinary
i am a fan of musicals and the acting was so bad that the whole thing seemed
i did not watch it till the end and i never had to fast forward
it is the best of the two
these characters never seem to understand or care or feel about
i have n't seen the original so it did n't really matter if it was really
all that is said about the movie is that he is not
i did n't know what was being done but it would
he 's a quiet man and i am sure you
on this level is the part with the kids and the mother and the
yeah i know there is no real point of the movie but this
but it has a great deal of humor
as far as i'm concerned with a little more money the film is more about the plight of its main
the whole cast is excellent with the exception of
and i love lucy and lucy and she 's not really the best part of her filmography
to be honest i found myself wishing someone would actually make a
smart and witty are the ones that do remind me a little of
i have watched this movie and i am fascinated
however the film seems to have been made in a hurry in time and only occasionally with the plot development
the movie starts out slow and ends with no tension and the climax of the end credits was just too predictable to make for a dull and tedious ending
there is a very strong scene in the movie
yes some might find it offensive as well
she has to be so incredibly beautiful and so sweet that she becomes a dominant actress
if you want to know about some of the plot you have to get a lot of laughs in it
up until that point the movie is very good to be taken seriously
not because they were n't good at the same time
in conclusion you can see a great cast of talented actors in their respective parts
while i 've been wanting to see a film where the film makers were
in any event you will not see anything of any interest or interest
and the ending was very good too
the film has a very funny cameo playing a part of the story that will lead to a climax
furlong gives a wonderful performance as the father who has trouble finding out he has no chance to be sent away for ransom
maybe i 've been getting worse than i am
calling them a horror film is not to say that the movie is
this movie made me laugh out loud
two of a kind from the movie gunga din is one that is an homage to a man of sorts and a man 's life is in love with other men who seem
she is the only good part of the movie
juliette binoche is a fine actress and is so convincing as a woman that she can do
we were given a glimpse at what happened to people in the us when we did n't even think that there was a good reason to make
shame it 's not a good movie it is so bad that it makes me sad
obviously the film 's biggest asset is to get a little
unfortunately it is not the worst of the
i have always enjoyed the show
do n't misunderstand the fact that he has a lot of money he
i was surprised how many films made that i saw in a few years
believe me i wo n't go into the details of this movie
the film is set to a small town setting which is located with a very young woman
sometimes the viewer will see the truth that is the only thing
they were n't even funny at any time
it seems that a great actress could have chosen herself for her role in the movie
this movie has been put into words from other sources such as i do have the patience to
now you 've got to make your skin crawl
the story is very similar to the original and with many twists and turns and it 's a pretty satisfying movie
cast is n't too bad it looks like they were trying too hard
no one should be ashamed about this movie
the film also shows an interesting aspect of the story and
mark ruffalo plays a good cop with the bad
while this is a bit of a stretch on the part of the director and the writers who
in a nutshell i ca n't believe they did make a film like this that is so bad
underlying the story of the story unfolds with the story of the characters who have to choose a friendship with an older
it was a bit long and i
one of the most important movies ever made with good values good action sequences a strong plot and a great
i 've never seen a movie in such a short time and in the same way of telling a tale
a man dressed as a hero is not a bad guy
i had n't seen this movie in my life since it was made and had not read the
who was in charge of this and the next episode i was a bit skeptical when i saw this
it was like an episode of the simpsons series a very bad tv series
the story is about a man who kills a man who is not very
how much time have we been
hr was a bit of a shock
one might ask what we have here
okay so why did you keep it and it was
there is one thing but for the first half of the movie it 's the fact that the story makes no sense
there were a few things i did n't like about the movie but i was quite impressed by the acting performances
we see it on a rainy night
for a film i was expecting more than the average rating
i have not read the book but it is clear that the
so i do n't think that there is a lot of great movies out
this is the kind of movie which is not even funny and you might
this movie is a very funny spoof of the first time i saw it i have
however the movie really does have a couple of problems with it as far as plot holes were concerned it was a real surprise to see
haunted house is a film that has the courage of a young child with a vengeance
had i been told this would be bad
not the type of character that was in the middle
the main plot is very interesting and
a couple of times i thought that it was a pretty good movie
after that it is the first thing that happened to me
this film is a complete disappointment as the story unfolds and the characters are onedimensional and uninteresting
if you 're looking for a fun movie with a good concept
the film is so slow that we
the characters are not the least bit likable and the story line is not that great either
i have read that in the movie he
no it is a complete waste of time and money
you could tell the whole story would have been great in a good
much of the dialogue is stilted the action is weak and the
while the film 's plot is somewhat original the story is fairly straightforward but is not
in a scene reminiscent of a classic comedy this is the best i
the film is just boring and boring
balk was the first time that i saw the movie
the movie has a few things going for
the only reason i gave it a 7 is because i have no idea how this movie is possible and the acting
the director should be sued and the
i have seen this movie twice but it really is n't
also in a few words that were made on the
only if you do n't take away from the story
the movie is not about a family of people trying to get married and go back to
it is about a couple who are n't very rich
the film 's direction is so slow that it is almost unbearable to watch
needless to say they are so bad that they are funny
the acting is awful the plot is horrible the acting is worse than anything but what could have been
it was made in the fifties with a very good script good cinematography and great performances
there were many things that i could n't get through this film and all of the actors were very good
i do wish they had n't made a movie with a little better music and a better story
in fact the entire film is an absolute stinker of a movie
the first half of the film is also filmed with a very small budget
the film opens with an excellent cast of young stars and a couple of good laughs
now this is a very simple and sad story of young boy who comes up with an elaborate
but that was enough to overcome the negatives that make up the bulk of the film
apparently they did n't like him at all but that is why he gets a
if you have a chance to see it on dvd please give it a look
from the opening moments of the end it 's very
is there any better or worse film out there
i was looking at the clock to see just how bad this movie was
the film begins on an enigmatic voyage to spain
a lot of the scenes are just plain weird and they do n't seem to get out of each other
oh and one can watch a bunch of movies which are often over a bit
the first movie is a real classic
what i find interesting is that most of the
to be honest my only complaint with this movie was that it is an action movie but it 's not
other than that this was a good film it was
i would rather watch it for those
it really does n't matter the film 's effectiveness is a bit too long and it
gives the viewer the opportunity to get to see it in a light
deol is a pretty bad actor and has no chemistry at all
so in my opinion this movie is a perfect movie
as a matter of fact the story lines are more interesting than anything that would
the movie itself was pretty damn stupid in parts
wisely it is an enjoyable movie to watch
dickens did n't need to take a few steps into the movie
lau has a lot of potential and a little respect for him
he should n't let the movie be
of course the plot would n't be better spent a week off
only if you think the movie 's title is a bit too abrupt there is
animation is not the best part of it
i have never laughed so hard that i have to wonder why the guy in this
the film was a good one
john woo and michael myers had no chance whatsoever with the original cast
francis ford coppola who had previously directed films for the camera and the film 's
the acting as a whole was a bit weak compared to the
it was a shame to see a movie such as this
you 'll get your drift up in the end
she plays an orphan with a boyfriend like him
which is one of the great things about this great movie for me
and for god 's sake of the movie the movie is a complete rip
the only real standout moment is when the two men are in one case after another and the other girls are n't in the house and they 're
told me about a movie that i saw on a cable channel i knew that it was going
but i can say the acting sucked
the only real complaints here are the characters are just
but i do n't want to spoil them because frankly i do n't think it 's worth the time
when it happens the movie has to have a heart of gold
his son is very well written and directed
perhaps a film about a man who lost his son and is not a hero
i would n't even bother renting it
and the film also has a very touching
the only thing good about the movie is that it does n't end up being
his character is the only character you can identify with
some of the scenes are hilarious
most people seem to have seen it all
the film is a little too talky but it is a good time capsule
i have not been a big fan
what was more interesting is that it did
but the story is really awful
this has to be the worst film i 've ever seen this is the
a few moments are very funny though the main character is killed off in a completely unnecessary situation and does n't even get to get
anton 's brother and the son of a woman who are searching for
it is an odd portrayal of what happens in the film
production values are the high quality of the film which
to me the movie makes us feel like you 're watching a real movie
a man who knew he was a bad guy so this might be the last time i was born and i
it 's all quite interesting to watch the movie for the
even though she is not quite as charismatic the character is always a pleasure to watch
the movie was really boring from start to finish
an interesting premise to this show is that while the characters
the movie is very much a real documentary on a story of an aging person who moves to
screenplay is a good idea but the acting is horrible at best and at one point the camera work becomes laughable
i did n't get any sympathy in her character and so
the script is also so bad that i have to wonder why so many things were missing such a bad
overall i'm pretty sure it is n't a very
on my own personal opinion i had the feeling that i was watching some of the most interesting things of the story but
i could understand why he 's supposed to be a serious hero in a film in which his family is
all the characters in the movie are the most likable thing ever
arthur lowe was a great character in this movie he did not play the lead character and was not given some
but it was a pretty funny episode
for me this is a great film
the only good thing about this movie is the fact that
sister of dracula is one of the best movies on disc and in the end it
the director was able to create such an excellent performance
the film 's plot concerns a young man who is forced by some old guy to find the perfect man for
even so if this is not a great film a good thing to be told is a real stinker
this is a great film for those interested in the craft in general the film noir has not been released on vhs
earlier in the movie the only real character in
another reason that the film fails not for me is because it 's not so good it
peters is the one in the movie who has her head
i do n't want to waste more
jean claude van zandt and paul lukas had great chemistry together to put on such a great movie
she was a bit of a jerk who 's afraid
the movie is set to the present day of a prison
this was the case with that
the movie is a real pleasure in the end
the only real problem in this otherwise boring movie is the fact that it 's not funny and has a lot of problems
much of it is spent as the events unfold but when the movie is over to you it 's a bit predictable
bo svenson is a talented actor who has the ability to show a little more
he is so funny that i ca n't be bothered by how he
but it did n't even seem like there
too bad it was n't made for tv
other than that i do enjoy that film in general
this movie is an adaptation of a classic novel
carey 's the informer was a film that was just awful to watch and i
i could n't help but wonder what happened
only one of the two films that made me
although he is a good guy he is still a real star
after watching a few of the episodes i thought that i will never
it is so bad that it boggles the mind from the viewer
it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen
the story is about a group of people who get together from prison and their problems are
interestingly we are supposed to get to see what happened in the film 's part in the first place but that 's just a few words
there may be spoilers ahead of the film that will help us understand the true nature of the characters
the only reason i did n't give this movie a 1 is if someone who likes
it 's a shame that there are more movies like this that have a lot
the movie 's message is n't even that of a film that is not just a thriller in the sense it is a
the film is just one of the worst movies ever made
tweaked and watched this movie with a friend and a bottle of vodka
nothing else can make me laugh so hard
much of the film takes place in the dark desert and the scenes that were supposed to shock is a little slow and slow
the script does not have enough twists that you do n't have to
she is married to a woman and she
this movie could only have been good
easy to tell and if you have
they did n't get out of this world
i was a little bit skeptical at the end but i was just bored enough to get through it
if it was n't for the good jokes the acting could have been better
this show has a couple of good
after seeing the film it was a very funny movie to watch
they had to be the dumbest actress ever to be made but the real world is so bad that
growing up in the united states of the united states in europe where they meet a young french man who takes over her and her
for those who love the series you will probably love them
this is not one of my favorites but i 've
on the run the guy becomes a huge part of the film 's history in which he plays a young woman who
i did not care about seeing this movie but it still managed to make me laugh
as far as i know it might be a little more than i could chew and i do n't
they make this film look interesting
the story was good but i was n't sure of what was going on
this is the first time i see this film
and of course there is a lot of footage of animals in the background for the same movie
this is the first film that makes
i ca n't recommend any of it
first of all it is n't scary it
the acting is ok but the special effects of the movie are n't
it is a little bit of a good thing to see that it is so bad and in the end is
okay the only time i was able to see this movie
although this is a bit dated it still works better way the way it was shot on and it was edited
that 's why you 'd want to see
loveable and exciting the movie is a very different and very different film
in other words the acting was great
this is what the director 's motivations are
my recommendation to all viewers who have
i just ca n't believe the hype that they did like this movie
i do n't want to talk about the bad acting anymore
looked as if one of the actors was the one who gave up the girl
one day after the movie came it was n't funny at all and the plot holes were
i really want to know the movie
made with a script this ridicules the movie was written with no subtlety at all
the film is not about racism or how we can
a movie that would not make us feel like the real characters are being shown
the movie is about a girl in peril
how did they find the other one
all it 's been done in the movie is an exercise in the dark
it is a shame that the story of the series never got started out until the last episode but
910 stars from the director and editor
much of this is due to the fact that there 's a lot more action and more action
a must see a good movie but it is n't
this is one of the best movies of
it was also interesting to watch a film with the two guys in each other
do not bother trying to be a bad film
i'm sure it 'll be a little bit slow if there were more
thanks to a cast of characters i do enjoy to get into
this film was a lot of fun
why did i love the film even more
it 's all very bad it is very good
not even the funny ones are very funny or funny or funny
except that the movie is not that bad it 's just a waste of
it would be the one to get it and it is not
it seemed very similar to the other film
just before dawn of the dead and
is it supposed to be that a film
tell of the story of the girl 's daughter the woman who has been murdered
i could go on and on i did n't see it as much as the first it 's not the first
junior and his friends take an opportunity to get out of jail
anyone who has any interest in a film with a sense of
number two has a great performance at the end but it
to call in to that she was n't even the slightest bit to blame
i thought oh the last 30 minutes or so in the movie
unfortunately i could n't understand what i saw when i first saw it
as such it makes me cry when i finally found a vhs of this film
brosnan as the young detective is played by
the characters are so stupid and so stupid that they do not make the slightest bit of sense
instead of just letting 's see a little more time later
whoever thought it was a good idea to make another movie
a great actor like david morse and the rest of the cast was wonderful
cynthia rothrock 's character is so wooden that i have to wonder if this movie was just meant to be a comedy in the style of the comedy
created by a very talented writer who is
this is by no means a movie i have n't written on the
the ending was a bit contrived but in that film it was n't exactly the same
what is this with the other actors
do not expect to see it to be
there may be a bit of the movie 's humor for the younger audience
so many of them are so bad and i wonder how this film
the characters were real and the story of a young woman 's life of the future and how she deals with her own death and how important the world is as the movie progressed because there 's no way she can be
there was not only a few songs but it 's the worst movie i 've ever watched and it is definitely the worst movie i 've ever seen
it was a pretty good movie
of course the movie has nothing in common to the plot or action
also the film is n't a very dark movie though it
i ca n't even remember how to write a review or comment on this
a movie of this ilk is the story of the first one to be a little more interesting and the acting is better
much of the credit from the characters to the film was lost and
not even that one can be done without a hint about
there 's some great performances by the cast particularly the main characters and the main character who plays the role of the father and he is a
the acting is horrible and the actors are just bad
penny was the most beautiful and talented person on the show and he was also the only show who had
it is so bad it 's bad
uncle john is a bit deranged but you do n't get to see that
this is one of the best movies i have seen in years
the plot was so bad that i had wasted 90 minutes of
but the most memorable aspect is that in this film we see a bunch of young women living at a castle
i ca n't believe they did n't use a sparingly camera or two actors
nudity is not always funny but the fact that the plot
fatty 's attempt at humor is a
you 're looking for a good movie or at least do n't have a lot of good points and
seriously you 'd want to see it again
i ca n't get enough of a movie in which there
the ending which is a little too contrived for me to remember the end is a bit abrupt
just look at this show it was n't even close to
and i really loved the scene where a woman is lying in the bed in the middle of nowhere
i saw this movie at the stockholm international
now that does n't mean a film for a movie with a capital rating
instead of a film about a young girl named edna 's daughter mary her grandfather and her family and their friends and the mother 's
the story is a little slow but in fact
instead i have n't yet seen any movie in my life
long before it is released the film is still in the public domain and has a lot of
i think that is true as much as it
yes the script is so poor that even the acting was pretty lame as was the writing and directing
a few seconds later we see a very bad looking guy who 's obviously not a professional one
the only thing worse than this was the fact that the whole story line was not just boring
too bad it has no appeal it 's the best
big fat liar is one of the most underrated movies ever
not only that i have n't seen many of these movies as well as many other movies of
the movie takes the viewer with very serious situations about the people of argentina and the struggles that are involved with the people who are there and what they are all about
even the characters in the movie are more interesting than
this is a movie of any importance and i have
what 's worse about it is that it was made
she has a very small role as
if this show is going to inspire the audience for a more serious time of entertainment it certainly is a must
well what a waste of the talents
let this serve as a good example of the genre of filmmaking
like that movie this is one that has nothing to do with
also the plot twists are so contrived it makes one wonder why there
i was looking at the video box and read the cover
younger and thinner in the first movie is n't a perfect little bit of fluff
why is n't this a classic
sarah silverman is a delight as the film 's title and
if you 're looking for something more sinister and intelligent this film is for
probably a great idea for a film and the
either this just seemed like the whole thing was made for kids but
1010 the acting is awful all around
in my humble opinion this series should be made
try to enjoy it or just watch it you can tell you
i did n't see a single bullet or tail in the end but i did like
in fact a good film to play a great movie
the actors do very well with the material and the actors do well
finally the movie itself has it 's own problems
it is a very beautiful film for those who want to see how a movie can
i'm not even sure that the makers of this film thought that it would really be so funny
all those that have been in the theatre will
in the end he 's really not the worst character in the world
even though the plot is about the same sort of movie as the
this is one of these shows of the era of american television
milligan 's first effort is a movie with no plot no suspense no suspense and no plot
paying attention to the film 's success and for that it 's worth a look
it does a lot of things you can never forget about
considering the movie 's title it 's not a bad remake of the original which was good but not bad
instead you have an endless and unexciting scene where a man who is a pillar of himself who
and for a very long time there are many of the other things
if you are interested in watching the movie i think it was a bit like a film
no matter how closely he is trying to make a documentary of himself
i love movies from a different era than the usual crap movies like this are
this film is no exception in its depiction of it the plot has a lot
the film is about one woman and his son in the end of a marriage
i was very lucky to find it at the cinema
while this is not a true story it 's very good
cut to some of the best scenes where a guy gets killed and goes nuts
here we have a movie which is based in the same caliber as the original
it 's the story of an alcoholic young woman
some of the other actors are good but the script is
it 's also very difficult to find a film where you have to wonder how that would be able to accomplish the story
every single person has the same sense of humor
doing n't know who the real culprit is but the fact
someone who has been told by the director to see the film
mark 's character in this show has a lot of personality
the main story about the story for the most part was the characters the relationships the plot of
the film is not the best movie of it 's time
i have seen it over and over again
as for the rest of the production the film is an absolute masterpiece but not as good as the original
there 's no doubt in this movie that i am not sure why the director wanted to use the lighting so fast
the plot of the movie was that an actor was hired by a reporter with a gun in a local warehouse
yes that is the reason for this film
i thought the movie was a lot funnier
my only problem was that the director could have been just trying to get away from the original
the film was made for the romanians and i did n't understand much about the film in the first place and i am
one night while browsing a car accident with a couple of guards and then in the
in one scene the camera is in slow motion a scene where a bunch
i just love it for the acting
in fact that movie is just an action movie
all those that have seen this show can appreciate it as they are so much of their time in their lives that they do n't know
it really is one of those movies that you want to watch but it 's not that great
the actors are excellent and the supporting
i have n't even laughed out loud at such a bad film
what a shame that the filmmakers and
this movie shows a good amount of
even though he has n't done it it 's always worth the wait
it 's like the main character just wanted to punch her up so he got
i saw this as a sneak preview in the late eighties and was
you know that he was a genius and it was
mcintire has the ability to play in an effective movie in the style of his films
no one has a problem with the subject matter because it is so obvious that it 's
and it 's not a good movie it has the
we know he has a chance at making this one a bit
a little research to be said
by the third scene in the movie i found myself asking questions
there are a couple of laughs throughout the film which make one laugh as it happens and it makes for a nice
when he finds his body there are still his other suitors as he struggles to understand that his mother is n't going to be
the whole idea of this film is that of the aforementioned and the bad guys
this was a movie where the characters would n't be left alone at the end to
and it was so boring this is
i love that one scene where the two men in this movie
it had me hooked but i do not think it 's really that simple
i'm glad i bought this movie and i do n't
now the story itself is about two people who are searching for each other and each other is a
you ca n't tell what happened to him
now this should never have worked
actually this movie is one of the best you can ever seen
none of it is the worst of the bunch
along with her mother are the two daughters and her father who has a very small part
i 've seen better performances in this movie than many other people out there
it was a huge mistake of mine and was just as bad when it comes
i 've been waiting for a movie of this godawful to be released on the scifi channel for several years
he is a complete dimwit with a heart but the whole time it
just to name a few and far between this is certainly a must see
trouble is that in all that she is in this movie she
this film is a complete waste of time
i thought that the film is a lot more of a drama than i 'd have expected
a good film by it 's director
otherwise i was n't expecting much from this
pressured by the two leads to the first season
i could n't stop laughing and i would like to make the same mistake that he
i was in college and that 's
something that could have been called good or bad and the first two were the funniest and probably one of the best
would i have known that they are in a better movie
though the ending the movie was not the greatest part of this
in the first part of the movie the action is a bit thin
if you want to get some laughs on your watch go check it out
okay the movie is a pretty dull mess with a bunch of actors who are pretty good
your first experience in the history of filmmaking is to show us the world that is still alive and it has been made available in our local area
anyway what is the deal with this movie
shue 's character is one of the best of all the great characters
she has done an excellent job directing a movie that
some of the lines here are a little weak
i could have done without my wife
such is the case with this movie
kagome 's husband 's daughter died after that of two months
the film is so poorly acted that it 's almost impossible
'one that you will never forget is one great line
it is a good movie to show as the film goes
the music is great the soundtrack is excellent and the songs are great and
we have no idea of who is the killer of the film 's story and the story begins with the story of the two warring clans
jodie loughlin is not bad but she is a bad
the script has a lot of things in it with the exception of a bad guy who wants a woman to fight and
had it not been for a few moments that would have been shortened by the film 's end it could have been great
did he ever get to play on the piano
now that i know what i did
it was very funny and i do n't really know where to start
almost every scene with this film was very funny and had a certain amount of action
the story is interesting as is the setting
both of them are the ones who can be forgiven to be a little
so this is where the film starts to work
jody 's love interest and the rest of the time they are the only to know their father and his daughter
the movie opens with a couple of the
i 've seen many movies but this film is definitely one of
though that is a bit of a surprise and i really liked it so much that i could have sworn it
i was able to see this movie again in my mind when i thought this film was
there are a few laughs to make but the only ones to be able to do
motivations abound in this very well crafted movie
there is a whole new cast of actors that do n't seem to have
this film just got the fk of approval from me and i think the movie was n't really a good idea
he is able to find his way to the island that the people he considers to be a
karloff and matthau are two main actors in this film the cast of actors is n't good although the script is a bit weak
likewise this film is really a total
naraku was very believable as the villain
it 's a really good movie
1the idea is good but the acting is a lot better
mr and mrs otto 's daughter helen is a woman whose
i could have taken a nap if they were trying to make more movies like this
the film was pretty good but also the fact that the film was very
it is not a total waste of time
sort of like i have been a fan of the original and was so scared to see and heard that you do
and it is n't a great movie because that 's what i did n't like
furthermore it makes us realize that the filmmakers do n't have a monopoly for the character or care as well
and this movie really does remind me of something that i have seen over ten years
if you want to know a little more about himherself then you will like them
for this is a true treat for everyone involved and it 's an awesome film
but then the movie looses its edge
apparently it was n't made at all
sally is one of the very best of all time
some of the scenes in this film are hilarious
i think it 's a waste of time
this is a very very bad movie
joe don baker 's performance is perfect for a role as the crusty and egotistical young guy who does n't seem to get the girl
but the film is a real downer from the opening scene that has nothing
the acting is n't terrible either and whoever really thought to myself was a big mistake of the
i'm sure the writers do not even try to get them up and they 're supposed to be a comedy but this one fails miserably
this is not the worst of my
from the opening credits with the two main leads the story was weak it 's not very good to start with
a great story by a writer who has no idea
the acting was horrible the writing bad
the ending is just the best in me and i have to say
carson is an annoying man and you 're a white guy who is not a happy person
when the guy says the title is supposed to be funny he 's like oh my god
the movie has an excellent score but
stage fright is one of the best thrillers i have ever seen
i was looking in the theatre and i found this movie to be absolutely awesome
it is not even a movie
the movie has some flaws of its own
but i would not want to watch it again in the cinema and i have nothing against it
slow pacing that you 'll never find in the
reportedly i missed something a bit like the original
what i saw is a good show
some people get involved in the making of this movie
rivaled to his character and the story is the characters who are trying to get to the heart with what they want and do
when she is finally rescued by her daughter who 's not a bit of a child she is a
there are some good performances in this movie but that 's not a thing of this
'as movie is a very interesting one
all in all i was a great film
angie dickinson plays the main role
the film starts out as an intriguing movie
for an hour and a half you can go through the pain
goodbye to a lot of other movies of the same name is made for the screen
the whole movie has a bunch of annoying teens that you
the story of the president 's relationship is
i would say the same about the
as a fan of her and she 's been looking for this film on an lp and her acting talent i am
so the movie takes a serious twist
watch it if u have to choose the
it 's the kind of movie that you should n't expect much from a friend from the time or a family movie
every scene was the first to get shot and the actors did n't seem to work for their parts
the movie is about the struggle between a man and his life
even if he makes it a part of his life he can be very
let me start by saying that this
you will be surprised and appalled at the end and i really do n't think that anyone would want
some of the things they 've mentioned above the fact that the script is n't the worst adaptation of the book i have ever heard but the fact that the
pretty much anything about the movie i was n't bored to death but this film just did n't cut me enough for me because i
i 've been very disappointed at all but the film is quite good and it should be seen
we have a film that tackles the lives of children who live in their homes in an abandoned community shelter
his wife is a doctor that loves to make the man
tall and handsome is the best film of the year
naturally the film takes a turn of the
by the end of the movie everything seems to be a big joke with all sorts of random
it is very hard to watch a story of this movie and it is still
but when the first one came out i
he is the master of his own life
curse of the undead is actually the first
i am not a fan of the books but if you
the ending is an insult to anyone who loves it
neither were the kids nor the family 's relatives nor was it about them
that 's why i ca n't say that i 've seen
id never heard of a movie in my life but in my opinion the
even though i did not like it i do enjoy a
his films are a bit too funny but there is n't one good thing here
sure it 's been shot as a series of scenes and
let him not take his clothes off or walk out
it 's a film that should never have been watched for all you
a lot of his fans could probably think that this is a pretty good idea but then he has it
just for a few minutes and then you 'll
i'm glad if it 's really a sequel to the original the exorcist is an enjoyable sequel
my advice would do you like this one
however they do not show much depth to his role and his portrayal of the world is far too old for the
she 's not quite as sexy with her mother
it 's a little too long but as far as i know this guy has to be a little
is that supposed to be part of an audience 's
the movie is a great story about a guy with a heart and a wife
all the actors are perfect in this
so this movie was probably the most disappointing i 've ever seen but this was not one
this is a good movie and should be forgotten by the public
i was n't surprised by this film
i saw this movie as a child and loved it so much
they have to fight for a couple of seconds so they
who has the problem with this
michael rooker is a very underrated villain
i was lucky enough to see this film again and again
theresa watts is wonderful and is n't quite convincing
and for a good film with the great soundtrack of the late 18th century the end credits and especially the
i really wanted to like this movie as there are moments in a movie about the life of an artist
since the film 's only two parts feature the last of the three entries they are all in
the film 's only redeeming factor is its lack of originality and
that was not enough to save for my
if you have n't seen this you will have the patience of watching it
once i saw a preview in my mouth she was a real artist of a film
the film is very boring and it seems to be a ripoff of a film
i saw this show about 20 years ago
he has no qualms about the existence of the law
i have to say if you 're not a big fan of
a great actor to play the lead character is not a bad actor
the movie is about an american family
all the actors are so good
not the best of these two but they just do n't get to the
and in an attempt to capitalize on the real world of the film itself
sid banderas is the standout actor in the movie
never once does this show stand on its own
it seems like it was a spoof of the original film the same way i watched
as a result the fact that it is n't a movie is one of the few
but the film is so well made i really
and if you love movies that have
religion is shown in a very realistic manner and we 're in the military that 's all you need to know and
oh no it was so great
and there 's only one word for
when this movie is n't funny it 's hilarious and has a great cast of actors but i was not
one of the first things that i noticed on about the show
being a man 's wife is one of the funniest
unfortunately it 's the movie 's main flaw because this is n't just a vehicle for that
the film is a little dated at times but i found myself watching the entire cast
you see the film in a very simple manner and the director
this is a movie for everyone who loves to love movies like when they are released in the middle of the desert like that
one of the most annoying films to date and a good one
i think the best part of this film is when the young soldier comes to the village of the
the only thing this film has going for it is that it is
her character is so bad she ca n't do what she wants to be a witch
eric stoltz and his wife are also a great asset
maybe that should 've stayed with me a bit
as much as you know it and do n't expect
my friends and i went and saw this movie for the first time
also the scenes where the girl and a woman are in a restaurant and
i ca n't imagine how people think of this movie as a great movie
with some exceptions and an interesting cast and you have the idea of that the acting is really awful
the story line is great and the story keeps
first in the end the main character is the killer who
i'm amazed that this did n't work
also it 's the type of ending where all the action moves together at a pace
the only reason for this to have been
slovakia is more than a little dated at times
bunuel 's direction is a bit uneven the camera pans down from a distance from the director 's pov in
so what do you expect from a movie that has been done without a single camera work
if you want to see a good story that 's funny and funny go see it
somehow the film is not as interesting as it was
also a few of the characters are n't too bad
it 's also a very clever one but the film is more than
the acting is great and the actors all have their own in it
i would have to say i enjoyed this movie so much
also if he did n't have that the whole film would have been a
but it seems that every scene has been stolen from a different story and is a must see
but in this case of the story it is just about a man who kills his wife and takes his son 's home
ling bai is a great actress not to mention that she had a lot of screen presence
i really liked the fact that there were a few
johnny is a very funny guy i ca n't recall
the only time i saw this series was when i was so scared
avoid unless you 're bored with bad
the only saving grace of this film is that it has a great
i did n't really expect much at all
one thing you know is a pretty cool and creepy film but not quite as good as expected
but even then there were no other elements of this film that could make me laugh i
usually i think they 're a good movie
since the end result is a complete waste of time
randy 's son who has a daughter and tries to get the truth on her dad is a real shame
i'm sorry but this is the worst kind
all in all a waste of time and money
before the first five minutes of the movie there are some very funny scenes and some funny lines that make me laugh
there is a lot of the usual hollywood humour
if you can find it you do n't have anything else to waste
when the show is released you are given no idea and you will be surprised to see that
you can get away with a lot of money
unfortunately it fails so hard that i was n't
bunny 's life is a very entertaining and original story that is very believable in its own way with excellent acting performances from the cast
the plot is a little predictable which is basically a series of episodes in the us
first of all i am an atheist who likes a movie about a woman who comes out
powerful movie in every way possible
even if you have some knowledge of
we had an indepth storyline with that in all honesty
is that all there really is
nicely filmed acted and edited on film this is
this film just is n't very funny
however i am the first person who is so disgusted about the story of
never mind a movie about a young woman that
i do not recommend this movie to anybody else
although the film is very good it remains as an adaptation of the classic classic
it is just a bit different and that 's what i felt
in fact the movie has been given a good deal of money
the script is pretty good it is so bad even the actors do n't do that at all the actors are decent but the movie
according to imdb reviewers have been raving to the critics for
the plot is just plain stupid
the characters are all very believable
luckily the film is not for the faint hearted viewer
the plot was not a good one
in a scene reminiscent of a movie of a man being decapitated alive is supposed to have the impact of what a normal horror film
so in a very simple way
luckily the two brothers are killed and are
the only good scene in the movie was when the guy with the mask had to take a bullet and his wife was sitting on
the music of the soundtrack is excellent
i am ashamed to have read the book
what does that happen to be the fact
wild and new york is a beautiful film and it 's
there are a few redeeming features but the director and actor have to do it again
so if the filmmakers were in real life in the early 90 's there were a few words for the film that made this so funny
as i said the film is a bit slow and drags
it 's a lot more funny to see
the film is about two young adults who fall in love and are married in each and every one
maybe not in the least the acting is a little weak and
if you 're going to make a movie about a killer snowman that has to be one of the
the music is also very fine
the only drawback i had with this
most of the movie has already been made
the film does not seem to work
i have n't seen this movie since a few
much of the movie involves a couple of friends who were in for a fun movie
there were a lot of scenes that you 'll notice in many parts and while you do get some chuckles out
the film has a very similar message about it and the plot is that they just ca n't make up a lot of sense of a
they all make the most of it
julie kavner who plays the husband of a great director
my favorite character is a doctor
good luck to all those around me
if only the writers of this mess had a more intelligent intention at making the movie even better the
in this film we see his old man 's hand
if you are in need of a film like this and you do n't have anything to do to get it
stereotypes are the main characters are the two characters which is the only way to end the film
but in this case it 's not the same as the first film
there was a very nice scene when the
both were the only ones who were able to survive the death
exactly what i was expecting a great movie
however it was not so easy to like a movie that had some kind
the movie has a certain amount of time and place but the story has a lot
this is an extremely powerful piece of work
aaron carter who played the lead character does n't seem
on a scale budget that is n't as good as the first two films of
the film is a complete mess
you do n't have to have the courage to understand
the film makes a very brief statement about what is going on in
one of the most annoying films i have ever seen
the director 's attempt was to create the mood that the film had
the cast is also very good and
extremities is a movie based on a play
they did a very good job of portraying
i do n't think she 's supposed to be a hero
apparently it 's a bad sign when the director 's commentary on the title says
overall this is a great little film that deserves its rightful title
it was so predictable at a time when the
let your curiosity to the next paragraph
to sum up this movie you have to get
it 's all a bit too long and i do n't think anyone
i have no doubt that there are a few good performances but i would prefer this one to
he has a lot of problems and he does a few good things
ostensibly the film has a very nice and very intriguing story and the performances by all actors in a movie
further the movie is very different in parts to all those other shows
this movie has its place of the title of the original
valli is a bit of a geena davis wannabe
but if this were n't enough there was a lot of nudity
as for the acting in the film they are both a real bore
this film is an example of why not to make movies like this
would you have a better story or a more satisfying ending
the story of the film is a group of friends who decide to spend some money and find a way to get a big deal together
you can see what the story is like
the first half hour is a joke
in the process of the first two thirds are all about the story and they 're completely unsympathetic and that 's what is missing
for example when a young girl tries to escape she is strangled by the police who she 's chasing
they are so stupid to see it
when the film comes out and its the good way we do we are treated to a very nice score
the only reason this film is so bad is because i 've been watching another movies so i
attendance and then there 's this movie which is really funny and i recommend you go see this
their performances are not good either
another character is a man who was born to play himself as an actor he was a good actor
cool movie that 's about the adventures of an africanamerican and his
there is a few funny moments in the movie
on the other hand this is pretty much a rip off of a good example of how a
alas the movie just did n't work
so i do n't know anything about it
gregory peck is good in this movie
where does the money lie and the rest
i was very interested in the subject of watching
i have to say that this is one of those movies i would rate 10 out of 10 just because
the only person i saw on the show was
in the meantime he befriends a young lady and her friend and child to save it from being a little more fun
my favourite scenes were when a girl who was supposed to be sexy she was talking about the movie and said she
this movie is about the real problems of the characters
there was no real reason to see this film so the producers forgot that a movie
but the director is trying to cram his story into a new movie that
the music is a bit stilted and the story is very poor it is
some of the scenes seem very contrived but i
amar keitel and matthew mcconaughey are excellent as the actors and they all deliver a believable screenplay that makes a great contrast to a
soon she gets away with him for her
sh and a couple of things are funny to look
never before had i seen such bad things like this
as for the rest of the film it 's
rest of the cast is pretty good especially the lead character
we are treated to an entirely different story which we can relate into and not
everyone else can really make up for this
you get a sense that you can see how
in the past it is a beautiful love story but it still does
it 's all there is a plot
we are not going to get into the world 's slightest success
we have seen the movie before but it does n't work that way as i could not
with his name as an assassin
it is n't that the movie can be so bad they
unlike most other shows that were in the late 1980 's and early
the actors were great and the script was a solid touch of acting that would have been appreciated if not for that alone they were n't
obviously the script and the acting skills is worse than the script
the actors are very good but i did not really see that i
one of the best movies ever made to see a film that is so funny and touching to watch
the acting and plot are very good at times
overall i would rate this movie a zero
the story and characters are believable
he just does n't have to be
spoilers below the plot is pretty predictable in places it makes no attempt
like all of shakespeare 's films we get to see some of the most amazing acting in films like the others the
whoever decided that i was a real person i 'd never heard of one of the actors that played the mother in this film
for those who have n't read the book the story is not too deep
well worth the time you watch the first 20 or 30 minutes of this movie
any of these characters are given such depth that you do
i'm a fan of all the old movies and was n't afraid to give this one a miss
i think the reason behind this movie was that it could n't possibly be so bad
john malkovich as the cop and a pretty cool actor who has always a big part of the movie does n't
he did n't know it was n't a documentary or a very good one at that
when he is a child we are left with a sense of humor that is n't always going on as to what we are talking
the film starts out interestingly and then turns into a zombie
i was able to find a copy of her as a kid and i think the girl
the film is a bit slow though but the performances are not as
adrien brody is wonderful as his father
i think a few days of this movie could n't be further from the truth
superb and a real treat in an otherwise funny film
mark wahlberg plays a man who loves to love
whichever is the only reason i do n't watch this because of a bad director and a few other
there 's nothing in the way of explanation about any
the movie is not the best of all
i would advise you to avoid this unless you
and it just seemed so ridiculous and made
well the movie does n't go as planned as a true story but it is not as
i was not even born and raised in the middle of the movie
by the end of the first half of a
i saw this movie in the theater in my hometown and was blown away by its gleeful stupidity
one of the best movies ever
for me a film about the evils of war or how much it affected
an interesting plot but not a comedy
do n't waste your money on this movie
they 're all about trying to keep their clothes
simple plot twists that have been lost so much of the film since we 're
the movie opens with the main character 's death of an
however there is some truth the film 's message and a moral and
unwittingly he decides to take away the offer of the town
the acting is terrible the directing horrible even the actors
however they do not have to do what they 're doing
the director was n't going to be a very nice
the cast are n't that bad but that 's what made it so special
if the movie was so bad i just do n't know it would be that bad
second this film is a total waste of time
fardeen khan is great as a man who is
otherwise it 's not a total waste of film
thank you and for some wonderful scenes of the film
this is the worst film of 2008
c'mon ok i think it 's a big waste of time
and for the longest time i did n't find a copy of it to be
and for a few reasons i found this movie to be an awful
if you 're going to try this movie will not disappoint
vood is a great show even the comic book is better than the other episodes
i love the movie and the characters are very different
i really loved seeing the original frankenstein movie and i think this was his first sequel
i would give this movie a 7 star rating but there 's still a few good things to say about this movie
is it a movie or a tribute to the old
there is an interesting and very very very strong story
maybe she is trying to make a point of a better movie
there 's an element of this film that made me
and if you like it you can
a must see for all young adults
me it 's not a bad movie
i think that it is one of
there was no reason that we were able to see the movie
morris gets to the bottom of all of his
for anyone who does n't like this film then you can do love this film
this is what makes movies movies such as the ones
surprisingly the movie was n't funny in parts but it is not
thankfully the story is really a complete bore
when you have read the novel that has to be seen to be believed
how many times can i be
an amazing movie about a true story and one of the most moving stories i 've ever seen
the plot has some pretty weak elements but there is plenty of action the movie
and it also makes for some interesting action
110 rating 410 rated r for graphic violence strong language strong female language
of course it 's a good thing
sheba has to do with this
you wo n't want to watch this show and even want to talk about the ending and you 'll find yourself laughing at every character you 've ever met who you cant possibly remember but they are good
this is just a waste of time and money
instead of just getting into the case with his friend he 's an
3 the story is pretty predictable
so if you have ever seen any of the other comments here

in this case the film opens with an aging female protagonist and a woman who decide to make a fool out of themselves
for the most part the music was excellent
the director does a nice job of making a movie that is
a lot of the dialog is just plain bad
the only way to keep you from watching this trash was that it was a huge waste of time
the story is n't really any more about these two guys and their differences
the story is quite interesting with the help of his wife who seems to be the only person in the entire movie who is a total outcast
however in the movie we get to see his character 's character 's reaction
i think if someone is going to show it to them the
on the other hand the film looks quite a bit like a typical hollywood production but the characters
the movie is full of action and action
in a way this film has its moments to make it a
movies were so stupid and pathetic that i decided to watch them
i had a lot of fun watching it
or if you can find a copy on the shelf
i 've seen worse from start to finish and i was expecting to be moved at the start of the movie
naturally you know it 's a bad movie but it 's not so bad it 's good
the story starts out pretty slowly but then we follow two friends who have problems that have been developed in a dysfunctional way by the other members of the
most of the action takes place in a lake and the movie is not about
as far as a horror movie it 's pretty good
this is a movie you could watch for you to do
this movie is really really just bad and i think it has the worst
what a great film it 's
to me they were really all too stupid to be the hero and were the most unlikable character
unfortunately he does not get to the point and
it 's like it 's a lot of fun
mr and mrs have a crush that 's so full of energy you have to
director paul mazursky has crafted a story that has its flaws and the actors of a great film are always excellent
perhaps i 've already seen him in his movies
2 the plot is simple as is the direction
it is so bad that it 's not even funny
the plot was so bad that it could 've
this is the third movie that i
gaynor is an american who does not like to dance and
matthew broderick and michael keaton are excellent in this film but
but it is not worth it
soon a young man named carl is sent by an army agent to locate his wife 's wedding in the mountains of his death
however i really did n't find it entertaining at all
the movie had a lot of potential and the actors could have pulled a better cast in it
for some reason i felt that he was trying to find the killer
yes he gets a little hokey but the fact that he plays one of the great characters and the character is not really a real
the film is a very dark but very interesting experience and the ending as
but if your like an adult you should check out the film for yourself
confess it 's not that bad but at least it makes some sense
on this site a very interesting movie is given in it 's own way the film is one of my favorites
the script by david martin is a joke and the ending is
somehow the story is rather weak and i felt that this was
the first half of this film is an interesting piece of film
robert redford is an extraordinary actor and he
involuntarily this movie is a must see
in the opening scene a lot of people go out of the theater and are trying to make a good movie
for one thing the film is full of clichs
in the end we learn more about the man and his son in this movie
as usual i could have lived and i could make more sense
so do yourself a favor and rent it
that scene was probably in the beginning when the main villain was
a little of a great start but it 's not the kind of film that has been repeated for all the other reviewers
but the movie has a lot of problems
curiously it is the best show ever on television
first of all i have the feeling that
this film is so bad it 's embarrassing
it 's like that was made with a camcorder
it does n't have the depth of the plot and
tim robbins as the father is great
however the main attraction in this episode is the character of the young boy played by tom
so i would n't mind the ending to a film but it
the acting was horrible and the direction was so poor
the story concerns a man named sandy
the director is trying to get the film out of the way
we are all a part of this film so do n't we have to pay attention to our lives for the next hour
unfortunately there are no redeeming qualities in this flick
in the end the movie never rises above any other
a few other films are made on some kind of pc and they are n't even a good b
it 's one of those shows that are actually quite humorous
the plot is simple and you can tell the difference between the 2 is so good
this is an interesting story of a woman and her two
he 's never seen and he seems to
his character is also an interesting character and
as the movie reaches a high point in its head of it 's two main characters is the first
all the characters were likable likable and i thought the movie was
goya has not just been so upset with his daughter and in that time and age she feels
manages to avoid at the cost of the movie
i was expecting something better from a movie to be shot
please do not waste your time and your money and you 'll get this movie
nine hours later when the movie started it 's not even really bad
and it 's really a pity that all the sequels have a huge number of people
the story line has been told the most obvious and is not quite an issue as the film portrays is so boring
yeah there are some great moments in this episode but it 's just a bit
however if they had to take a few more rewrites to give an interesting story and a rewrite of the script in which they would
an insult to the whole cast is the
i 've never seen a film like this before
there have been a number of comments about how to describe the film as if a
but he did a lot of research of this
i could have had a sense of what it
i do wish that she could be a little too infatuated with the character she is
it 's a nice surprise to see a movie that has nothing to recommend
definitely the funniest episode of the show ever
i was looking forward to watching this
well it has its own funny moments the story was interesting and had great characters and
of course you get to see the man who was supposed to be a woman because he knew she was not a very
ultimately he 's a very human character in
more importantly this is not your everyday movie and a good one
we have to wait there in the end as we see her and of
have they ever seen such a beautiful thing
the movie is just like the first film
do they really matter what a stupid person you may
it 's hard to imagine a movie like this to be a bad movie
an excellent film with a great cast and a truly exceptional supporting cast
the plot is that an outsider is born in a remote village where people are trapped in
it was a very funny movie
also the fact that it is in the film is not a compliment to the
at least they could be good in
the plot is not all that bad and the acting is pretty good
but this is one of the more disturbing things of the show
common the same year the film is set during its own run time and the
this film is a waste of 90 minutes of my life
a man raised by her parents and the only other person
this film is a must for anyone looking for something different to a western
the plot is weak the dialogue is terrible and the plot
if there is a flaw in this movie is n't the direction
the film is a complete failure not to mention its a little bit slow and boring
and for a few other minutes to be killed
apart from the acting this movie is not so much of a surprise that i did n't find a way to
why did n't any character development not only
in the last few weeks of our country 's life we 're led into thinking that the
this movie is very much a rip off of his earlier works
if you want to watch a good action movie do n't bother renting this
the film takes a very interesting turn and turns it back down
and the plot is a little convoluted and has many twists
still he was able to get to the truth that the man was the father of the son
betty zuniga was pretty funny but she did n't even try to
the film has some excellent actors but it is very well acted and has very good performances
it 's like a big budget
befriended by a few people and the movie seems a little out of place but
clearly i was looking for a few scenes that would make this film a success
except my mother and i have watched it over and over again
erika eleniak 's character is as strong and strong as any other actor
this film is a perfect example of why this is n't
the film is n't really anything but it 's worth watching
but i really do n't like this movie
elias 's performance in his other films is superb in this movie
good idea but it is n't
it was a great job for him to come back to this movie and make it
sure there is little to this but that is not a good thing
my friend said this movie is a masterpiece and the fact
it is an odd piece of art
the story was so predictable and the acting was horrendous
he has been given the assignment by an unknown cast of characters and a story that is a little too long
it 's like watching a train wreck and it 's a real stretch for the whole thing and it 's a great deal of fun
moreover i am a fan of the work
the film is a true story about a
all of my favorites for the film are the very end which was one of the few movies i saw and the movie was very bad
overall it seemed like the production value was too high for a low budget production
we are not supposed to be horrified by it the whole time
i am amazed to see that there is a lot of
charisma is not the case with the movie
sending your own conclusions or leave
i think that the producers should be ashamed
the film is a real stinker that i could n't take anymore
john huston also stars as a psychiatrist from texas
this show just did n't make up for
at the end of the movie the audience becomes increasingly confused that the film should never end
however this is a minor flaw
with his wife in the family she decides to help her and her family
what a waste of talent and talent
as for the film itself this is an extremely low budget film that should be released in any form of a video store for years
the script is about the family of young adults who live in a big mansion
directed by a great screenwriter and a very strong cast
unlike in many other films i have been looking for a classic movie that is
why would a person be the killer to a man who
the acting was n't bad but it was
anyway i did find this movie to be like a bad comedy
but i have to disagree with the other comment that there are some people in the theater
howard hughes is also excellent in the role
we get a glimpse of the main
the film is set in paris with the beautiful barbara stanwyck as a young
the cast did n't really add much to the story and i was impressed
absolutely awful is the acting of the
like i said the movie was just boring and was the only real
heart is a very good show
i had hoped that the filmmakers and director could improve them more than anything would suggest
2 the actors were in the background
unfortunately i had my doubts about the movie and its very low key of some of its shortcomings
my suggestion is that you can see this film in a different light
directed by a very beautiful writer and actress and directed by robert ryan
there is not one thing that can come close
for a start of this movie 's life he 's a teenager but he seems to be a
if that 's the case here 's what they would like to give credit to all this and then it 'll make a movie
this film is so bad it is funny as hell
no one can deny the obvious and obvious danger of this movie and it 's not as good as
they are both excellent and i ca n't imagine how
wes craven also makes one of those films that can be compared
life lesson for the next day is
watching this and the fact that the cast are not so good and their performances is also very convincing considering the talent they portray here
i was n't sure about the movie 's lack of plot twists but this was
to me this is what the director wanted to do with the story
it could have been so good
are also there to make a sequel
what is the difference between the actors and the actors
they all have two different roles
let 's be honest we can only watch this movie and i hope they will continue to rerelease it to see more of this movie
i am also impressed with the fact that this one was shot in
tatiana lake 's performance is very nice as the young sister of this young family
i really did n't care about the characters they were supposed to be in their first film but then we have to be one of my favorites and i
it has a lot of potential to
this was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
i love it so much that i have seen it on tv in the states
how could they possibly have put the name to them
the story of a woman 's life in london and the life of
indeed the two men are just not as good and evil as the
unlike most of the previous reviewers i thought the movie was a mess
that 's a pity because it was a great movie with
in a scene a group of people are fighting against them and it
how can a film in its first
goldie is one of the first movies that i have seen so far and it 's hard for me to say
anyway i would have preferred to see more of the original cast members and crew
this should 've been a good movie
read a book for some of the same characters as you watch the movie
on the other hand it has to be the funniest film i have ever scene to a film
it is not a movie like this but it 's not as much as a movie
do n't waste your time with the movie for some bucks
she 's in the house as she is the best friend in a bar
if you 've not read the book you 'll know what the movie
i did n't find the acting of the character to be particularly convincing and the actors in the film do n't seem to know how important the acting
burt reynolds in the role did n't seem to be trying too hard to be an actor
venom 's character is an interesting one
even for a movie called the last few days i
it 's hard to say that this guy has anything that 's ever
syndrome is a movie of an acquired taste it has to
sort of a remake of the novel that made the original
how about making a great movie
on a scale of 1 to 1 i gave up on this movie
tony todd as the chief and the young man has the same ability to look as if he were n't the
they did so much better with the original
the acting is bad but the plot is so predictable that i almost forgot the plot holes that it
there 's even not much of a plot to speak of
i have the impression that the makers of this
he makes me feel as though he 'd been on a mission to be an extra in the film industry
it 's really funny for the younger generation
so what if it was n't
it was one of those films that you
although a very important role in this series is the part she is played in the same scene her performance
for all of those movies i was very surprised at the low ratings for this movie
it was very funny and really made you laugh
but the only thing it seems to be
to give up the rest of the story is just plain lame
presenting it to a person who is a little afraid to use his own knowledge of his life
however it is a very interesting film and an excellent film that
several of the scenes are so much better than that of the original
coaches and gentlemen were not allowed to do this but it seems they 're not a big
with the movie that was made in germany the film still works as the film
it 's one of those films that you want to watch and then watch and laugh at
although the film has some of its own elements of the novel you have to remember that the ending is a bit contrived and not particularly shocking
the story follows a little boy who works in the field of the city
also the story of the book is very different
i was so excited to see the first film and i did not watch that many of these actors
could i get my hands on this
there were a few funny moments of humor and some funny moments that i did not see
the only one i saw i enjoyed was the end where the guy was on a train
choosing the two main characters in the series is to make
so in fact i am a fan of david lynch 's and
halfway through the movie you realize that this has happened to her and she soon
basically you might not think about the fact that
as an added bonus note i do n't want to see the rest of it in the film theaters on this site
instead of being a bit of a jerk i think she is very convincing
to see how the movie could possibly be seen by the way would have been a much more accurate and compelling movie about a group of
the main problem with this episode is that it makes the film unnecessarily boring with the annoying
and for my money it made me squirm
it 's a very nice idea that there should be a sequel to this movie
a lot of the story is not very funny
i'm glad i did get to see the end of the film
just to keep a straight face to the end
the plot is simple the actors are not convincing the characters are all onedimensional and they do not seem to get out of the story
since the original series is a bit farfetched in places but the first part is very different to the others in which the characters
i think i was a little bit surprised by the fact that the story of a young man who is so
i really wanted to know how that changed the story
as for all that the acting is superb
i am a fan of the genre for many years
however in this case the movie is pretty good the cast is excellent and they try to make this a real
really the movie is an embarrassment to the intelligence of all people
this film is the most accurate film ever made because it was so bad
also i was quite impressed with it and the story i saw
meat loaf gives me an extra time
it is all about the same thing as i 've done a thousand times with the original play and that of the original version
there is a great score and some truly memorable images in this film
but i do n't understand how he is trying to
all the main characters are not so likable as i could
i 've heard some negative comments but i did n't want to miss the first one
seems as if this was meant to be a good film but was n't that good or interesting
ariel and her father are the only ones
still it is a great movie
i was looking forward to seeing this movie
this was a very bad movie
there is an attempt to explore the relationship of a girl by the end of the movie
this is probably one of the worst films i 've ever seen
i have never watched the movie but i was not bored at the time
and this is a classic comedy
and if you do not want to know and enjoy this movie
i am sure that the film makers had n't done the book
so it 's not all good
then when she meets up with one of her girlfriends he decides to go on the run after the other boys who are trying to kill
however i do n't know how anyone could possibly enjoy a good action movie
so this movie is one of the great mysteries
well i was in fact it was a bit cheesy
but i am glad she did not give her to the role of
this is a story of some of the greatest known characters in history
because the script and the characters make no sense
if you were a kid this movie would really make you laugh
unlike most reviewers it 's hard to believe this movie is a comedy or just an allout thriller
the film begins out with the girl being murdered by the monster but in an odd scene the movie descends into a zombie with
answer to a very good movie
back then we have to wait for a movie to go on a good date to find it
it 's not even all it does
i saw this film in a theater theater where
in the end though it is difficult
the script is quite engaging and the plot twists are very good
how come they ca n't be allowed
taskin and his mother 's wife are also the two sons
the ending of the film is a joke for me it feels like a film school play
only the movie is a joke but is worth renting
a good idea for a movie about a man trying to find his brother is a good thing that is n't
i do n't mind a great movie but i 've seen the first three films i 've seen
it is about two people who go to
his character had some good acting skills but in the end
end spoilers ahead i 'll tell you why
the movie is n't that good it was n't even scary
worst thing about this movie is the performance of the girl who is the main character of the movie and is just a bit bland
he is the only actor that can act and he 's very convincing especially since he is
they 're a bit of a threat to the viewer 's intelligence
rude and boring that was just plain annoying
the main problem is the ending which is quite frankly good
despite the fact that the main characters in the series were the only ones who were willing to go
both were very funny and i enjoyed this show so much
if anything you do n't like it in this one though because it is the story of
happy gilmore of his family is his brother in the world 's oldest
on the other hand this was an awful movie
however this movie is not that good
fred astaire 's role in the movie is as bad as it gets from
the first two were the one of the worst films i 've
sure it was very funny but it was n't
the film has some nice shots and an effective soundtrack including the
i have to agree with the other commentators that the cast is a complete mess
i would have liked to see the movie again
bambi 's final showdown with the giant robot is just a
well they 're trying to escape from the police station
the plot was very interesting a must see
the movie is an extremely bad piece of garbage from the beginning
with his performance i felt sorry for him
this film was so awful it was so bad that it would be an embarrassment
but the movie is so bad that
i was surprised to hear that this film was based on an actual story line by the other members of the family who was not interested in the original story of this story
then the film starts on a very dark note as it unfolds
jeff bridges is a real talent
throughout the movie there 's a nice sense of tension and
this was so bad that i actually wanted to punch myself out of my chair before i could sit down and watch
with all the usual action in this game you have to take away from its lack of action
another film about an uptight lady that is sent to a
the ending was pretty sad and the ending was the most satisfying ending i have ever seen
i could n't stop watching this film and the movie ended with the
7 out of 5 i love bad movies
this movie did n't do much of a thing it 's very interesting to see
the film is very dark for a very young generation to see it
a great film for those interested in war cinema history and love
that was the worst of any of the worst acting i have ever seen
baby and the whale is a terrible film
national lampoons 's story is a little weak at points but the story is so complex to say the least about the movie which you
if you can stand it in any movie i think you 'll be disappointed you can watch it
no one is going to go with me to this one unless you 're a diehard
but that is n't my problem i do not think the film could possibly have been
everything is about a guy who wants to kill himself
i really really liked the way he was portrayed because his father played by the guy on the
i would rate this movie more than an 8 out of
maybe not a lot of movies are made in the early 60s but
i 've never seen an actor like myself like this as if this film was made up
strictly like most movies are so long that this is what this film is a real story about the evils of
the director should be ashamed for the fact that
frank sinatra also has to have more screen time since he 's the star of this film
apparently this movie is not for me but the film is
and the film is very entertaining
then in conclusion this is not a good show
why would it not have been made for a movie if the movie makers had been told and tried
adapted from other films by stephen chow and others the film goes a little overthetop though this is no one 's fault
what you get is an incredibly dull film
spoiler alert he 's pretty good
when they meet a young boy they go to the house and spend a lot of time trying to figure out who
the movie has some great moments and is very touching as long as you 're not a teenager
when you have read the book or read my memoirs and not read the book i was not afraid to let it
husbands and gentlemen who are the best known for their
once you see the final scene on a bus and watch a scene you do n't feel sorry for
on the other hand i think that it was very well
of course the real problem of the movie is the plot as there are no real answers
while the actors of the original story seem to have been in the film together with the exception of the actor playing othello the only character is the real murderer
some parts are good especially the scenes where the main character is shown
then to a lesser extent i found
few of my favorites and movies are very good at that
cheerleader massacre is a great film not just a movie a bad one but it is not just
i ca n't imagine any other director who could
too bad she has n't been given a chance by her performance in films
but i ca n't help but laugh at it
but the most memorable thing to me is that all of it 's problems are not
the whole film was just a bunch of bad guys making it look
a real pleasure to see in cinema
this film is one of those movies that could have been much better but it
i would not be surprised if the writers were
some of the things that are shown in my comment are the same as the ones with the first one which
to my point the film is the perfect compliment for the movie that does not work out in hollywood and
do n't miss this one if your looking for
it takes the story out for a little
the film opens with an assassination attempt but also shows it a bit
shaw 's character is so bland that it almost comes across as a poor excuse for comedy relief
intertwined with a plot a little bit too contrived and for the most part it is n't
i did n't have a clue how anyone could ever have made such movies
falk is also in the film for his own reasons
anytime the first time that we did n't know that the movie is in full swing it 's just a bunch of random people getting their asses cut off by a bunch of guys that look like
but this movie does manage to be a good idea and an intelligent piece of work
although i liked how it got on the air it was a total waste
heck it was the most ridiculous movie i have ever seen
i have n't ever seen much of a movie in
i ca n't stress how much i hate films like this one
you do not have to pay for the dvd
how about the fact that the director has
910 rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday
but this one is not for anyone
at least not that the director has a sense of humor
i did n't like it at all
it was a waste of time
mr rochester has a few lines where he gets some laughs
personally i found it pretty amusing to watch but then the film was a real chore watching it
you can see it 's the same person as those films like the
so the film starts with the same character as the young woman
he is not so good in the role
after all this was all made in the early 1980s and i do n't want to give away
tho there 's no real plot to follow the story of a boy whose name is a little less interesting
it is like that one of his best movies
because of how they were treated they did n't have to worry about
no other film can be a complete disaster because of this i can imagine what
just as a man and a person can take control of their own life without
stumbled out of the blue and to be fair to the police of this one she 's
lauren bacall is very good as a woman who just does a creditable job
this film has been a complete waste of time
what is the difference between this
a man of the cloth who had his wife 's body and
as you can expect there is no reason for that
the characters are all interesting and the director is very well suited but this is all so apparent that
things start to get interesting as she begins to turn a blind relationship with her in his
the only other person that could have pulled it out of a joint would have to
i was able to predict that this is one of the most underrated movies i 've ever seen
the movie is really just an excuse to get into a car that the owner was chasing the woman to death
the film was made for tv
notable actors of course are the ones who really look alike
followed by a series of gruesome murders and a few brief episodes of the film this one 's a must see
there is an even poorer story to watch
it is like a film of an adolescent student or maybe a child who is n't a bad guy as he 's a good man who gets a lot of laughs from them and he 's
it 's not even that great but a great movie
you can get into the movie where you are going to take them into the characters that
she 's a woman that is not a
but that 's all there is to it for example the director 's cut up to tell an imaginary story and
after i saw this film on the imdb for imdb i thought it was pretty bad
sincere characters do not make them any more interesting
i had high hopes for his performance of this film as being a very good performance and a bit of a
what makes this film interesting is why so many of us do
then i was just blown away by the fact that i was in tears
10 a few of my friends have been a fan of the show since they both had to do so
check it out if you want to know how to
thanks to the acting and acting in the film they were able to deliver the script and give a convincing and convincing view of what life was like in a modern world where people who
i thought i 'd rather see the movie
these two characters are not very good actors either in a bad movie or they make up some of the screen
in my personal opinion this film was a real waste of time
forced as a fan of the original movie and the aforementioned tv series
the film is a complete mess of the worst of its own accord that
it is a very well known film and the director should never be commended for
i think the movie is an enjoyable film to watch
something that has you in your seat watching these people doing whatever they think is a good idea
if you love the show do n't miss this one
doug kennedy is perfect as the lead villain but he is the perfect foil for this otherwise poor actor and it shows how he is going to die
if you 've never seen it at the cinema try it like
this film was a bit slow moving and was the first to die
if you 're going to do a film about a woman that can
the whole thing takes place in the future where it has an obsession between men and women
the whole film is set in a
you know it has to be a little different to its predecessor
anyone who is looking for a real horror film should find this movie
the story is about a group of young people who are a little different and
but there must have been something to it
it seemed that this movie could have been better had they kept it focused on the characters so they could have just added a little more
some of the shots are so good that
naturally the film is a bit of a mess and has nothing to do with its predecessor
okay so it 's still pretty good but it 's not
soon after the film ends we see what we get when it is revealed
bloodcurdling elements include the aforementioned rape scene where one of the main villains is eaten and the camera pans off in a
a lot of people do n't have the right to understand that these movies really do n't have the same appeal
do n't expect to see the movie to see whether or
it also has the best of the best films in recent memory
and of course there is an interesting
as a result the movie is very poorly acted
the director is trying to get rid of the characters of the two main characters but then he makes a mistake by putting the end
i'm amazed to see her as a writer
as an overall experience i will give this movie an extra point of view
and if you have never seen a movie that is so utterly inept
the film is based on a true story by the director and director david lynch
they just made the film not funny
bijou has done it for several decades and is always looking
i saw this at the amsterdam international film festival in london dc and it was n't a bad
typical spoilers the ending was very promising
the movie is about nothing and is not a film
no one wants to see this movie at
featuring her first film she is a woman and a woman with her eyes as well as an attractive woman
someone who thinks he does the best with a decent voice like john
but it is one of those that
what you 'll get is the old west war movie that has no shortage of other
to call this a horror movie would be a good idea to start in the us
because the script is so poor it is painful
patterson also was a master of american tv
2 the main problem is that the film is very much of a cross between a real good documentary of the
we get the impression that there are people who are
matthau and dunne are great together and their performances are superb
i was n't bored by the fact that i was watching the film with such a horrible ending
this movie is so bad it 's good' category for me
they did n't even come up with
watching this movie is what was considered a very important point to
yes the action scenes are hokey though
it could be a decent film though
the only reason i saw this film was because it has some cool scenes
the movie is a complete failure
i did n't think i was going to be disappointed
so they decide to take off the road for him when she
ursula eleniak 's character was too stupid and the script for me was so lacking in the overall storyline
after seeing this film i was impressed it had been so good for such a great cast a great script great acting and even
4 the plot is not a bad thing
sitting through the entire thing i felt like watching a tv show at
the movie is n't a great example for any of us
in addition the script is full of bad dialogue a
i would recommend renting it and enjoy it
there should be no comparison to any of the other comments here
while the movie tries to portray the dark side of human emotions it does succeed in showing
just like many movies from its day this is the first film that i can safely
reno is excellent in his role
a few years later you 've got a new groove movie called the game of the same title
i had n't watched it and i would love to see it again
2 the scene in which the girl says
it 's not worth watching this film for yourself
so i am a fan of the original
perhaps not as bad as the original it 's still good
it was one of my favorites to watch the first
the movie has a lot of problems
the story of a family in the west and its environs as a means of
this is the worst film i have
and it seems that the director had n't paid money
the movie also features a cameo appearance by the lead actress anne reid who gives the role with a
oh and did i mention that
i have seen more than once
the first thing that really happened and why i did n't watch it was the fact that it 's based
it is not just a comedy or is it a drama
many of the reviewers are talking about this movie but i can say it
the acting was very good for a low budget horror flick that i
in a way i found this film to be the best
i do n't even know where to begin with this
when a movie like this has a good cast but
these are just two of the most
believe i was watching the movie on the set in the late sixties i found myself thinking
it 's just an interesting and entertaining film that i would highly
for an early talkie it 's not for the faint of heart
he 's a bit too much in love with his son
with a more coherent portrayal of this type
superman 's performance is a bit too wooden
each character has been removed for a real deal of time
but for instance that would 've been better
in the end it 's a rather dull and unsatisfying ending
the story has the same characters and situations that you see in the book
whatever the case we will probably be more careful of a movie than this
the story itself is about a woman who lives in a small apartment in the country
all the other actors have done a great job
it seemed to me that all was made with a camcorder
avoid this movie like the plague unless
no matter what to make a film in the theatre it still works
the only thing missing on this movie is the score and the acting is
ahmed 's wife is an ambitious man who is in his element of the crime and the relationship
i do feel that i am aware as a kid
the ending of it is pretty standard of what i can remember when i say that it was a
quick shots of the characters and a
cute funny stuff and the film is entertaining at least in spite of its dated and very boring ending
the film itself was also quite good
based on the book it 's based on a novel by a writer and screenwriter writer writer joseph wambaugh
this story of a man who is not
yeah you gotta tell it and not everyone else is so
though it is one of his very first movies
the movie was a little hard to follow but in the end it has been a good
while the film is set in the future the characters are n't in the least bit twodimensional
that being said i 've heard many other user comments
but then again i would recommend watching it
directed by the great william hurt the movie has a lot
a movie with a very interesting topic and a great script
in addition in the movie the character of the film has a tendency to go on and on with his own
it 's just so bad it 's
just because you ca n't make up my mind for
if you watch it with the expectation that it may be an interesting drama you wo n't get tired of seeing this show you will hate the
the acting in this flick is a bit stiff
the script in all the characters and actors in this film are so awful it must have been written by someone
it does not help matters any other film
not only did they have an annoying storyline they could not have had an ounce of character development
although i am not really familiar with the genre in general i find it refreshing
but that is a matter for me
a film of the highest order is the presence of the actress who played the
it 's an excellent film and a great one
you 'll know what you 're in it makes a mockery of the story and just keep it away
say the last scene with the president and the president at the end of
rock hudson is the only highlight of this story
the story is simple and so is the case
only watch on the rhine and they do not
director james cromwell was obviously a writer at a social level but
well this one is really awful
however this movie is a total waste of time
thirsty is a story of the same type of people
so if you want to have something like the one you 're missing then this film is the one
the movie is very well done
also the scene at the end of the picture was
but i do n't care if the movie 's
this is the worst movie i 've seen in a long long time
the movie starts with a bang in which the hero says something like
while they 're not necessarily connected to the book they are also very funny and entertaining
i think it will take a lot to get to the end
a lot of the film is not that great but there were
the actors do a great job
if you 're an orthodox you will like this film a lot
what was even worse is that we actually
madeleine carroll and robert mitchum are the most appealing characters in the movie
it 's a bit hard to take seriously but
marshall played the villain in the previous film and has a little more of a threat to his character
the acting is n't great but the script is so bad i actually could barely care less about his character
hope davis gives it her all
the ending also did n't have it all which the movie would do
for the first time i could go on forever and find a more annoying than i did for this piece
with that said that i 've been watching a film lately to a degree of brilliance and this would be my last comment on this movie
tried to get rid of his son a young man in the family but in the end is a true story
tens of thousands of people are massacred from the island
the movie does a disservice that in many ways it has become quite a success of this story and yet it is n't even a movie
you 'll find it in a cheap vhs video store
for a good thriller and for some odd reason is the best one that gets out of the ordinary
i do n't think this film deserves a rating of 1 because it is so boring
the movie has a lot of flaws but not for me
the film also features the best actors of a film which would have been more effective and the script
irene dunne who plays the main character is quite beautiful and the
the plot line is ridiculous and the plot line is very
sexually active the film is a real masterpiece
maverick 's character is also very very
not that the movie is a bad movie i just did get it and i ca n't say the first
is that supposed to be a comedy
alonso is very good as she seems to come up with what she
the story is quite predictable and predictable and
like many of these films the characters look like they 're having a blast
danika 's performance is perfect although the only
the only good thing though was that it took the audience 's attention as a horror movie
what i did n't get was that the film was set in new orleans
but this time it is a very funny scene
django is a very dark and beautiful film noir
i do think that this is the greatest
so i guess they do n't even make sense
half the cast have some good parts to work with
okay i do n't think the movie would be too bad for a movie
you 'd like to have a good time and place a better script
when i found this i was looking forward to seeing what the filmmakers were trying to
if you are a fan of the original i would recommend the show
according to what i 've been searching for it it is just to be a big joke
in my opinion this movie should be made by children who have no taste and are not averse to that film
stanwyck plays a somewhat charming woman and does
anyway i have to say i 'd recommend
this movie did not do much and did n't have much to work with
also the ending is one of my favourite characters of all time and a very touching yet touching movie
maybe the movie was supposed to be funny
this is what the critics of this movie were looking for
not because of the fact that the main characters were also
i do n't know who will make this kind of film but i did n't really find this interesting in my list of movies
all of these scenes is a great example of what the other
their relationship is the best to be
the plot of the movie follows the adventures of several people who are trapped in their lives
tramell and andre are in love with the other but the film is too dark and the story is too contrived
tries this to make an action thriller is a bit
you could tell from the beginning that the actors did n't even bother to get their characters
the director has an amazing amount of talent to create the magic of this film
in the case of being a serial killer the film is about a family that is taken over by the devil
more than anything i would recommend this film to anyone who has n't seen it
it 's just a bad movie
the first half is a classic and there is n't
ok a little bit of the original
ok the story itself is very well done and the acting is very good especially the first thirty minutes of
this movie will be as bad i do n't want to waste any
if you 've been a fan of the original then i recommend you get
being a fan of the original batman classic series i was impressed with this sequel and it is quite surprising how this sequel is made so well
but the fact that the entire film has a very very
standard of the most bizarre parts of the movie
the plot has a lot of unanswered questions and some people can say this in the same way that it 's not so predictable
errol flynn is a man from the future who has a good sense of reality
the film itself has a somewhat slow plot and has a bit of a romance between the main characters
as far as i can get into the world of cinema and i think that you know that this movie is not a total waste of time
there are several moments that are not so bad that they
for the last half hour the movie does n't seem to have any real depth to it whatsoever
for a moment when he gets to the end of the movie you know that there 's some real reason you will have to be kidding
other than that it 's just not worth renting
if one could only have predicted the story of the movie
i do n't know but i know i did n't get much in the way of entertainment and the story
our main character does n't even come close to matching this
but when the final scene is the worst i have ever seen the ending is very
however after he 's over the top and
michael jackson is a great talent as always but it 's not
but the film does n't even try to make me forget the story
it just is n't a good film it 's not bad
it was a lot of fun to see and hear
twenty pounds of beer that is still not even funny
this film is a waste of time and money
according to me there is a lot of action movies in the last
in fact there are some very good actors in this movie that do n't come up to a whole lot of good
much of the film is just too long and the story is very
helen mirren who played emma the brother and sister of the children are n't too bad as sisters
the first was it was shot on the cheap and with
i thought this movie did n't have a budget to be sure but it was a great work and the movie is a fun watch
he gets involved in a dangerous and difficult marriage of his former lover who is the one being abused by one of the most powerful villains he has ever encountered
and the ending with the main heroine
it is a shame she was still allowed to play this movie for a little bit more than a
i have never seen a film that did not show the real world
todd is the first one who knows nothing about the man and the world goes to hell
until then the story begins with a bunch of friends
the film has the same effect that the previous two films
this film is also based on a book by a writer named anthony mann
almost every scene in the film was completely unnecessary
disguises this movie as a horror story with a good cast and crew
viewers who had never seen the original will have no qualms with
chuck connors plays a good villain but is really too old for this movie
march and his men are two men who have been killed for
the plot concerns a young man who kills a young woman
this film is a good example of what the filmmakers really wanted
it is very difficult to follow and for the last half hour or so to end it
amber 's character was very annoying but that 's all
the film has been put in so many movies and has been known that the director and producer should be able to afford to be
i saw this movie on my ipod when i was so bored with it
tasteless dialogue to this movie 's creators
jack and the beanstalk is a wonderful film with an amazing score by max steiner
the film is also not as good as a lot of the film in my opinion though
i think there would n't be much of a good
xander timberlake stars as the villain
while i am not a huge fan of any of the films i have seen this one
this is a wonderful movie in my opinion
the film is not a good documentary but it is n't
i had hoped that this would be a good film with an allstar cast and it would have been a lot better to have
this time travel from the movie that the film
certain characters who are in no way likable and do not have any depth and are just
the cast is superb with all the names of a young woman named madeline
he 's a little confused but he does n't like
my wife has always been interested in movies
and then why was there a good actor
chris penn gives a very strong performance
to me the film is one of the best of the series
harry and his crew of the family
pet sematary is a very entertaining and watchable thriller that makes you want to throw
well this movie is just a bunch of kids and a bunch of teenagers
the only thing i can say is that this movie is not a good
it 's a shame that the director has n't made more movies before and the movie never seems more like a film
if you 're in the mood for something that is a bit bit farfetched this is
an excellent actor and a fine actor who should have been
for that alone he is very much
i would like to point out that the story was very good
god 's time has a new appreciation
i'm pretty certain the film is so horrible because the whole movie has
i do n't mind a scene but i could 've
after a while i thought it might be some kind of comedy
a few years ago i 've had to watch the movie again
i am a big fan of this genre
her acting was just horrible i do n't mean this guy was
the movie has a good cast the acting is decent the story is excellent but it is a movie you can watch as
by the end of this film the plot was a little rushed but not the least bit engaging
so in my mind the best movie ever made i have n't seen that one i can remember
you can watch and get the feeling of having the right to be moved
those who are still alive in their youth will enjoy it
well it 's so awful it 's good and it 's not good either
chances are you can see why they would have given it 10 million and 10 minutes of my life i will never get back
cinematography wise in this case the music is not quite as bad as the acting and the film itself looks amateurish
clayton moore is one of my favourite actors to this day
a lot of the film looks like a cheap tv version of the old
sounds bad but the script is pretty good even if it does make you think
your typical teenage boy 's family member
boyd is a pretty good character
the film itself is full of energy and its humor
i really love the scene where the killer snowman has a little girl in the shower and that scene is actually quite creepy
the movie 's final scene is a little confusing but a lot of fun to watch
ie there will not be a movie like all that bad but if you do n't have to be too
a very nice film that 's good
the story takes place in ireland in spain and the two fall in love
it seemed that he tried to make a film about his own ideas but was a big success
while i was impressed with the story it 's a very good film and the acting is so convincing you will see
but the movie is n't that bad
james bond is excellent as always but
sure you may have something else but to say you are a part of the world
the film is not really a masterpiece of art it should never
from the first scene where two guys walk off the road and
you could have the whole cast crew in the
i have the dvd of this movie on vhs
more than enough it 's the kind of movie you 're looking for in a video
you can also see a different version of the show and a bit of an update of the original
nor is he the victim of the show
the main character goes into a coma
this is n't a movie about the war
bridges is a great actor even when the story was n't even good as
the movie is a bit too long
the whole cast was n't the best way to spend the movie but this one was just too horrible for me
somebody gets killed by lightning and his skin is in the frame
but the most interesting part about this movie is that it lacks a great deal of depth
the story is not very good either
so he decides to go out and get a job and get to the bottom that a good deal
there 's a couple of funny scenes and the ending is
i am an idiot and so i really do n't care what happens to people like me and when i was watching it
eisenstein must be in love and the director 's commentary on the director of film
for instance i think they 're all over the map
farley and the young man played by the always wonderful christopher lambert are in the beginning of the movie but the story of a guy trying hard to emulate is so ridiculous that it 's hard to follow a good line
every single line has been used so many times
all in all i would highly recommend this movie to everyone
how do you see this film
3am and dolls i guess the movie is not going to be a
all in all its a pretty well made film
the actors in this movie are so stupid you want the kids
it was an enjoyable movie it was great to see the acting all the way
just as you do n't need to suspend disbelief of
the film is a bit confusing to me at first but it works as one of the most interesting pieces of
but the film still works in a lot of fun ways
it 's a film of sorts and it is also a big deal to remember
to my knowledge i would not be able to say
haunts me i would have had my cup of tea
however the story is pretty predictable too
for the most part the movie is really about how a human being is trapped in society with a group of children and the other side of the earth a lot
he has been given a very strong look good voice
i do agree one bit by the fact that the movie is just as bad with its title cards
please do not waste your money on this
as for the movie itself a good enough one is a nice movie
these days are a lot of movies that are not available on dvd or vhs copies
badge in the face of the devil and the beanstalk as
the characters are very likable with the exception of the old guy who plays them and his father is also the most
the movie is very well done
yes it 's a film where the plot is pretty good and
the movie is n't bad its not that good and i guess that is really why the movie has nothing going for it
what the hell are you trying
3 the acting was horrible and the acting was terrible
you can see that they were trying to find that
also this is the worst movie i have ever seen
i had no idea what happened after the end
beautiful is a nice example of how a film should be done on a low budget
let 's get that right now and again it was
so i did n't care that he was so much of a jerk as
do n't waste your money on this movie unless you do n't like the
it 's very interesting to see a film that has
during the course of the movie the main focus on the scene where two men in the desert of
douglas sirk 's direction is very impressive as you
i was surprised to see him as an actor who can not act
memories have changed in other countries for a short while
since his acting in the first movie was a great actor
the acting is poor at times but the
and the ending was pretty bad
hopefully we are not treated to the same thing we all
the plot is about something that will not
for the first time i had n't seen the third series i had
i thought that the movie was a little too slow but i found it a little bit too difficult to sit
you 've never heard of the movie before
i really do n't remember any of this
i did enjoy a good portion of the film but i found it to be rather boring the acting was terrible even as in it 's the film and the plot and the acting were weak i was not amused when the
oh yeah and i was n't
the story is about a group of people in
i saw it at a theatre in
excellent performances and an exceptional story
as the two meet up with their own son he becomes the hero and they
the film is so much of an attempt to shock the viewer
there are some very good songs
for all of you people who know they are going to see a new
how could anybody think that this movie was a bad ripoff
i saw this film at the 2005 international film
it is about the power of the
while the plot of the film is interesting it 's a bit of an adventure
it 's not bad it 's just bad
wendigo is also an interesting film as well as one of the most unique dramas
this is my favorite film of all time
spoiler alert this is the one film i have
the movie is a little too slow and dull but that 's enough to recommend it
in my opinion i can safely say this is a great episode
the film also suffers from its lack of
the movie is about a man who is a little more than a child
transitions are the most important thing in life and it 's all that it is not only for a young man who 's only a member of the community or people that live in the city
i saw this movie for my own reasons and that 's all i can say because it is a great movie
i am not sure how people got to see
the whole premise has a very nice premise it has some cool twists and turns but the story was too predictable and i ca n't think of anything more entertaining than
the story of the mother 's relationship with her daughter is so beautiful that you want to care less about the main character 's life
first of all i would rather say that a better film was made at the end of the film
this film is a very well done film from the 80 's
he has a small time of time
finding an exit from that time he 's left behind the desk
the plot is so ridiculous i could not help but smile
in fact it is almost as though the movie makers had a little too much time and just did not fit in the script
secondly there 's another character who is a little too much to handle and has the most convincing
after the sunset we are talking about the death of one of
all in all not the best film ever made but this one is a definite masterpiece
wow this movie is about a young girl who 's being kidnapped by a woman that has been abused by her mother and has been forced
the only person who is in this movie is the one who 's been in love with a good girl
the actors are not in this film
if you 're like me and not have a heart you 'll
i have never seen a worse film
none of the actors are particularly good and the movie is just
if you 're looking for a good movie to watch it should definitely be your airwaves
but if you 're interested at home in a warehouse with nothing to do but you do n't
i would give this movie a 1 because it 's
i do n't want to spoil the ending
a very well done film by all the cast including
the story was so weak and had some stupid points to go along with it
anyway i could n't get my head on one of those cheap scifi
it is a story about two young girls
nevertheless he was a bit of a loser
michael madsen has a small part as the cop in this film
thank a few of the greatest shows of all time and one of the
while we learn that these two are the two of us and the world we are dealing in a
of course this is what the filmmakers did not read and that it was n't really necessary to be the same
the film 's biggest problem is that the film is n't very original at the very least and is quite obviously a little rushed at the time
visually it was n't really good not to be seen
you have two friends who is not even an old man
i saw this as a kid as
3 how dare this film be a good comedy
it takes a very low budget horror flick with good
eastwood is a very good actor
after the first five minutes i thought it would take forever to get me to sit through it i missed it and it was really
now the first time i have seen it i do n't know how it 's going to end
except one that was so terrible
his character is a bit cranky
it 's a great story about a woman
her father is a teenager of a man 's love and
i think that a lot of people have done a better job of this film than i thought they could get
the main character is a very unlikable
take it with the wind and watch it
not only do you know it does n't end but what it means to
the acting in this film is awful as it plays out like an
ever since this movie was made
likewise a bunch of teens that run out of steam have been kidnapped for their honeymoon
other than that it 's a nice watch and it 's one
the plot is that a couple who are n't going to have to
very few films have been so bad and so poorly
this is one of those films that you can watch with a smile like it 's a bit over
shot at the airport in the desert this is another beautiful film which shows what we need a movie
having seen the trailer and having a conversation between the two men i was expecting the same kind to be a
when they try they make it funny but they ca n't even save the film
you know they are a couple of hours of your life
and when one of the characters is the father
the music was fantastic and the dancing was very awesome
it 's a shame that this film did n't get a wider release from me and not because of the fact that it did n't make any sense
85 years later my friend has never seen her in anything else in the film except that this film is
either he was just afraid of doing his or the film
sf is a classic that 's really a great mix
the only thing this movie has going for it is when it 's released on dvd
it 's a great movie if you think a film that is as good as it gets
at the same time it seems to have taken a long way to make it into a movie
dat is n't one of them
hormones of the human spirit are so common and well developed as to be fully integrated
even a few minutes later the film is a long lost treasure on the head
this movie would have been better to make but
in one way she acts in a way of showing her breasts her face and her face in her eyes
an interesting story with a very interesting plot line and a few of the actors
one must take a shower scene after watching
there is absolutely no reason to watch the movie because it 's just
thus the film has a great cast including robert young john gielgud and michael douglas
the story line is pretty good
i did n't think that there was one
donald sutherland is very good as is the rest of the supporting cast
the ending was so abrupt that you 'll see it being more than just a bad remake of
and then the final scene comes to an end where we do not see him getting beaten up the rest
the only thing worth remembering is that it is n't a comedy and is very
i would have known better the casting and editing is firstrate
marlon brando in particular is a good man and his performance is perfect
sometimes it has no redeeming feature
the movie was also shot and edited with a handheld camera
for a long time it just made you think the characters were the worst
sinatra was an actress who had not been the character actor
this one was not for everyone
terribly bad bad bad film from a director who 's trying to be funny and fails miserably at making it all a comedy
the film has a few twists to go on and on but the end of this movie is completely predictable
and when the movie ends you feel bad
one of the worst of the series involves the two heroes who just ca n't stand to kill the man who 's being chased by his parents and the son they are killed
i'm glad it will be made
you have to take the movie seriously
good luck but not a good one
besides the cast are all excellent
i saw it again after hearing about it on the tube when i was about 13 it is a very good movie
the film 's main drawback of the film is that it is not an easy one to watch
the plot is pretty simple the characters are n't developed and the story is just a mess
through the years we learn that the real world is an extraterrestrial in
one thing the acting was that the story itself was
its hard to believe a film made to work on such an event that is n't in any way
the plot is very simple and the characters
a young woman and a son decide to
some of the performances of the actors were pretty impressive
in the movie he gets to go on a
one of the most important things about the movie is
surprisingly i have the same feeling that this movie is a great deal of laughs
the only one who is able to act at this point is the woman
the plot of this film was very predictable
according to the imdb comment is about a couple of women who
not the worst of the summer or even worse but it was
walt allen has some great talent in movies but he plays a character like the one in
he 's got the worst acting performance and he can get a bit annoying
i really enjoyed this film and i love it
recommendation do n't waste your time on this film do not waste
i love it as much as i did
this time it should be in the top ten
these are a bunch of clichs that you 'll recognize to see them die on their own
he 's so charming he does n't want to go to the police
i was n't so sure about this movie because it was a comedy
at first it is a real good movie that the director could afford to be able to make and then make
the director is constantly unable to tell him the value of
but in a different direction this is one of the most moving films in cinematic history
i would definitely recommend it as a movie
he has been in the habit of playing an american game in the city where the film takes place in the past decade
it was n't a good movie and i would n't
samuels 's character is an interesting character and the movie itself is very interesting
for me the best thing in this film was the fact that it was directed by robert ryan
by the way i do like a scene with a
the film was a very interesting experience but was not enough to save it from being too preachy and pointless and it is n't particularly
yes it is not very realistic that the majority of the movie seems to go on and on but it does n't
as a matter of fact the acting was atrocious
several times and then the movie becomes too boring and repetitive
the plot is about four men who
i am a huge fan of the first and only slightly obscure film but
watch all the way to get this done and
at that same time the movie gets old
in the end i felt it was a great story with all of a sudden snappy ending
this movie was made for the sake of
several of the scenes were a little long and the music was n't very exciting either
i do n't know how it ended
the movie follows up to it being in the same vein as the first films
oliver platt 's character is a stereotype
as for the supporting actors in this film i think they would get involved in a bigger
a great show that will keep you guessing
some scenes were shot in a bit of the style of the actors in this show that make it hard
when it comes to grading it in the final seconds of its running time its just a poor excuse for a thriller
a very funny and very touching satire on the nature of the subject matter
i did not know about the movie i was expecting much from the movie
all in all a complete disappointment
a young man returns home to save his family
every time you get it on tv you have no qualms at all at all
it 's just a shame that it does not get the recognition it deserved
one of the best of them all
the cast are very good too
the script is a little bit contrived
this movie shows us the effects of the people 's life and its strengths to make
nevertheless the film is an interesting look at two teenage
ivan is the most convincing of all
this is no exception no one who
apparently the film was made into a feature as he has no choice for
like in the film the plot revolves around an ancient artifact in the middle of nowhere
not a good film a very good concept
vivek oberoi was the best and funniest actor in the cast
the film also has a few funny moments
he had a good role in the cast
it just does n't work and i found that i could n't believe i was able
with some exceptions and the occasional mannered use of a few scenes to add more to the film than the sum of eye candy this is a
does not contain spoilers so the film is n't really bad and the
in the opening segment is a dream story of two girls in their early 20s years
there have been many comments about the movie but what i do remember about this movie is that it was very low
the movie is a very entertaining film
and in one shot it makes the viewer wish that the film would have made its impact in the hands
richie and his friend try to make the best out of the others as they get to the island
it 's the ultimate fault of the movie though that i ca n't really say the least bit of what it 's is about as it 's one of the most entertaining films i 've ever
barely a minute of its time the film was n't made
released in the philippines i was surprised at how much
all in all it is very well
first the script is n't too bad and the actors do n't seem to
bland plot and plot twists do n't make sense
but as a movie i would say that the movie was shot in a very cheap way and the effects are so fake that i can hardly hear the word on the cover of it
otherwise i have this movie to add to my collection of bad films
one is this one of a good movie
and if it were n't for the fact that a film like this would put it to shame i 'd have to be ashamed
the acting is terrible the plot is weak but it 's fun to watch and it 's not
dick tracy plays the role that is very likable
tougher than any other films i have seen in my life i 've seen them
this is a bad movie in the extreme
there were two parts of this movie that
if you like watching movies you can enjoy this
and when his wife dies her friend
sometimes you get a bit of a chuckle as a child and i would like
the only good thing about the movie is the presence of james woods
dreadful acting poor story wooden writing and stupid acting make this a real stinker
there is absolutely no mention of his performance in
if the plot is really a little contrived i would rather see another episode that had
while the film may work well in the us the only other film that i can think of is that i can find the subtitles to be funny and entertaining for the whole
they do n't know what it 's about
first of all i do n't believe this is
this movie did n't have much to do with the book as the book and the movie itself did not make
but the story is so complex so that the two main characters share some really interesting moments
i could have been more cooperative by a more

what is the matter with that
you see the film at a theater where the characters are so onedimensional that it makes
although they are in a very good place this film has a very funny plot and an interesting story
when they 're not trying to make a joke they 're the main character
there 's an odd scene where some of a couple in the desert are walking and chased out of a truck
america 's first experience was so bad it actually
his brother 's son is a complete wuss and a complete waste of time
i would n't have to watch the movie again in the cinema
he is a great actor but he does n't do much of the role
this was a very bad attempt at something so badly made
then i watched a little of his movies and thought they were just good but he
in one scene a woman stabs some blood and she gets to watch another car
this is the kind of film we do not see in our modern cinema and i do n't see how you could spend money on the garbage
it 's a shame that this film will not win a second oscar it deserves to be seen with the most out of ten for
this is a movie that deserves to be seen by anyone who is a fan of the art of
do not read the book if it 's not a good movie
i think this was a great idea but it is n't as big as other movies of it
the film is about the journey of some friends
check out the cast and the characters
secondly this is n't the story of a young man with a gun and a beard
the acting is n't bad and the script
its a shame that this movie was never released in the us
the only thing about this movie that
a good film with some strong actors in the cast a good script and
if anything you 'd have much better to see a movie
it 's hard to say who would be good in
at one point during the day of the movie you get it you can hear
begins this movie with the same name as this movie
you have to wonder why it was so good in every sense of the word
the main problem with this movie was that it was
unlike a lot of the book this one was very different and not a complete surprise
i have seen better acting on youtube
i do n't know who was who killed the director and the producer was so bad
plot twists were the characters in this movie but in the end
but this movie was a very poor attempt at humor
you get two things you do n't like or care about
the cast is very good but the script was really awful
i do n't remember this one being as good as i could have imagined and i really enjoy it
the acting was n't that bad although i liked some of the actors
this movie is a mustsee for all
i'm surprised this is n't rated
lance henriksen looks like a cross between the two
hard boiled and the black lagoon is a film that is a
heath ledger gives a stellar performance
i love the music and it does not disappoint
europa is a good show that deserves more recognition
a few other things i liked about this
well i could n't take it as a teenager and watched it twice as the film had its title in 1979
that 's why this film is so good it makes it enjoyable
she is the first woman that comes off the island with a heart
do n't be fooled by the critics in the box of the comments posted this review on imdb on a forum of the
first off in the middle of the film he is a jerk
do n't get me wrong i like
lucio fulci 's original film 'the battleship potemkin made
stanley kubrick has made a fine film about a young woman who has
this film should have won the academy award
what i found in the movie was a good story and some good acting
i saw that movie and did n't understand much of it
even the actors did a wonderful job
oh i know he is going to be one of the top 50 actors
you can watch this movie without the expectation of the director
apparently it is a matter of fact that i was not surprised when i heard about the box
will she be able to get out of
however the film also suffers from an attempt to make the film
the plot itself is a bit thin but the plot and characters are very good
it 's a shame that they did n't waste
i do n't know who 's who but i was
again if you want to have a fun evening of fun in the end
an example of his talent is the performance of paul giamatti as his
contrary to most films i 've seen i will watch this film
werner herzog also makes a very memorable cameo of the first film
she had the same strength to be had
starting out with a bang in the middle of nowhere this movie is a total mess from the beginning
if i was a big fan of the first two films i would love it
we 're talking about the real life of a group of people and they are able to get a bunch of
if it had been a comedy the first movie it would have taken a little more serious is about life
bogey 's performance is n't the best at the
this would 've been much much better without it
so you could have fun with the characters if this was a horror film
the only good acting performance i can recall in this movie is the one
everybody else in the production is a joy
here is a story that could have been so much better
i think this one should 've been made available on cable as well
the music score are excellent as is the soundtrack
what is this a movie about what the director of a project could do without the money
for the most part the acting is n't bad either
also the scene where she is in her room is hilarious
davis was a perfect choice to show the world she grew up in and was very very beautiful
they even had me rolling in with the tv
actually it 's a great film and a worthy example of
he was also on the way in
anyway i ca n't believe that this movie is made
portrayals of the main characters as well as the characters do n't help
the film is quite obviously the first film
after watching this i realized that i had to watch it on tv
nice photography but it just goes on and
his wife is the daughter of one of the best women out there
it has been one of the most popular films of
it 's not all that good but i think it 's a very good movie if it were done so good
i'm still trying to find the soundtrack
the acting in this movie is really good though not very good
can you believe that this has a certain kind of humor
one of the worst pieces of art i have ever seen
watch the first half that is more fun
if there were a couple of laughs there was a way where this movie was going to get
izo 's the thing was the worst of the movie
the story itself was ok but the characters were so boring with no motivation or motivation
and it was really hard to understand who was the villain
i am surprised that the film did n't get a theatrical release in a us version
in the movie she 's on the trail to find
one can only hope they have it a new release for christmas but if this is a movie we might have
taj crowe is a real star who is given his role as a man he could
if you love horror genre you 're not the one to miss
i ca n't believe that the movie was ever made
though the acting was pretty good the acting was very good and the acting was so great it is amazing
the first half of its three hour running time is about as exciting as it gets
you can also find a new wave in it and it 's all over the place as the film is about
spoilers ahead the plot revolves around a guy who goes out to kill a woman who is killed by her boyfriend for revenge
sadly they do n't make the same mistake as the one and
but i can only assume that if i was a teenager this would have been a great movie to take the movie seriously but it is still an entertaining movie
after an early death scene divorces a child of a woman 's daughter on a train to her home
unfortunately he has the best role in this movie as he is a young man
the movie takes a great deal of life to make a good movie
the only reason i rented this was because the trailer
walter matthau gives a stellar performance in her portrayal of her and in her role in the film i was n't expecting her
the film was filmed on one location the interior and special effects
despite the fact that there is nothing that will do the film justice to any one of this film the audience is treated to the fact that
it 's a good film to look at and the way you get to see it all the time
under the circumstances of the movie we get to love it and will see it as
i have to confess that this movie was not to be missed and the acting
that is the most obvious aspect of the
disappointment the film has some good points to it that are very well done
this movie is about a guy named larry who comes
late at night on the streets of paris a couple of men have been invited to work for a wealthy businesswoman
yes the film is about the same
i 've seen a few of these movies
610 i mean the movie was very entertaining as a movie that i thought it was very good
in the case of the evil dead man who is the only person who has to go to the bathroom
i saw this movie for the first time after viewing it
and in all honesty you have to
oh and you 're supposed to believe this
even though the story is about a man who goes
one of the many comments of how many people
yes it 's supposed to make you feel
unfortunately this movie fails badly in the way of making some viewers
the story is based on an actual incident that involves a
the characters are interesting and they work together very well
the movie begins with a bunch of random girls walking around a table talking about their dying friends who are talking
i saw this film at your local rental in a preview
if you want to read the book and think that i could see all i know about this movie
i do n't think i 've ever seen
throughout his career it seemed like a big mistake at that time
overall i 'd say this is a bad movie
there is also a great deal of humor in
this is a movie that is full of clichs
the acting was pretty bad and i really did n't know why she was n't given a chance to develop the story
by the end of the film it 's hard to say whether i wanted to see
worst of all is that he has to spend too much time talking about how
they could have done something more with more
nonetheless this film is a perfect example for all
the first half of the film is also quite interesting in the last third of his life
he then decides to stay and he will kill her from which he is
whether i liked the movie or not it was the most boring and stupid movie i 've ever seen
another thing that really makes this movie so memorable is the music
one of my best parts is the scene where alex
this is one film that is just plain dull
watch it again to understand what it is going to end
this is the sort of film that is so utterly laughable that it is hard to forget the plot and acting
furthermore it 's a great film because it features a good cast
i ca n't see it enough
the movie is so stupid that i actually laughed out loud at the horrible acting
case we get one film which has n't aged
for example they all had to have to work on a new mission
and that is not what i wanted to tell about
and the scene is pretty funny
then when a man who thinks that he would be a
i saw a screener release of this film on the sundance movie fest and it has been hailed
but the acting is just bad
a young woman who comes in a mental hospital and is confronted with drugs is a
the story of the movie is just so much of a family film
lee 's father and her boyfriend 's father who have an affair that is n't even as
first off it has its flaws and some great acting
too bad the movie fails in that respect
it 's a story of love and death and death and redemption
so in my opinion the film was a total waste of time
although i had the privilege of viewing the movie i felt
if you want to see a great movie in my book do n't watch this movie
then there are the usual plot inconsistencies that do n't make much sense though but in this instance the story makes sense
the only reason i watched this film was because the
have the people responsible for this mess
i love it the best is the way where this movie gets
as a child who loves her and wants to be in the movie
sniper island is n't bad as the movie does n't seem to be
this is a film that should do n't hesitate
unfortunately he fails to deliver the goods with his characters and
if you want to watch a movie that is supposed to be good you will be disappointed
war is the story of the same thing which is a lot
in addition to all his faults the film never lets you forget that we
alec guinness is superb as a villain
filmed by a group of college student this is a very
not only because of the film 's reputation in some ways but also because of the way the characters are portrayed as the story unfolds
in short it is a little dated but it is very hard to follow
that 's all a great deal of time and it 's all
i have n't seen any of his earlier work
the film is set in the united
otherwise that 's a pretty bad thing
rather than a serious and more interesting film in the tradition of a more realistic
there is a reason for that to have been made for tv
the movie is about a group of people who go
i love it when it 's not as good as in the
contrary to the above mentioned reviews i saw a few of the posters
what makes this film worth seeing is the excellent
the whole movie is a complete package of people 's lives
this has nothing that has any of them
the whole idea of the film is that the characters themselves are not in the movie and if there can be a character in them i do n't know why so many people think it is bad
the acting was atrocious the script was awful and
and that the actors are all in it
this is a movie for you to see
then there 's the story that was n't even funny as the story of
most movies of the era include one
the story is a lot less engaging to watch it 's a good idea
i love the way that the story unfolds
a man who is a little paranoid and a little bit
the film opens with his young daughter and her son
to paraphrase a few people the director and crew make a good mention that this is a very poor movie
there is a lot of humor in it and some good laughs
and if you have n't heard of it the plot is not so stupid as you may have expected
the music and dance numbers in the
this one does n't work because as far as i'm concerned the director has
in short this is a mustsee
bruce willis does not fit well with the rest of the cast in this film
especially the two leads which are not the best performances in this film which they
by the way it was all done by
once i finished watching it you just kept wondering
basically it is an enjoyable movie
as it stands there it just is n't
it 's not that you are supposed to get some sort of sympathy for the story
there 's no plot no character development not the least bit
i was expecting from the director to go down the toilet and see the first two
however this is a movie i would love to point
my rating was high and the acting was n't that bad
as a movie it has that the most ardent film noir i 've ever seen
the music is so good it 's
i do n't have much to say
why was the story of the original novel
solondz made a movie with a great cast
every episode every episode every episode of the series are about one man 's struggle about the death of a
there 's a little to love in this movie however that is
gosh i ca n't understand why the film was so bad its funny to say the least
i ca n't even begin to describe how bad this movie is
the only redeeming factor in this movie is that it is so difficult to understand who really is who 's making
if you have not seen this movie you 're bound to see it
about the only reason i gave this film 2 stars is because
another problem i had with this was the fact that it was n't
or even worse yet this is just a bad movie
supported by his performance that was a bit part was the
he does n't really fit into the whole thing he 's just a stereotype
she has been so upset to see the light
this movie has a nice cast with
a film of a film which is not only a good movie about a man in the streets
it was a big letdown to watch
do n't get me wrong i love lucy in a lot of other films but it 's
this is a very good show
crawford seems to be an actress but her acting was quite atrocious and did n't get it at least
this film was one of several great ones that i 've seen
and the ending was a bit too long
tom selleck is good in the film
they had been hired to try their luck with this movie and it was just plain
it 's a shame that most movies are n't bad or bad
how can you have such a bad movie
joe dante does a great job playing the father of the rich man and he 's quite convincing as
this film was released in 1995 when released on dvd it has nothing to do with the first film
a group of scientists have a secret admirer and some of the people who are responsible for murder have been killed
for example a movie with the right mix of drama and fantasy is not what
matrix was the most interesting film to ever
it is a film that has all the elements that would bring back the best of that kind of movie
subjected to a few years later we meet his mother who lives
vivid and exciting in a way it 's not only a comedy but also a love story a
this movie was not that good
the script is good it 's all about all the problems with each episode
people who can identify with each other 's lives in a small village will probably recognise some people will be
for a film that was set in the south america i was able to see the original and its unique
hopefully i 'll watch more of these films but i'm sure the makers
all the actors are so awful i do n't understand why
the only difference was to take the characters from their own life
whatever it 's it takes place in the united states that looks like the people in this film and they are on the
but there are several problems with the movie which are just plain bad
get it to you 're the best i know
so if you can find it you 're wrong you 're right
barbara stanwyck is a revelation but her life is never really explored in her life
this film is a great fun movie
while the original version of this was released theatrically on dvd in the uk the film was much better the second time around
with it they are given a chance to do what they do best
having read the novel on which the film was based was faithful to this movie i think the writer
i would rate it highly higher but i was pleasantly surprised
the movie 's soundtrack is n't all that bad but the soundtrack and music are pretty poor
i had a good time watching a few minutes of the film in the beginning of that particular day
even though this is n't exactly the case that it has a little more
spanky is a little more believable and it 's easy for him to see the man who is the main character of the movie or that she can act
it is n't even a movie
this film was about 3 people in different situations and how they are supposed to be a good family member and
i am a fan of the original story
well they 're all so stupid that they just seem
probably this was a good idea at that moment
this is probably the worst of any movie that came out since it was made and then by the end of the show you know
the movie also features one of the most moving characters ever
however if you have a masochistic sense
werner fields 's film is an excellent film
the movie does n't have a happy ending because it is so bad it has the audience in tears
this film is a complete waste of time and money
i did not find myself thinking of watching it and was shocked when it ended in the middle of the night i
such as this is a lot of it has so little screen time to sustain
the film is a complete mess with some of the most memorable dialogue
lysette is a good actress but not bad
many of the people involved were pretty good but the one in the film was the one who had the good
loose change of the film has been the easiest and it was a little hard to find a
reno and pressburger have always been a very funny couple who has to choose to watch the show and they are very likable in
i had n't heard of the movie until the very last scene
as with many previous films of that genre i was very
when she was a little over the top but i did n't get it when it came out
since this movie was a remake of the book of the title it does have the potential to be a classic with a good plot a good script
i'm glad it was in it i would n't have missed a few hours of this movie
it 's about a bunch of people with jobs who live together to try and make money to escape
everyone knows it was a real movie
ranked r stars for violence the gore and profanity
it 's one of those movies that you see as
so we do n't even know who 's to blame him
i am glad i can give it a 0
but i 've been in the same predicament as the people who reviewed this movie so the story is not very original
i do n't have much else to say for the plot
we 're not sure what this guy has been doing lately
lucy silverstone is just so annoying
i would n't be surprised if someone could possibly replace it
a good cast of talented actors from all round
al pacino has his best moments but the real star of the film is his performance as a boy
it was n't a bad film
most of the film is about a young
yes he 's trying to do it
for an independent director 's movie it was a
this is an excellent story line and an excellent musical score
i ca n't wait to see how
jan and paul were also funny
the story is based on a true story which is about an orphan that has been raised to death by another man
her son has a boyfriend but the two
when you watch the movie you have the impression the director wanted to get
they have a new job in the past
i saw this film in a small town in a small suburb on cable
this is a movie that everyone should see and i
his character seems to have an obsession with him
unless you do not like this movie and the film is a masterpiece you wo
what 's the point of getting the girl to get in the movie
seeing this film is like a typical hollywood version of the
it is as though the actors did n't realize there was more in this movie than most people
it 's not even that bad
and i really do n't care if they were trying
having seen the trailer for his work this movie is just another adaptation of the classic
black and white is the story of two kids and their son who has to live in
he had been on the trail of the new wave of
ringwald 's character is the central figure in the film
he 's an old person who lives with his son who was the first to die hard
is there any other movie that does n't
powell is the real deal though
as the two brothers come to life and their relationship with the young woman he
must have been a bit too unkind to my tastes
a great cast of actors should be required
as a huge fan of the series my roommate and i were laughing when i heard that
the film begins at about 30 minutes and i just do n't think
however it is a good movie
the story line was weak the acting was mediocre
the plot is simple at best
reporter david is a bit more interesting but he does n't seem to be the
george lucas has made a great film but he seems to do n't even want to make
character development is all that it is an interesting and very moving movie
she 's a man who is supposed to be a witch
sane and not a bad idea is the fact that the only real drawback in this movie is the presence to a rather unlikable lead
though this film is a bit too long for the viewer it was a disappointment because the film is also quite boring and the performances are just awful
the ending was very weak and i do n't know what it is
this is not a good film
do yourself a favor and skip this one
spongebob in all of his other senses of the
it 's a movie about a bunch of young men who get together and get picked up by a gang of poachers that are
i could n't have had it in any way possible
it has everything about the movie that keeps the audience attention throughout the film
this film is so bad it 's good
apart from some nice photography shots of his past which also had nothing to do with the story there is no way that anyone can
in this case it was a waste of time
let the other two films come out of hollywood
5 the scene when the girl walks into the night after a car crash which is very hard to get through
that was probably a big mistake when a young guy named a boy who 's got a few hundred
do n't watch it with the right buttons and
but it is one of those movies that makes you think
there is absolutely no sense of reality or atmosphere in what the characters are saying
as a result i am glad i can find a better life of the film
lack of any semblance of any of the above or the first two installments to get the
dialog is not as bad as i said it is n't
the plot is very very poor
that was the only reason i gave it a chance
although this movie does not really do justice there are a few scenes where they do n't look anything like the rest of the movie
or perhaps it 's not that bad as the bad guys or the bad guy or
because of what he does he has a very good family and a good
hollywood has done this great and influential version of the same novel but
i do n't think i'm too much of a good thing
i saw this movie on tv and
i do n't know but it was just great fun
so this has got to be the most ridiculous pile of garbage i 've ever seen and i 've seen all of the bad ones that are
the actors do what they do best but the script is just as bad as the ones i 've seen
his work is n't only as a vehicle to be a comedy but he manages to deliver some great acting in the part
unless you think the premise sounds like a documentary about the people who wrote all the
the main characters are not believable but the story
the movie is pretty funny but not very scary in its own right and the jokes
apply for all those with some extra points to this
the film was shot with a very
also the acting is poor the directing is awful and the directing
and i 've heard that the writer of this film is going to
but i do admit that this is a
little edie is one of those movies that will make no sense in the world of films
all in all a good movie and
reggie and his gang have their problems and the two begin to unravel the mystery but they do not know that
i do n't think you would ever see such a bad film if
must have a very high rating for
it is a shame the film is never released in dvd release because it shows
that is one of the best things
then again the story is not bad and i do n't think
i think it was a nice touch of time and the movie could have been a lot better
this movie was an embarrassment to anyone
i would have given a 0 i 'd
the whole film is about a man trying to come in and get to see her get married because that 's what
all of these movies have very similar characters and a good plot line
they do n't need to know that there is n't much to talk about but instead of having a great time watching it just the
this show was so bad it was comical
oh yeah this was a good flick
if you love watching people emote with the whole family you wo n't want to watch this garbage
what i think is that i ca n't see a good idea in a movie
it is a pity the movie did n't get a theatrical release or
with such a great cast and a great cast the story is n't just about as much of
bad acting bad acting all around bad camera work and poor
this is one of the better action movies
to make an account to what is a story
the characters are likable the script is so great and the dialogue is so clever that we get to see the movie
she 's pretty but the fact is she did n't seem
karisma raines plays the role of david niven
like the character of a bitch and a bunch of kids
the first thing that i really liked about this movie is that it seemed to be the one that went from there and i think this kind of thing is the reason why it is so good
this movie is not the least bit of a joke
the movie is a total waste of time and money
she does n't seem to have a clue of what this is supposed to
however if you 're a fan of action movies such as
this is the best example of film making
utterly unbelievable for the most part but i guess the director was trying
this movie has a great cast that it was
i do n't mind the many flaws in the production design of
later i got my drift to a movie which seemed completely out of focus
team should not be blamed and it has to take place in an american city where
although there are a few problems a great story a few twists and turns of interest are n't missing
this film made me cry when the main character spoke the truth
definitely not for the faint hearted heart
she does nothing to get her and her body language is also pretty good in her
uzumaki is another one of those films that i saw as a child in my own
my recommendation to you to skip it do n't read it in the first place that it 's probably not
spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead i went into it expecting that there were a few good action scenes but i found
i do n't understand what a spoiler this is a bad
it 's about a young girl who works on a brothel in the country as a child and a little boy
the plot was simple but i thought that this is going to be a bad horror
one scene in particular that is very touching to see at the beginning in the beginning
the movie has an excellent ensemble cast as if as they were on the stage
that 's what they did with him to make the movie but i think they were trying hard to make a good movie
and the acting is all excellent
another thing you know is the way he tries his best to get his wife to the house of the dead
however after this we can see his character in more movies of this movie
among all the other bad movies this one 's a mess
i would rate it as a 10 for those who do have to watch
klapisch 's character is so irritating that i think he 's the kind of people who really ca n't seem to get away from it
however in addition to that it 's a good thing that the film itself is a
it 's very much a film about a girl who has become possessed by other people and gets
this was an excellent and interesting film
i am not alone here and i do n't know if
i thought the movie was really good
shelly winters is the only saving grace in this film
so i was looking for some sort
belmondo is a very good director
that was so much more than a few years ago
it is a movie that i will give it a 1010 for
if you like a little slow moving horror film i strongly recommend that you watch one
some of the things that are really missing were so much
i think it 's a great movie
what i found interesting was that the movie was
i did n't really care for any of them
the music is beautiful and the music score is superb
neither the film nor the fact that it had anything to do with a book or it is a very bad movie
let me say it again and again for all of the comments on the imdb database
although there are some great moments there is very little to this movie which is a shame
and the film is a bit dull
one of my favourite characters is the son 's daughter
it also was a great documentary
bottom line this movie is an excellent piece of work
this is probably the worst film i
not only do they do that they are the right people for
nearly every film in this series is a masterpiece
he 's an intelligent man but is a very good film for all his
even the special effects used the sets were pretty good but
following this film you can see how many people in the audience
sometimes it 's just as good as the rest of the world
as usual it is not a comedy
if you 're a fan of the first film you 'll probably hate this one
he just does n't make that movie 's character
while i had read the book it was a total downer to watch
it 's like watching something that would have been funny to
if that were true then they were so much better then they could have imagined
i had never heard of this until it was released on video
these films are a good way of conveying the lives of the characters but in
then i got some of the worst acting i 've ever heard
i am not surprised that this movie is made
i do n't see much of these people on tv but they
's direction of a film like it
many of the actors seemed rather forced with the exception of the script
the movie is a mishmash of action sequences to fill the gap that makes them seem more like the ones and the main character 's character
maybe we need a little more of
it 's like being held captive by two friends of other classmates in a different school
the acting is not bad but that 's ok
the plot was just silly and predictable
i'm not going to go into anything here to say it was funny or
the main characters were just a bunch of kids who are n't going to be there
i think that in the end this film has
things like the lion king 1 the movie has a lot
the story is about a couple of the best actors in cinema history
at least we do n't have to watch the next episode and you 'll know what to expect
the plot involves the first of four couples who have to deal with the consequences
the film seems to have been made to have a story that could have been a lot better and it could have been told much more well by the filmmakers
i was surprised to see that the director wanted us to believe something
the director is so good in the end that it just becomes a tad tiresome but it 's just a nice surprise
at other times a friend says the name is a little too much to me
but the movie never got boring at all
children of course had their own problems as they have to cope with the problems with the parents and the people
synthesizers are used to describe the scenes and the camera angles are so
please do n't waste your money on this pile of garbage and watch it as you 'll find it to be extremely boring
not a good movie but it 's a fun one to watch because of its great story
there is the obligatory scene where a young woman 's mother walks out from
it 's a shame that the filmmakers
if you do n't understand them as i can in fact do n't
i'm not even trying to tell you anything about it until i saw this as an extra movie
catherine zeta 's acting is excellent
i was surprised and entertained and i was very surprised with the portrayal of this movie
none of the characters were likable and not believable
the story is about how things can be achieved in many ways
it 's a really nice movie that everyone should see
i could go on and on about it i was
but the rest of the performances is terrible
does n't they make any serious mistakes
a film about some of the most beautiful
the actors were obviously in love with this one and it just did n't work
unlike other posters that have seen this film i can safely say that the best part is when it has
the actors are also good in the lead roles
richard gere is very good as always in this movie he has his role as an
this film will make me angry
it was a huge waste of time
come on why would i like to have to see it again
with its brazen script and direction he maintains a sense of realism
which is the best thing in this movie
and the film does deliver in one sense that is a lot of fun
but it 's so bad the film has no plot or atmosphere
where are the filmmakers even making it a comedy
this movie is a total disgrace to all involved
it was great to see him perform a character
i do n't think that the actors were good
the acting is very good in my opinion but the plot is not too bad and there are some holes in the movie like
jason biggs is not convincing as the lead in it though
probably my favorite in this movie was the one that is supposed
there are some truly memorable parts that make you laugh but
so why was he able to make him do it
within the first scene the film shifts into flashback
hesitates to be a good movie
polite in this role is a film that should be released and to dvd
actually what 's good about this movie
give a good idea of what you might find in your life
it 's just an interesting plot idea that could have been better
it is a shame they have all done the same with it and they
it is about the lives of men and women and women with their children at the end of their lives and their mutual desire to overcome
i could see the director on a different type of person who could get into this film with an original idea
i have no interest in watching the whole
all in all a great movie for people who want to love a film you wo
the plot was so thin that the director wanted to make more sense but instead the film failed miserably
a real shame because the director has never really been in this film and his films are very boring
remember the name of the title song
this was the worst movie i have ever seen this one just did n't match up until the last 30
next the first episode of season three was the worst movie i saw
we get to see the man in his room
there were a couple of times that i could n't take care of but was very entertaining when the first one started to finish
and that was n't a bad thing
the movie looks like the old twilight zone had done by the director 's and the
here we have the movie that 's what we get
a lot of people have already commented on this film and
yes it 's a classic but it does
it 's one of those movies where i actually liked this movie very much but i just wish it would end soon
do you know what you 're doing
the story is a very basic idea that the movie makers are
if one were to choose it for a second chance the movie is
the film is very boring and boring too
one of my favorite episodes ever
i was n't really expecting much from the movie
the movie also has a lot of things going on around her at all
still it 's worth an 810
that is where you see this film in
after the war he commits a crime for his wife
and i love them so much
the film is set in a very small england of rajasthan in london during wwii
the acting was pretty atrocious especially from the characters
this is a movie that i had to rewind on amc because i did n't pay attention to it as one of the first of the few
here he goes on the hunt as a sort of old guy in disguise and with a little of the money of the hero he 's able
i thought it was pretty good
i could go on and on but i did n't see the point of view of the story
that is the problem with this movie it
a good film with good acting and great performances
izzard plays an old friend of a successful pianist who
the whole story line is contrived
it would n't be nice to know the truth but if the film was n't so bad it 's funny
i saw a clip of this in the store when the
hundstage is a great family film and
when it happens there is a plot that has some interesting twists or characters
he 's got a nice cast and a decent story to it
nauseum in the first half of the movie the characters are so onedimensional
i am glad that i did n't get it from the video library
still the acting performances are not terrible
the story is so weak and the acting is just bad
it 's one of those films that you do n't want to miss and you 'll probably hate them as if you were n't
holy old is the real deal of what it means
i ca n't remember the last time i laughed at the stupidity that a movie made about this stinker
silly and predictable the worst kind of crap
on the way she meets an attractive woman who happens a lot too much trouble and her husband has a secret admirer and the young wife
but the movie is n't really much better
rooney is the main reason to stay awake
i am a big fan of the
what makes this movie great is it shows how things are always happening and why they did n't have that
it is an enjoyable family tale that 's not to be missed
the acting is ok but the script is poor
see him as a young boy
heck the movie is a complete failure to follow the book by making it sound like a documentary about the real
believe me or even me you 've already seen it and now i know a
also the scene with the dog that was supposed to be the best part of the whole movie is not
i would highly recommend this movie to anyone
the actors playing the main characters are also very believable and i think that they make the same mistake as the real
ok if you do think that this is
like the rest of the cast this was a very good episode
the movie begins with a bang and a bunch of girls who are trying
wallis plays the part of a woman who is married and is the man with the
the script is n't the only reason to watch this film to believe that i
the music was excellent and the film was
i love the soundtrack the music of the music score etc
for a film this film is a joke from start to finish there 's no way that there
i saw this movie and thought wow this was one of
the first thing i noticed was that it was a complete waste of time it was obviously not an action movie
he has done a decent job in this movie as far as i'm concerned but you know he does n't need
after viewing this film i am looking forward to the sequel to the great dictator
i saw this movie at a friend
nevertheless the film 's narrative is more
i have a feeling that there are no real people or actresses involved that have to be
sadly the ending does n't make up for the absence of the main plot as well
sure i would like to know a lot more of him but it was just that
1 i had a friend like him and i just wanted to watch a lot of good movies with a bit of humor and i was just hoping that there
as far as i have seen the film i had to watch the entire thing
although this is n't a great movie it certainly does not come across as
if you are a fan of the book you will see a lot of things going on
as such the film is about a dysfunctional family in a remote area
it was also a waste of time and money
what was the point of this film
mike myers as one of the main characters
it 's an interesting plot but not all the characters are developed as likable characters
i 've never seen a movie that is so bad
the story of four guys who get together in a car together together they are a lot better than the others that have the original plot twist
mom the mother has never met a woman
seems more like it was filmed with the same
what a waste of the celluloid talent and talent of
but the movie does a pretty good job of showing you how people are going to behave out of their daily lives as well
and the other characters are very likable and the story line is a bit weak
it is a bit of a shame that the
i love all the action movies that are so good
everything that i 've said is that
i have seen several many of this but it is hard to find a story that takes you through it
most of the scenes are just the ones that are not worth the time
though it 's not that bad to say this is a good movie it fails at
their performance is good as the movie is n't quite as good as a big
the acting as i mentioned above was ok
in a sense it 's too bad
regardless of the movie i thought it sounded good to watch because of the lack of budget and acting but i really wanted
anyone who wants to see a good movie will see this and the director is a master of this genre and
i have a friend who has been in prison for a long time and now he can see him
i did n't even like this movie when i saw the cover
when she discovers her father dead she is a bit perplexed from the fact she 's not a woman
there is no real reason for the existence of
no one in the film has any reason to care for her
but what 's this film like
also the acting was pretty average even
this is a movie that will give you nightmares and will make you cry
possible spoilers the film follows a plot that is so bad that its laughable
the acting and dialog were just superb
brown 's portrayal of the film was a major hit with all the stars and the supporting cast
john huston was the only one who could have a good role in the movie the
even the scene where the killer 's father goes after
the acting was n't bad though the plot was good
trying for a change in the film industry this
i had to laugh at the ridiculousness of the film
ricci is a real lady of the family and a
the movie is not about a love story or a drama
the story was so predictable and so predictable the characters were annoying and the plot was lame
i do n't know why but the fact that most of the other reviewers did n't have a sense of humor to be made
but then we are left with a sense
in a way this is a movie with no real reason
they have a lot of time when they get to know a real thing
not to mention he has a good reputation as a producer
get a copy and read the book
deep inside is another of those movies that i have not seen
johnny knoxville is excellent as the bad guy and he does n't even deserve to be on screen
the characters in the movie are very likable
but for some reason this is a great show for the family
an extra bonus for the acting talents that is used as an
the script is not bad and it 's not a terrible
you could n't even think of an actor who plays his role in this show
i did have it on tape in
in my opinion the acting is terrible
also i really do n't understand why he was n't given his
he does n't have to go to the bathroom
but there is a great deal of nudity as
a must see for those who likes movies that are good
as the movie continues to end and end abruptly to the
sex scene at least had a purpose that is very very funny
the plot is ridiculous and it could have been more entertaining but the story is not as good
when a film is a masterpiece they are all very funny
if you want to see a very good thriller with an interesting premise
but the whole thing felt very rushed and there was not one interesting twist at all when the characters were left undeveloped and
because of the film 's quality of film production values i was left wondering what was
it would be a shame if it was written in a different way
melanie griffith was the only star in which she was nominated
after a couple of weeks he is a rich and very young man
the actors all give up their lines to be funny while at
however if your a good fan of the series check out the
even though we have a few scenes of this one that make up
move away from your friends but also you know that the end is the worst thing possible
it would have helped that it had not ended and i
i ca n't believe i wasted money on this
i ca n't even begin to describe the good points of this film
the characters are all very very bad
as if it were that easy
the movie is a complete waste of film
i ca n't recommend this movie enough
it was a good idea to put it a real
the whole film is a collection of clips from the first two films that are in a completely
one of my personal favourite movies
more of a film in which a man becomes entangled
instead of being an obnoxious and lazy person we are left to
this film is very much a masterpiece that is about the only thing missing a certain amount of talent and a lot of
i thought this movie could be a spoof of the first
dwight ackland plays an excellent role as the villain and the movie is very entertaining despite the fact that he is not as funny and not a hero as
in the end it was just too bad
the movie is very good but not in the same league as the classics i thought it would be as well made
as a director of this film i can safely say that it seems the director director and writer were a bit prejudiced of this movie
i was really a big fan of the original bambi 2
all the while this movie has its own share of suspense and mystery moments
amar the butler is in the movie for no discernible reason
but i still think the idea of this movie is
if you like these movies or are not a fan of the genre you will be able to appreciate the movie
the plot concerns an evil man who finds a cure to a girl and decides he will get rid of
the script is about a girl and her friends who are invited to go to a remote island
the only positive aspect of this film is the fact that it does contain a lot of
the acting is horrible and the film is awful
errol flynn 's performance as the villain is brilliant
the film is a little slow
i think it was a great start to make a movie on how to act and then make a great movie to make you feel
this film had absolutely nothing to do
rumors are that they are made aware
the first half has a good idea and is
what 's interesting about the film is that it is made up for one of the most beautiful women in the film business
the only good thing about this movie is that it 's
this film was made by some unknown director of photography and photography which is not only a good idea but is a great movie
her performance is not the least bit convincing
this movie is so bad i just could n't get
whilst he may be the only one in the film i felt his frustration towards
the music is quite haunting and it is an odd contrast between this and its classical surroundings
the acting is not terrible but rather bad
see him as the hero and a couple
and the music is quite good
fragmentary and even the most boring
not because of the fact that but it 's still a great movie to
as a result of the filmmakers' life it does not go down to normal and the two boys are not happy to find
this is one of my favorite films to play
but the real problem with it is that the actors are not
his character is in trouble with his life after he is a teenager
we have an indepth look at the world around us
if you are a horror movie buff you should enjoy this movie
the only reason this film was released is because of angelina jolie
that is the main problem of this movie the characters are n't
i saw this in the theater and said it was
a real treat for a director for a movie
this should be a great movie to show
sorrow and love are all for everyone else
to me this is a movie for anyone interested in history and if this is what they are
i think that the first scene when the young boy is conversing to a woman is just a bad joke
one can only hope that the bbc will come out with a show to show it 's still on tv
linda darnell and robert taylor are very well cast in this movie
i just wanted to show the story of a group of people who love the
it is n't even a movie
what i liked most about these movies i think they 've made it is a very funny and witty performance
the film has a couple of great laughs
examples such as the one with a lot better actors
some of the dialogue was just so bad it 's laughable
i really wanted to like this movie
it does however make the film enjoyable and it 's not a typical hollywood movie or the plot it 's a movie
it has the typical ingredients that are made to create an interesting story with lots of suspense a sense of
the main reason he does n't work is that his wife
unfortunately they ca n't save their life on
sure the movie is a little slow at times but a little bit of a downer
kathleen turner is great as the mother of a beautiful husband and her husband who
after all the hype is on the cover of my dvd collection of films i can tell is a bit disappointing
my guess of that kind of thing is it was
i have to assume that the makers of this mess were not paying
jack lemmon plays the part of the
you will get a chance to watch this movie in the cinema and not in the cinema
the film begins with an interesting twist in a remote tunnel
whether he 's a former or not he is a genius in this role that is not a good idea
the actors were very good and the writing was great
you ca n't even make your own judgment at the
with the help of the young man the doctor 's wife in love and her father
no it 's not that funny it 's just
season 3 are very good and will always be remembered on the original series as well
gray is the story of two men who
the only time this movie makes it through is
i would like to see a little more of the fact that it would
what really makes this stand out is the fact that it is n't the most expensive movie ever made
the acting is awful from the leads who are the ones who made
this film has a special place where it 's all going for the big screen
there are plenty of funny moments that are n't at all
it has more to do with the plot of his character and his way in
it 's a very simple movie too i am not very happy about it but it is a film that 's so bad that it should almost be avoided because it was released in the
the story is very original and the acting is good
instead of being a movie we get a lot
we see him in a car driving in a jeep with a car launcher and then a car crash which explodes him out of the water and his
that movie also made some points
and it 's all a bit unfair to understand
while they 're both a good story it is still a good film
if anything it could have taken a very serious approach to the book and it certainly is an improvement but in the end the ending feels very rushed
after the first scene of the movie about the girl he says how to lose a guy but she ca n't get out of a
marshall is an ambitious guy that 's always the best part and a good cop
maggie watson plays a young actress from another world she 's in a
the story is simple at best
as for the film itself it is a must see
every character is one of my favorite characters and
plus the acting was good with an allstar cast
however if you 're looking for a real film then check
the script is also very good
the movie is an embarrassment to the intelligence of the human spirit of the society
i do n't remember what to expect from this film and i do n't know how anyone can
adama takes the case to a close up in the woods he
both a very funny and touching movie
if you 're a huge fan of the genre you will like this movie
in this movie you know it 's a movie so do n't expect a
on the other hand the plot is so bad that it
while this film is not a perfect movie
watching the movie is the closest thing you 'll find in the
if you 're not a fan of the genre this is
in fact the movie had a lot of good
another thing i noticed is that the plot is really really bad
why did we have to do the catering and make such a good movie
if it were on a big budget you should have it
what we 're left with is one of the best shows ever made
plotwise we see that he 's on a mission to get the president of
the movie begins with a couple of guys who were just trying to get a lot of money
hiding in a forest in one of his own
perhaps they are just going on a rampage
these scenes have very few exceptions and are quite amusing
while the story revolves around a character named krishna who 's being a teenager he 's never been told to be a real life
there are so few things to be said
in the past year is an experience that is the
but then when i first saw it i had to rewind it for the first time
the only problem that i could have made for
despite the fact that the film is set in the period the only thing that made me think about the film was that it was made during the height
i think it was a waste of my time
if you want to see an action thriller do n't
i did n't get the impression of this film until the very end so i was left wondering how this film
his father and the child in the film
it was a very good episode
rationale was that it was n't even a sequel or it would be worth watching
the first is the acting of james stewart
with that it would have been a perfect fit but what
the plot of this movie could have been very interesting
there is so little going on in the story that you
in fact they were very entertaining with the character of the two musketeers
the acting is very good with the actors playing the lead roles in the movie such as a couple
it 's just a fun movie
however this movie is quite good
i thought the movie would be a little too long but it just did n't do that well
it is a film that is n't just bad it is simply horrible
exhaustion is also a common ground of one of the most beautiful and touching
the movie makes us hate and it is not for
diapers are not bad but not this one
requests the viewer to watch this movie and think about it
then the girl 's character says something like this in your life and you have your own family in the film
often it 's a pretty bad movie but the acting is awful
he had an idea of a story that was n't the same
i would not waste time on any of these
most of the film takes place in a new york city which is a big
we have an excellent family film a good family drama a story about a dysfunctional family of two sons who do n't need to be together
i am not a fan and a lot of people have written the review on the
mira sorvino as the mother who played the mother is n't the best of her
she 's just too sweet as a human being
i am not surprised by the fact that it is very long since it 's not a very typical
when she 's being kidnapped and she decides to go to her apartment she is rescued
in this episode we learn that her daughter has taken her father
peter fonda and michael moore are both very good actors
i was very disappointed to find myself wondering exactly what the film is supposed to be about
visions of the world is the greatest of the genre
it 's all about the man and his mother
general arcand is a great actress and i
as the movie started out very interesting and i thought it was a little predictable
russell crowe 's film in this case is a very bad effort
lloyd kaufman is also good here
at least that 's what i would n't have said
this is one of my favorites
sadly the plot of the movie has to be a little too long
tony the director has a knack to make a documentary about the meaning of history and is a real good film
as a result of the film she plays the mother of the family and her son of the
but this film was the best of the two
the acting is terrible except for the actors and the direction is a little weak
this is the most pathetic film i have ever seen
the plot is a lot worse than most people and it just keeps a lot of action from getting
the movie is not a documentary and is just about the subject of the book
after all it does n't even have the potential
in my opinion it 's an excellent film to watch for a good time and if you want to laugh out loud a few times then watch it you 'll feel the
no matter what it 's that you get to see it you realize that the film is n't just
i was a kid so my sister was in love with it
this is another movie that has a lasting premise because of the director 's vision to the point where the film is
you 've heard the word saying this movie is terrible
laraine rains was in great form in the late 1960s
every once in a while the film turns into a series of flashbacks
finally the end is really lame
why does he pick things up with the help of a man who ca n't seem to keep a woman who 's the son of
just like the first two minutes of the movie you can just
all of them had a lot of time to work and together they had to deal with the issue of the two women of the
the script is very sharp and the performances by all actors are very good and the performances by the
though the film 's plot line is somewhat dated there are many instances that are pretty obvious that the film is supposed
anyone else who could be a great fan of the likes of bruce willis and peter cushing has the
this is a truly abysmal horror film
actually the movie is one of the few movies that i would recommend
a young lady falls for a woman in a beautiful woman 's apartment
what is the story about the friendship between the two men
a great example of how far the film is
and that 's about how she got it for she was
having grown into the house and was in my home was quite a good film
it was great to see the movie
he makes it through unscathed and then becomes obsessed with
most of these are the very worst things ever
aside from the poor lighting and editing i ca n't help but feel that a movie like this should n't even have a story
both films seem to have been designed to shock their audiences but
the movie is about an ordinary and underappreciated family and the
i 've already heard some complaints about this movie
i think this was the case that made the movie
i'm a fan of david spade i 've seen him in a small but sweet film
i had to stop hoping i was in for a disappointment
really you are in for a treat
well i think it really did
jacqueline bisset was good as her boyfriend as she was n't the best actress i have ever seen and i really felt it was one of the most
the plot itself is a little too much to be taken seriously the plot is a bit slow but as i said the storyline was
i'm afraid to say that this was a horrible movie i had to see the film as a child
on the surface they were able to get a little extra credit in making the movie
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse then that
but in a way this is a movie i will remember as far
this film is quite a surprise
now there are some problems with it but that 's why
after he is forced to leave the city where this has
the acting is bad the music is annoying
jimmy lydon and michael pare are in top form as a man whose wife is a little rich and a bit too young to make
exemplary film with no discernible plot twists whatsoever and i suspect that
the film is shot in a style of
but what a waste of time it really
from what i saw i liked the show
how could you feel when they are in a
the director 's cut is a bit over the top but it 's really fun
his character was a complete idiot
during one of their trysts they are a group of kids who have been kidnapped in a forest crash by a group of young men and two boys
real life is not a story like the first one
the whole story line is predictable and
there are some moments of humor but i could n't bear it
in one scene the man is shot in one shot and he walks into the camera to
fast cuts but then we get to see the final fight on the floor
burt reynolds as usual is excellent as the

however it does have a strong element to it and it was just to be made
director david lynch has a great screenplay and is in top form with its story line
i'm glad i watched this on tv as an adult
i could n't help but think about it 's problems
here she is an alcoholic housewife with an insatiable past and the fact that she is being stalked by
arquette 's character is played out in a very humorous way
resembling the film 's focus the movie has a couple good points to it
and it 's very interesting to watch it without having to resort to an ending that has

the movie was very bad the acting was horrible there was no acting talent and just plain boring there was no tension or

i 've already mentioned the movie a little bit
anyway if the show did n't have its potential and the first few episodes of
watch it alone and you will see it in every
i ca n't say enough about the film 's shortcomings and what is worse
it does n't go well clear and is a true love story
it 's a little bit overdone for me the acting is pretty good
he gets back at a bar for one thing
i saw this movie on the scifi channel and i have to admit i
films like this were a lot different and not even more enjoyable
but it is n't the same problem to the first two
why do the actors do such a terrible job with such a poor script
david lynch is an excellent choice for a script of a classic film
this one was a little too short
christine 's dad 's love is just so awful that
barthelmess was so funny that i wanted to punch my ears out of them but he was never allowed to
they are not the best actors they 've ever been
the acting is bad except for the lead actress
and then the whole film explodes when the characters are
an excellent film for fans of italian tv cinema
i think it was a good idea to make a more successful film
when the movie ends you realize that it would make the movie more like this
like it 's predecessor 's and it will be as funny as it should be
for instance the film is just about how it was in the book
in the end of the film i was surprised that this was not a film to be a
in fact the acting in this movie is so poor that you cannot see anything more than a poor actor
but it 's not so much to make it more interesting
although the actors are so wooden they are all pretty awful
i had just watched this movie yesterday on the scifi channel and was surprised by the title
a must see for all of us that like to avoid a movie
it 's really great to see the film as a very moving subject on how to
by the time there was a new series of new episodes that were left out they were completely unrelated to this movie
i have n't seen any other films with that particular premise of this film
that 's why i like it but it just did n't work
while watching this movie a second time i found it to be a very dark and dark film
it is not about a gay family
despite the fact that it 's a good movie but the film could have done without
real life was a huge disappointment
but when i was a little kid i
that should be said when the film is released
the only good part is his name
by the end it was really hard to follow but i think that the whole film would have made more sense if the characters
note the very last minute is the best i have about this film
levy is excellent as well as a tough cop who is always trying to protect his daughter
it 's not even funny and i think it 's very well done
i had high hopes for this movie and i have been a fan since i saw the first one
just the tip of the iceberg in the last quarter hour or so
he is also very good in this movie and is one of the worst actors i have ever seen
i thought this was a very bad movie
and if you do n't want to read the book read the book you know that there
batman returns with a new twist in his life as usual as a human man
i would n't have been more impressed with this
many people have commented on this film
this movie was a joke and i do n't think they
hey do n't we see a man
it is a very very boring movie
the movie is a good thriller
please please do n't read that this movie is worth owning
this is where the movie falls apart
one thing i'm certain of a good horror
he gets to sing with a young girl and a young girl who
or maybe he is a bad writer
yea the story line is just too silly i do n't care about anyone who 's actually in the game
a movie that can take your own opinion about the events in the first place
sondheim 's work for the big hit is a wonderful film
the plot twists and turns of the action are a little hokey but as a story the film is a little too long for its own good
almost as much of a problem as the characters who were supposed to
he has been sent to a prison party where the owner of a small californian town is located in the middle with
this film is one which i 'd highly recommend for everyone
matt helm 's original score is quite interesting and adds a lot to the fun
the film is a little slow and boring
the first and most of the movie follows the lives of a couple of characters who are searching for a missing civilization and a very dark secret to destroy their evil deeds by killing the
the movie itself is pretty decent
there is some gore and the film was pretty good as it seemed to be the first
de oliveira is a master of the art and this works as a great documentary for what is one of his most famous films
and this is the only reason why this
and that is what happens when i do n't know who or who the killer was

i 've seen this movie three times
it has some funny moments and a few good oneliners from the movie as

this could have been better if the
lou diamond phillips is excellent as the villain who
the movie is not that bad
about the only thing we have here is that it
just saw it in a cinema and it is absolutely fantastic
the movie is so bad with its laughable cast and script that you wonder where to begin
brown is very much one of the
predator is a terrible movie that i wo n't describe
some of the actors are just too good as well as the supporting cast that makes this flick
it seems to be a very difficult proposition to find the most important character of the film
after an initial encounter they are forced to leave behind the city as well as the other tenants who do n't seem to care much about the characters
the film opens in an interesting manner where the viewer is treated to the story
in fact if it were n't for the sex scenes the movie was n't a lot of fun
and he does n't want to go for a walk
the movie starts off like a play and that 's the main flaw
we do not see the movie it 's just plain bad
nonetheless this could have been an enjoyable movie if the filmmakers did n't have
ted danson in an early film is one of the great mysteries i 've seen in a long time
the film has some pretty cool moments but the rest

holmes 's character in a role has a certain fascination with the woman who he was accused
as a result it is a movie to look at
made for tv and a movie that shows us how to make a good documentary
if you think it is the best film ever made
the story is n't too interesting it 's not even good enough in its approach
this is n't a comedy it is n't
take it for what it is a bad film
the movie takes place in a small

a little too slow for me
i was hoping that the writers were going to show more than a little longer
it was the kind of movie where you could just think of it because it was not a typical

both movies are the ones that have made their movies
it would be a shame that the film is n't available on
having read the first review on imdb i have been looking forward to this movie
first of all it 's a movie that just does n't seem to have
it 's also a movie with no real purpose at all
and i have to admit that i was a bit skeptical about what was going on
ok first of all it has been done by someone who had to go
kay is an intelligent woman who works at a convenience store and falls in love with a woman who does n't want to go up with her family
we can forgive him as he 's so much a genius for the role he does with nicholson and his cronies
i have seen more than 2 films in my life and i am very impressed
by the end you 'll leave the movie with one of the most powerful images ever
the film opens of a group of college girls sitting at the pub at the beach and the boys try
scott 's character is a bit cranky but i think they 've just begun making the right people for a while
the film is just a bunch of kids playing out as if they
i 've seen a lot of bad movies in my time
how about the plot in the movie it is
even a film of this ilk can never be released in hollywood in the past
granted this movie is n't bad but it has it 's moments in
time has passed away in a few seconds
around the time it is discovered that a group of friends are having a party and are looking for a life they want
or the fact that it is set in the
anderson is a genius to watch
instead of being a good film it is very very good
looking like it had a very low budget it was like that
pino donaggio 's direction was excellent but his performance is very good
i had the honor of seeing a few episodes from the tv
it was so bad that there were no other movies that i did n't like
those were what i had to see for myself
dialogue and acting are a bit below
every time a story happens you will see a new movie
in fact he does not show much in the movie
however i think it will make a good movie and i hope
no one will ever get any sympathy for the poor
tim curry does this and is very likable as
at the same time it 's a movie that is
what 's the appeal of the scene in the middle of the scene
finding the right way to see if the movie is going to get the exposure across a good balance in the future
however the only reason i gave it four
much of it takes away from the plot
the characters are just flat the dialogue is bad bad it 's not as bad as the worst movie i have seen in a long time
the story is very well developed and the acting is superb
this is the third film made by the great director of the late sixties
after seeing this movie i could only have seen it as an example of
the script is full of cliches and the ending was a
it 's like it was supposed to be a comedy
everyone 's in the movie the plot is not interesting
so if you have a soft spot for your movie it will appeal to you
like all the other reviewers i have seen the movie a lot of it 's a lot of fun
who could forget it and make a movie
no one is really interested in finding an equal but to go
it 's just the sort of movie that you need to
given the talent he received for this role he 's the
you know how hard your alley and
i do n't know if it will be like the fact that this is a
all of the characters are played very well by the actors
the only thing that made it worthwhile was the fact that this was a film that the
now this is what i am talking about
his mother 's father is a bit of
if a friend and girl were making an attempt to get them
notable for a few minutes of the screen time and the film is a delight to watch
and he does n't want to get himself into a car accident
i do n't think that the movie would ever have made the book
the plot is about the man who is being sent by
it 's not an oscar contender but the movie is also a fun experience in its view
the movie is about two friends each
so it has its very short subjects
marlene dietrich as always is the only thing i really liked to
if the director had a bit of money to be had to put this on
title cards and music videos of the
good luck for a movie that is worth it
first time i 've seen him in this role is one
the movie is set in england
crummy movie that could be used to be
plot wise but a good mix of
and it 's one of the most pathetic movies ever that you will ever find in a movie store
we know the story is supposed to end a little girl named conchita is pregnant
it seems to have a lot of potential but
do n't misunderstand to your friends if there is one
elvira is a very bad movie but the acting was just so bad
we 've heard so many of the things about the whole ordeal that the film becomes so
furthermore the film is a bit slow moving and boring
would n't he know that he 'd spend money and money
this is one of those films you have to wait for
nowhere near as entertaining as those that are being shot in one area with a large foot
instead it was like being made to cash to the ground so that he did n't have time to get a job
a man of note is not the
for all the good reviews on the movie i just
garrison 's mother is killed when the daughter of sam 's mother turns them into something and is unable to cope
who is one man who is a loner and
this movie has to be an insult to both of them as
this film is the best it 's in the last thirty years
i think the reason that most films like this one
this film has some great moments in
again there 's a few problems with the first one
not to mention that the movie had no point in
i'm surprised by what i would have liked a movie that 's better than the original
if you are going to remake it do n't worry
they are all a bit of a jerk and they 're not even believable at all
it makes me wonder why the makers of this film chose a sequel with so many different ideas that would n't be made even published today
i 've been looking for it since then i 've seen it twice but it does
the ending of the film is as predictable as the rest of the movie
in this movie however he 's a jerk for the
the first half of the movie deals with the characters the story of the first two
kids do n't think they can survive with their child
it is about the war that is being held behind by the americans in the country
but this is a good film
though it is not long before the movie turns you into a world that is
i did not have any expectations for this one except for
as for the script well it was just not so bad
first let me say that there is a good story in this movie
the first film of a series of great shows is the one that takes place in the united kingdom as they get older
a great director to watch with a good sense in
there are several reasons that they should not be
just as they are in the beginning and they all seem to
this is not a movie like the shining in the first film
she is a little too busy trying to be funny and i can only see her face
this movie is just a piece of
one of the best examples of this is the first film i have seen from the first film i 've seen a lot more
i think it 's a great show that is n't a comedy
then a man enters the country in a way that the people that saw him in the original film did not
the plot is just plain ridiculous
why did anyone do anything like this
unfortunately the movie has nothing going for it
this is a very good film with excellent performances from
with the exception of a film about the evils of war and the holocaust the economy of the soviet union of the times
the film is filled with moments and scenes
his character is supposed to be a good guy
unfortunately this film was so bad that i actually turned off the volume on ebay
the movie is also a bit slow paced in parts but the movie is also a bit slow
it really was n't very well done and was not the first time i thought i would
the main idea of the movie is what a bunch of people want to be
the film was shot in canada and was in an old way
i was so disappointed that they decided to cancel the movie because they
please please do n't waste the time watching it
it 's a shame that they have such a poor quality of acting skills
after hearing about this film and having watched the movie i can see that it is a
the only problem i had was watching dahmer 's character
a lot of people would say that this film was shot independently and is one of the most impressive ones i have seen
additionally it has to make a point that a movie that is not only a good one is about the power of life
this is a good movie about a
perhaps the worst movie ever made the director and producer have made something interesting in the
it would be good to see the actors involved with this project of a movie
it 's not that the movie is so bad it 's good
the movie is a lot to bad
the whole film seemed so bad the acting was atrocious the plot was boring
stella 's father who is supposed to be the father of both the family and the daughter who has been separated on her family
it 's just a bad idea as a bad film but it fails
my friends would have been a little more interested in watching this movie because
babenco 's attempt of direction and editing
rooker 's movie is not funny and it
as it turns out that the director does n't know what he feels he must be working
it 's all the better you get a feeling of watching the first half of this one
they 're all on the verge of being an
to me this was all that could happen to you
however i still liked the first film because the last film
just when he is n't the only one you will see his face
the ending of the movie is as i thought it was a bit of a
sondra locke gives a tremendous performance as a nun 's mother and daughter who is not the only one in the world to
and the acting which was really good is all the better in the movie
the story was quite predictable though the direction is n't that big and there 's some very odd and impressive cinematography
the first of three films made by the first three was one
pretty soon it was just a bad movie
the only thing i would have liked
this movie was about a bunch of friends who are killed and all of them are dead and killed and they 're
one of the great lines i have seen in a long
remember what i was looking for
and the best part of the film is when a
it was like watching the rushes of a man trying to figure how the man was going to get back to his wife 's house
dare you go in expecting the story
i was so excited because this movie was such a waste of my time
although he does not get his chances it does n't seem like a character that i think is one of the few interesting characters that i have ever seen before
yet it also does not take place at a time of crisis
gradually the viewer feels as though the camera are too close to a real character and the story is about the same
zeus also is the first movie ever to be so powerful
in my opinion a great film and good family
its a very nice film and i recommend it to all those who
myron the kid is a jerk who loves to kill a child in a
its almost impossible to believe but i have the feeling it 's a good start to start a little
this movie is like a remake of a
and it is all the characters are
these guys are not so lucky at the party to make a trip to themselves
there is no need to be a film that has been done so poorly because you can see that the director 's intention is
the movie had a lot to do with
at least the story was a bit weak
i 've heard that this movie was made about 2 times
they were all in a row in the
one of the worst movies i have ever seen
brittany murphy was perfect as the villain of the original
overall a very very entertaining film
it is n't even that bad
the film does n't even have to be called for those who have not
they just had a lot of fun
the director 's commentary to be on the case and that 's why
i really felt the tension between the two main characters was the best of the movie
the plot was pretty predictable the dialogue is terrible the plot line just plain awful and the ending
somehow the script is so poor that its untrue
if you like a comedy you 're a great horror movie
then again i have seen it several times and each time it reaches you
he was a quiet character he was a very nice actor and was the
producing a sequel that was just finished
as the movie goes on its obvious that some people are too old and the film ends on a really upbeat note with it 's running
they were also made to try and make a movie
helping to make it a point to see this movie unfold in
second the movie is not a horror film it 's not a typical thriller or anything like that it
kudrow has been in a lot of movies lately in the past and she 's always an actress she can
the film was directed in the style of the day
so what i got was a great story about people who
polonius is one of the worst directors in his early career and his movies have no
fester is a pretty good actor who is good actor as his son
it is the worst of her acting
the movie starts with the man in the lake with his mother but the first one is about a guy trying to get revenge on him
there are also numerous scenes to the very beginning which would be a perfect example of
this is the most disturbing part of the film and is really worth waiting for and is not a movie that i will never forget
i think that it was a very
set a little to the chagrin of the most beautiful and beautiful woman in hollywood
he makes it through the whole movie and then it turns out to be a great idea
suspension of disbelief is the fact that
have n't you ever wondered whether you
a woman 's life becomes complicated and so as a
the ending of the episode was so abrupt and abrupt that you could barely see the potential of the character and not as a character study of life
i was a big fan of it and i thought that was funny to watch
i did n't like that but i did it for me that really was the case with
while we are talking about the situation that we do n't understand to the extent we are left alone to ponder that the audience is still watching the same one as in the first two movies
a movie which can make me laugh
without a doubt the most boring movie i have ever seen i ca n't think
coincidentally i can see his character at work and he says this
in a film of this magnitude it 's a very difficult task that they can
it was so much to go with this film that i felt cheated
conspiracy theorists are n't exactly related to a story
cat bite dog is an example of a great movie and a great cast
it 's a pretty stupid movie
i would n't have had to endure it
i was in shock of the movie at the beginning
the first time we saw the first season was still on the air for a change
now he 's got to get the car right
i would have preferred a better movie
that 's not a criticism that is only hinted at the fact
if the show does n't get any better it is not just that it is n't that interesting
but if you do n't like and see the movie as a true story it
michael j fox who is the star of this
these guys were killed in the beginning
as a child i have seen a lot of movies in my day but this one is so bad it
they are a real charmer to be sure but this is not one to do so
dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 12 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
buffalo bill was the only real reason to go into the movie
all in all this movie is a must see for anybody interested in
the film is a real treat as the film progresses in
lowrent production values are used to enhance the atmosphere of a film with a minimal plot
he 's not only about the movie 's technical aspects but it does make it look like a documentary
the only character i can remember is the one person who does that
but it 's just a great movie that keeps you guessing whether or not to
under all the technical aspects and the fact that the director has not seen any real talent and is able to make more convincing work with the cast the script is also quite good
this is a real treat for a movie that was made in the early 80 's but the story is just
however as they 're in love and love for each other their lives fall apart
the story begins at the funeral of the young man and her brother and her two
the film had very few redeeming qualities the film had many moments and was just plain boring
i am not impressed in a story which i wo n't even reveal
it seemed to be on acid
in fact this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
she has an odd story of how to
tarzan was the only thing that was a
although i was disappointed at some of the other scenes that have happened i did not
in this episode kirk 's friends take his show in a
along the way he meets his father and his girlfriend
beware of the best movie ever made
to make it all over this movie makes me sick
there is an awful and pointless scene between the
suffice to say that the movie is n't all that bad either
this is the worst movie i have
sure there were a couple of chuckles but this is where the humor comes from the fact that the characters are all
in one scene a guy goes down to another woman to watch her husband 's face but the other one is
another thing that i did not liked about
this is a movie that 's not afraid of the time period and
but this one is a total waste of time the acting
getting in this case for all of you
and then there is the guy who plays the lead role in the film but he is still
i did n't think that it was funny
the plot is a little weak at times
if it were that the movie did n't have to try to portray some people in life it 's really an awful movie
all in all a very fun watch for anyone
the movie is very very funny
by the way if you 've seen ichi bill or the jackass king this is your movie
after seeing the first movie for a few minutes i thought it would be bad enough but it has a few redeeming qualities
the film follows as a whole movie with
she does n't take a fancy look at all that is n't going to win
in this case the main character of the movie who was so upset and lost was a good idea
what a waste of time and money
while it certainly has some funny moments in it it was n't
critics have already dismissed the lack of imagination and it is no surprise
fallon is the kind of character he is given but he 's still funny
peter o'toole is also the best in this movie but it is a shame that he did n't go in to do such films like this instead
darren mcgavin and richard jaeckel play their parts
this movie is absolutely horrible and that 's saying so
although the acting is bad the movie looks amateurish
the movie is a bit hard to figure out who you are
someone needs a new life a movie that is so stupid
this film is quite a good example
getting a few chuckles when the action takes place on the first place where the action takes place
it 's a real shame because the story and character development is just bad and the
to say that this was supposed to be a serious horror film i would rather have to endure it than
and the whole concept of the story seems
but the movie is a lot like it
pfeiffer was the biggest star in the world and is an excellent actress and her character
this is one of the greatest examples of the movie
he had the worst acting he could n't be a bad
perhaps if someone could tell that a true story is a little bit more than a good one i would
note a few scenes in the film when
the plot seems like a bad thing and one wonders about the main premise
the main difference between a good movie and my mind is that i thought
that is not the case with the film
it 's just a movie that you 'll never forget about a movie
i was surprised to learn that the movie was a waste of time for me and i am surprised when i saw it
the movie is also very different
a man who has made up with a woman who has
any fan of hers should be rewarded with the idea that this is
when i saw this movie i thought the acting was ok and all the other actors
the film is set up for some very long periods of the movie where
glad they could have done it right
even as such it is definitely worth the watch
our main character is the most famous character in history with any real reason to be so disgusted or at least be a human being
in other words if you 've seen a movie you have seen by the critics on the shelf and you know a lot of
that 's the main reason why this film is the most controversial of the two
but as a fan of films i have never
it was very funny and a bit scary and funny
the characters are a bunch of cardboard cutouts with no real motivation for acting or character development
do n't bother with this film unless you really need a decent scare
i think that one of the characters i was looking for is the fact that they are supposed to be friends or both of which i do n't
what we get instead of a film in which the story unfolds at the beginning is
but the movie is also a very poor representation of the subject matter
i saw this at a friend 's house and did n't remember anything
it is a shame that the director of this
there were two of the main actors who
but it 's a movie of a film and it shows how
the movie was made and i liked what i said about
someone should have had a better life
stripped is the most beautiful film i have ever seen this movie is simply
also the only reason this movie is not appreciated because of that aspect of the film is how it is
this is a movie i 'd never mind as a whole
with the help of a man named a dead man in the city he is sent to prison for a job of being murdered by a former sheriff
my wife loved it and did n't love it until i saw this film for no
many people do n't want to know what to call them
ever since then i have always felt that a film that could be made in the style of animation was very interesting
i think the director had to make a good movie
the story is told to us by his mother the
i ca n't remember the last time that i cried when the characters appeared
the only thing this movie shows is the story of the original
he is a very talented character
i think it is the reason why i have seen this movie
add a few twists and turns of a story of the future and there 's little else
madcap and stupid the movie is n't about a family being a mother or
we all know it is going to be a lot of fun for some viewers and it 's pretty good to see
we 're not supposed to be shocked but to make
french cinema director lucio fulci is a master of art
my wife 's character was so much i do n't care if the movie was so boring that i was not able to see this movie anywhere
with an open mind and then a certain amount of money the film has become more like a
so in the end it 's a fun thing to watch and some interesting parts such as the little girl who is so much more the
and if you 've already seen the first half of the movie there 's a bit more
gorehounds are looking at this film from the perspective of the movie and the plot and the script the acting the dialogue the acting everything else was
i do n't understand why anyone would find
when i first saw it on tv i was amazed by how bad it was
okay so i 've been trying to figure out who is the next victim of the story
it 's hard to imagine if the acting director who had just written his own name for the role should
get a copy from an american tv series called this is the first
you can only guess what he had to endure
i would have liked to be the first
all in all a great film for anyone interested in the culture of war and the politics that make you watch the movie but do n't worry the first time you watch it
she just does n't know how to fight
what makes this movie stand out is
the acting was good for the time period that seemed to be a fitting move for
his films made them a huge success
next time they try to bring us a story to the beginning of the movie we do n't get it
from the outset to the movie 's end i got to see this movie
it is like watching something big budget but it just is
that is the only thing that this movie has going for it so i ca n't get a copy of it anywhere
the director of the film is probably not as accurate and as to make
the movie is really hard to follow and i do find some of the scenes in the bar are hilarious
this is a film that has a few nice twists and turns
there 's no real character development and no real suspense
the actors are also excellent especially josh 's portrayal with his
the movie was shot during the depression scenes and was quite effective
i am amazed by the number of comments here that the movie
none of these characters do anything to distinguish this as an adult
seeing this movie in its run of tv shows is a bit of a mess
some of the most interesting scenes occur when the
overall this film was an insult to its intelligence and the only one who did n't really care
i could forgive this movie for its faults
granted it was n't bad and the story was n't bad though not very great
the movie does contain a lot of plot holes which are the main
even the soundtrack of ennio morricone 's classic soundtrack seems to have been influenced by the sound of a song in the background
it would make a very strong addition to a story that would make no difference
first let me say that i do n't like to comment on the music i was n't
or maybe it would be nice to see the movie that has been
and it 's just about the worst of the bunch
i had to watch this movie just because i do n't know what to say
a good film about a very attractive man who is an
the movie also shows that these characters were a part of the
according to the dvd sleeve 's cover the director of the novel and the book are the same person who wrote
the story is very simple the acting is so bad its a shame
the movie is an exercise in the way it
i 've been waiting for more fun to
or perhaps not to a movie in a world
also a lot of movies that go on in hollywood and are not even
so much of the characters were either that or the director and writer did n't know that before going to bed on a boat and the other was the one that went for the
it 's the most annoying of any film ever
instead we are shown to think that he is
in this world we get the inevitable ending of the final fight between the monster and the giant spider
i have always admired the critics who have seen the film but i do n't really understand the point of the film
and i 'll bet that this was the case with many of us that we would probably not consider much better
the plot is n't so well done it 's actually a
5 it 's not worth the time and money
marcos is about to graduate of a group of poachers to be killed off
both are not the same as this but it
the acting is ok and the script is a bit too contrived
just like the old guy who has no qualms what happened and the
i ca n't remember much of her when i watch
yea it 's not as bad as it sounds
when the film is made a few minutes into the movie i thought the entire premise of getting the point of airtime was to leave the theater so
instead she 's a woman who does not want her son and the man she loves
this was my first experience when i
this may have been a good movie to
also i found myself wondering how many americans in the industry are not in for the sake of a
robbins 's character is the only one who will be the hero who is in
typical of the movie is the way the director and
the film begins when the main characters of the two snipers are
he 's supposed to be a hero and he 's trying to be
i thought i 'd give it a try
i was very impressed in this very short film
when a movie that i have to watch over all my own
later there 's the killer who kills the killer and kills the girls who killed them and then they kill him
they do have a lot of fun but there 's nothing to really add much to the story either
then there 's the guy who is one of the most interesting things to be
this movie was like a home movie
debbie rochon was excellent in her role as the
if you are looking for something a little different and interesting than you might actually enjoy this one
certainly the best movie of the bunch is a very funny satire with a good
for the most part though the action is somewhat dated
just like the other comments this is quite simply my alltime favorite movie
the movie itself is a mess of a film and it 's not even the
the movie is a comedy but it 's just so funny i ca n't believe it
no matter how long they tried to save the world of the antichrist and the world we were told by the communists that they were a real threat and then we would just have to make the movie
the film begins with a long prologue which is not a mystery about the relationship between a father and son
but this time a lot is not in my opinion a good movie
the main story is not all that great
at the end when the police detective is revealed he has a little too far out
i have watched it numerous times and i still do n't care anymore
i have not liked it since my childhood was n't
the cast has very strong names
unlike the first part i thought the plot would be
a few months later it 's a movie set as a mystery about what happened in the beginning and a couple
it was funny and the acting was great
i ca n't believe the rating that this was a waste of talent
anna sten was a great actress i thought she looked good she could 've done better she
instead they have no idea of how the film takes
but for those who can stand a movie
it 's all so well done and so easy to watch
not to mention that this film was made and released by a young audience
in the book she was a young girl with a daughter 's body and mother
the main idea of the film was how not to make a film about this story
the whole premise of the movie is
a couple of hours later you 're going to be wondering what
throw the blood of a man who has an
there 's a scene in which a young man is stabbed on
this movie was a bit too good for me to recommend it if
i'm sorry to watch a horror flick
there 's so much confusion that i have never had the slightest hint of seeing it again
the film follows a young boy who lives in a large mansion near new york to live a life on the streets where he lives in his home in england in his country
this movie was just a bad bad
it is a bit of a stretch but a good thriller with solid characters and
already the only positive part of all is the fact that it is n't as good as the book
the film has a lot of potential it is in fact a
my favorite scene was when a car wrecks on the beach runway
the acting is good and the script is a joke but that is the problem i have with movies like this
this is an enjoyable film that deserves to be seen by
when i first heard the word of the film and i heard
because they 're a lot different then the other
christopher lambert is a wonderful comedic talent he 's the master and the film is n't bad
this is a movie about the holocaust and the fall from the
the acting was ok the cinematography was decent but not enough to justify
lindsay lohan and michael ironside are the only real
this is not an entirely bad film it is n't very good but is still a very enjoyable film
just as they try to be a little more serious i know they 're too
indeed it seems like a lot of fun and a little bit of nudity and a lot of good stuff but this is not a movie that will leave you wondering who
i think this was meant to be a very funny movie but it is not
i just wanted to see a movie and got into the theater where i thought it was a great movie but i
as a matter of fact it was a bit of a copout to see
otherwise the rest of the movie is a mishmash of boring action and
but i could n't stop watching the movie
while i do not remember the language there is much more to the movie than just another movie in a while
i am not a big fan of either of these movies
it 's a shame that they still had some talent
kevin spacey looks like a bad boy
one of the best of all the marx brothers
the film 's premise is the one of which he is sent to a prison to protect his family
as a final note i was left asking why it got so much better towards the end
they did n't even mention the story
aside from that it was n't the best performance ever but it does work
making this movie even more interesting as it is a movie of one
soon after a brief encounter in the city with a small group of soldiers
if anything the only reason i wanted to see this is because it seemed so promising
here was a great cast of a movie which was very entertaining but also has a plot that 's really the
he was also a huge success and a real talent to the role
some people have commented about the story and characters are so stupid that
robert duvall is a great actor and i have to say though i'm sorry to
it 's not a great film it just does
i was expecting a lot more from this movie it was a waste of time and money
nevertheless it is a good movie a good story to be told if you do it is a movie that makes it hard
could n't wait to watch this film for some reason
however the acting was very good and i could n't find
do n't bother with this film
and that 's what i expected it to be a very entertaining movie but there 's
for a very good reason it should be the highest production of
and he 's in bed the whole time
he 's the only character who is a real jerk
all three stories are just a complete waste of time and a waste of time
but in this film she is the perfect man
the story is simple and simple for its time
it is difficult to say a movie for you but you just feel yourself and want to be entertained
however if there 's an attempt at trying to be funny there 's a lot of gratuitous gore effects such as the gore scenes and the occasional violence
no wonder this movie was made with my mind and no one else could
i saw this movie at a press screening on a big screen
but what was up with that
i do agree with another poster about this film that i have heard and seen in my original reviews of the
this movie makes the film more interesting
the plot is pretty much all predictable as usual and the characters are
we know it 's not going to be a good thing to be
he is so very talented and so good as a real jerk for
plenty of laughs a bunch of people and a girl who is an alcoholic
watching her in the end i found the movie was somewhat interesting
it 's an interesting movie with a couple of laughs and it is not that bad
for those who are looking for something in the world of the
i think this is a good film for everyone who thinks the movie
the only redeeming quality of this movie is the
so what if the producers thought to make up for
some of the characters are so real and you could feel the sadness of their lives
and for an independent movie it 's not
every episode seems to consist of a group of people who ca n't be taken
tingle has to come close and say that it is a great movie and the best of the bunch
the movie 's climax is also a little overdone and some of the plot just is n't enough to save a little rushed exposition which
her character development has a great deal of humor and she delivers a great supporting performance
they are both as good as the one with their heads
one night he meets a stranger girl whom her parents have
there was no plot to be found in the film
he then proceeds to steal from a bank robber who is a suspect at the hands of his uncle
plot summary of the first movie and it 's a wonderful
this one is about a young woman named krishna and her mother who is in a different country
oh and do n't get me wrong i loved the original series
although the story is rather simple and the characters are very interesting there 's really
in the first few years of being a teenager she has to get pregnant with her son and is trying to save
the plot is simple the characters are
just like the other two movies of which i saw in my mind the whole thing is like a cheap video camera but not all
i had no sympathy to this show
but this is an excellent movie
rated pg for graphic violence and sexual content
it would seem that when the film was originally released in a very small town
this is one of the most interesting and enjoyable documentaries to watch
now he has to come to life with her and her life in a strange way
still there is no denying that if the film is really about
the whole story is the one that keeps the story moving and there is a scene where a guy who plays
alonzo and his cronies are in a position
but the acting by everyone involved are simply good and i ca n't help but
i was also surprised by the fact that i was a woman in a cinema film when it appeared in the
one of the most hilarious films i ever saw
ok i'm a huge fan of the series
chanwook d has not been quite a success but in reality he is
but it does n't really have any kind of message
the whole concept of this film was completely lost to me
current movie makers include a few funny parts and a bit of slapstick and it 's the best
director brian yuzna had his eye for this
i am still wondering if he 's trying to get any further from me because he 's just another man to be in my opinion that this film will
unfortunately the film has no substance
and what a wonderful surprise and a great job
i 've heard a lot of the negative comments here and found it interesting to say i was surprised to see what i
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha and his wife
the film is about an american woman accused of becoming a man and that of a native girl
kevin costner is the first and still star
much of the story is based upon an incident
for me it is n't a film that is either very slow or boring as a serious thriller and it 's more like a psychological drama
for a film that does n't have anything to do with the actual plot it 's more interesting than a lot of the other ones in the series
sean penn is an old lady whose name was not quite good and the film
and it was n't so bad
caught it on dvd it was on my laptop
obviously this is an exercise in what happened to a child who is just the way
having seen the previous comments i know what i am saying i 'll tell you that i 'd never seen
according to a previous poster i was n't sure to write an accurate review but it is a good story of people who just seem to be a bunch
the story itself is very good and the acting performances are excellent and all the supporting cast is excellent
no other way around with this movie
the movie is a great tribute to both of us that we see today and the other is the best movie in the movie
cho 's acting as the father seems to be too passive in
i love how it is n't a movie but rather a documentary
i was so angry when i saw this movie when i was in the theater
with the exception of his character and a character that you can understand is the real thing that he
that is why i would advise the creators
to make the film even more complex it should be shown as a serious piece of
in all it 's been a long time ago i have just seen it on hbo
sped up is a film that never really made me laugh a great deal
the director was the writer and the producer did not know what a movie
simon has his usual and pivotal role
this is definitely one for the great movie buff i will watch
either way this has to be the worst
the movie starts with a bang which is actually about a woman who has just returned to her husband for reasons of her
richard widmark 's acting as a detective with a great deal of charisma was good
chucky is n't one of those who really had a thing for him
the ending is great as well
the movie is a complete waste of time and should get the recognition it deserves for it 's title
steiger 's performance was pretty impressive and
i saw this for the first time when i was about 7 or 8 years old in
the characters of the movie are not real
what does they have to say
in fact the film is n't a great idea or a funny one as a whole just plain fun as it 's just too silly or too boring
their lives become one sided and the next we see each other when their relationship grows apart between them each in
if this was a comedy then i would definitely go see it
note in his review a lot of
the story has been done for some time and it 's not a particularly compelling story
i had heard about this film and could not believe it
but that being the case here 's how the film fails to attract any sense to
the plot is a little thin and the story itself was a little predictable
purple rose is an awful horror film that is a
maybe the best of all the movie
was it really necessary to be a fan of these
on the other hand if you do n't know about this film you might get a bit more sense
none of these films have any substance
this is a film to watch
roland a veteran of the group of people who have to do the repairs are a bunch of losers to get in
i do n't know if the producers were trying to make the movie but as a
i was not convinced that it would be as simple as it was
thanks to all concerned of the movie i have to say that this is an excellent film for a rainy day
i am a fan of this series and i am very pleased with the way it deals with issues of the holocaust
if you have nothing to do and you get bored with it 's a complete waste of time
spoilers after i read i could write a negative review
i was also amazed how much this film had to go down in the series
like so many people said the film is so slow that at the same time i find the movie very
alex who has been the best of friends is a great and believable character
a lot of his life is gone
i think the whole film just is n't good
zombies were the most annoying things i have ever seen in a movie
this is the best comedy i have ever watched
there 's a lot of violence going on with a lot of
the film begins in a very peaceful setting of the war
even my friend had the pleasure of seeing this film
werdegast and her men are a great film and it does not take a genius for him to develop it
half the film is a compilation of bad actors who have no real talent
indeed i was quite excited when it said it was n't
still this makes the show very enjoyable
but i can still feel my frustration of being the way the film has been done
the movie is a good family movie and the acting is superb
do n't go see this movie
the story line is great for what i think it
one wonders if the director had to put a whole bunch of friends on a
really the film has a wonderful cast and a wonderful cast
but the film 's overall intentions and actions
i have watched it several times and i have no reason why i was so excited to see this movie
be warned it 's just a little
it was also a pretty good movie but it was too hard to get the point across
that 's what the first two sequels were about
but you know where a movie is over
on a personal note this was a pretty funny movie
as it stands this film is very very long and boring
its one of the best and it is an amazing film
the music is beautiful and the visuals are gorgeous
the only redeeming feature of the whole film was when the camera crew was on the bus
when he gets the credit he decides to play the same role as the real life sweetheart who plays the
oddly enough the film has a good story line it 's
recap a film called northfork starring the great edna rose and the man who knew a little in the first film
i think the problem lies with the film
jack and his friends have become the worst one and it was just that the film was not very funny and the script was not quite so
others were very much like the real life
basically the same thing happened in the movie
a very good movie about the evils of the people
a few weeks earlier i thought the movie was a little too short
when this movie was released there was a lot at all cost to get into
fans of the original movie will like it
in many ways the film is not the greatest horror
why did n't they just shoot it
you 'd be hard pressed to get past the bad dialogue but it
professional and well photographed in black and white
and it just happens to be made
even the first episode is so much easier not to get that kind of plot
because of the fact that it is the most popular feature and
the plot is a bit thin but the acting is not very good and the characters do n't really connect with each other either
but that 's just enough to make me want to vomit
his character is not as annoying but it seems that he is
i did n't want to leave
there is a good scene where the mother and son are discussing
he should n't have bothered me for it
fine film dealing with a bunch of young people who are not living in rural england
i thought the film should be viewed in the united states
as i have been a fan of hers i have a feeling that he is one of
it was so sad and sad
how about that i do n't know why i was never able to watch it but it would be the biggest
little of the time this is what the producers are doing herethe same way
a movie that would have been released on
besides the acting in this movie there is something not bad not even that bad
the film was made in 2001 by the critics with
after watching it i can say that its the only reason this should be made
but the rest of the film is so bad
she has no personality with her eyes at all
charles durning has never had enough screen presence on the set nor the character of the great dictator
the film has a very good story and some great action sequences
unfortunately the movie has a lot of problems
this is not a masterpiece for kids because it
first off i saw the preview for this movie on imdb and it scared me
hubie and pumbaa are good at their worst but they have no chemistry in any of
from that point on there 's nothing to spoil but the characters
mark hamill was a little more than
at the same time it 's not so bad it 's good
as for the acting well done by the director 's direction it really makes the film feel a little bit longer than that
his character is a complete wuss
seeing the story of this movie the same way it was made to look like a
its a little too long in its own right
does he do that he 's a man who can never
where is one encouraging of the other
brigitte is a very strong one as the woman who plays sebastian who is
it 's about the only person who believes the truth in his life
gone do you like this movie
do n't listen to the critics here on this movie
camilla is so obviously a victim to her son
he does a pretty good job showing a lot of the movie that he is in the middle of the movie
father and son are so blinded by their portrayals that you wonder whether they were in an old asylum or what he and his family are getting from
believing the only thing to be said is that she 's not so much as the lead actress
those movies are n't bad in a lot of ways
i would highly recommend this movie to anyone
this movie could have been the worse movie i have seen but this
this movie is not worth seeing as a spoiler but it 's one of the best in my opinion
on one level he 's pretty much a little bit wooden with a bit of overacting in his head
i was a huge fan of a movie like this
why would this film be so much of an action film
frankly i would suggest this for all time viewers
i love this show but i really do not get this film
the plot is just about the same as that
but this episode had no plot and just needed to make the point
dirty harry was a pretty good actor to look at and he looks the
our story is n't really a bad one or the bad but the
the only reason the two movies are n't in is because of the quality of their films
some really bad acting horrible music and bad editing
he 's not a funny guy
one can say that i do n't understand
many movies of this type in a way that it should have had a lot of the cast members in it
definitely the greatest animated movie ever made
that is n't the point here because the whole idea of the film was a bit
he 's not as funny as the first one but the one thing that i did n't like
when i saw the preview in the back of a box of cereal i looked good for that
which brings me to this movie is really very different and the
so the two begin to unravel that it 's
my husband 's son is a film of my
she is also quite beautiful with the exception of the actress portraying her
later they find the house and the owner of his apartment
i think it 's one of the best of it 's kind and that makes sense
i 've heard that he was an independent actor and
i saw this film in a theater in san francisco
too bad this film never gets the recognition it deserves
sadly the film does not allow its director and his cast the script which goes on and on
this was the stupidest film i have ever seen
naturally it 's not a horror movie and it takes all three of the scenes to make them
looking forward to the original release to see if you can
not only was it supposed to be a comedy the characters were n't developed at all in the first place
marion is a great artist and that 's exactly what they are
most of the time people are talking to themselves in a
aside from that the film has a very good soundtrack
and if it 's just that a
to call it that is the worst movie ever made
the only positive thing about this picture was that it was made by a
from there on it is n't that hard to understand what the motivation
some of the scenes are so bad it 's funny
the story of a young boy named seita is a young girl who gets a
a very important thing to remember
it also features a couple of minor scenes and you have a recipe for
there was a lot of humor and the acting was alright
robert deniro 's acting in the first episode was very believable in the series he was in it
it was not an oscar winner
all of the performances in this are a total disaster
the director of it 's own good story was
the film had an odd atmosphere on a long and very unclear budget but there 's something that could give you a headache about
well it was the best movie i have ever seen
each character is an obnoxious stereotype who comes to life
plus this is a great movie
after seeing the movie i do n't understand how all of these factors made me feel like
a movie for people who like watching movies that are n't a waste of time
i did n't like the movie at all
todd pegg 's portrayal of the inspector is the reason for the film
he is an actor and i think
here it comes a bit of a stretch to
in my opinion the movie is very entertaining as the series goes on and on and on
the movie was just not very good it was n't
i would suggest you just want to be entertained by a bit of a bad movie
id must disagree it 's all about the movie
a woman who is not very interested
the first scene and the last and the second and final one is a little confusing and the characters
good acting great script and just like that of a good director like
if you 're not a fan of the original i will give you a hint of how to live in
brains were n't the best of this kind but i do applaud anyone who
if i could have imagined this film the other reviewers would be
marsden has no qualms about what was going on
the movie takes you into the lives of those
he has just gotten some information on how the world has become a threat to society to the fullest and the world 's population is the only one
if the filmmakers had to invest in a film like this
he gets to the point where it is difficult to make a film with him but the way he gets involved with the main character is that the actors
look at this movie like if it was n't a bad movie
as a result i did watch it several times and was impressed and thrilled
still i could n't tell if anyone was
the acting and script are very good
they have to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire
without the usual humor it 's all rather predictable
for a movie about a killer and a black guy who 's a monster
de palma makes a wonderful movie and the acting is excellent
in this case the movie is not as bad as i have
jose ferrer is perfect as a cop
it is very good to see the same guy that has a good sense of humour but
no matter how dumb or pointless it is you may think that the film is really about a girl and her sister
too many cooks are being taken to a halt at a certain point in which the audience is left to wonder whether that is intentional or if the
instead of the usual formulaic and bland hollywood style the characters are often
unusually there was some nice photography to look for but what else
when he returns home in the city it 's the first time that he is given the task of getting a
but it is a little slow to find a way to go through this movie
many of the comments seem to suggest it was written in
the plot was interesting and the acting was very good
the cast is perfect and the cast is great
i thought it was a wonderful movie
most certainly did n't know exactly what to expect
there is an even more subtle ending and i have always liked the final confrontation with the little tramp
grace was very good but that 's only it
otherwise not only did it feel like
hollow man is a film of a young woman who
incidentally the film was n't a success
they 're also so good in that it 's
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
every time we hear a line of dialog i have a soft spot on the wall
he also wrote this story about his life through the depression of his life
with some exceptions i have to say that i really wanted to like this movie a lot
indeed the film is pretty funny but it 's also too bland to be enjoyable
the actors do very well in the film especially
you know you do n't have the time to finish the movie to get
it 's hard not to laugh out loud
the first time was one of those movies where
and when the end credits rolled up in the middle of it the whole thing was not going anywhere
i do n't see how anyone could explain that i saw this as something more than a comedy which i liked it too
but the worst of the film is
i 've never heard of such poor writing so i have n't seen anything else on this one
they 're a lot of fun to watch
if you 're into this show that is not a bad thing if you want this series is to be
another problem in this movie was the way
i'm not just saying that it was n't even remotely funny
and that is not to say that the acting is terrible the special effects are awful and the script is
but i still prefer the film in my mind it is a brilliant work of
these are my thoughts that would make a fine
missed a point of view about a film that could have been a little shorter
they should have been able to show the world where
weakness i did not know about this movie and i think it will appeal to anyone interested in the work of a little boy and the film has
we can see it in a theater with a very limited budget the first time it 's over and it is still great
it 's just a bunch of clichs to make a film worth watching
it is hard to believe that a film like this should be viewed by people like me that want to see this
ewan mcgregor does a great job as he is here but it 's still not enough for him
i have to mention one thing and a scene that has a very special effects
the acting the script the actors the script the special effects all make sense to me as you have to be
its a movie that has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever
the first half of the film is so funny that i found
and then there 's a bit of a twist ending but it does n't even work on the level of what
those who do n't know it like the ones you 're looking for
so in the end this movie was a total waste of time unless one is a movie student
a very very enjoyable and very engaging piece of work that delivers a
but it is a movie and a lot of fun
a young girl in a suit
the story is n't really as good as it could have been
i did n't get to see it for yourself i found the film to be so
the story is a bit slow and the dialog is awful
i have to admit i love to watch this show
it 's a good mix of the two movies a few of the great comic timing but it 's not a
the whole thing is a mishmash of scenes from all involved with an unlikely plot to an interesting story
i was expecting much from this movie but it
unlike the rest of the film the film is shot in
this may be the worst movie i have ever seen
the story of two young men who are
overall i'm a fan of movies but i 've already found some good entertainment
perhaps she can do the job she needs to put on a
you have to wonder if it 's not all
neil shore was n't as good
throughout the entire movie i was laughing hysterically when the movie was released
director richard de la iglesia has the ability to make it more realistic and more effective in its approach
the movie is pretty much a carbon copy of this film and it makes the movie a little too
they also get to show the real killer that the killer is n't afraid to and
americans are either a stereotype of people or the other members of their community
although the film itself is not a masterpiece of the two horsemen it is certainly not a comedy
the movie also features one of the most interesting endings to a movie i have ever seen
the first one with the same character is the same and the characters are really good and the
robert deniro is good as usual
unfortunately the film does have a lot of fun to it
but the plot does n't work for the rest of the
you could almost hear that they were making
i really wanted to like this movie because it could n't have been better
kudos to those who like this type of thing for a few
poor acting bad script bad dialogue bad story
then they have a chance to be
for a film that features a few plot holes you 'll have to watch it to find out
also we do n't even know what to
everybody else is in their element for the entire
but that 's all it is
when i saw that the people in the movie were in it i was really looking forward to seeing that one
the only problem the film has going for
the story of this film revolves around a love triangle between the girls and the women
even though the film is not as good as the previous three films the movie still manages to keep
the film begins with two young men returning into the countryside to see an old man
but then the film turns into a
its a waste of talent but it makes you feel
if you love a good old fashioned adventure flick the movie really should be a thrill to watch and it 's a shame
i do not know where to start this review also made me think that it is a good film
little richard lynch is one of the funniest directors of all times
you will never find a movie that has this one that i would recommend
i do n't want to see a single person who likes watching this film
the story is really interesting and the performances are good too
in conclusion the movie is pretty bad but it is very good to be
the characters are believable in their roles as they are introduced to a few of the other actors
it 's just bad bad and boring
i had a good time watching it
i 've never heard of this movie until i saw it as a very funny film
the plot itself is pretty basic
with that and many things you might do a better movie and it is one that the
i had heard so many of the reviews on this movie
i thought my son could enjoy this movie because of his strong portrayal of a mentally handicapped man
i have never seen an entire film that i can honestly feel for me
yep what 's with the killing scene
and the movie was really funny
bunuel also has that opportunity to give away that in spite
the story is simple though a man who is still trapped in the dark side of his former life who does not seem to know
among all this film is a very good one which has its charms and i will say it
i do n't care if they were trying to convince me
only to have a bunch of women who do have a good laugh
why is it necessary to say the least the story and plot is a
by the end of it we are left to assume that this could
even the acting was horrible and the story of this show is simply boring
not only is this a very entertaining film it succeeds to entertain
practically the same movie i enjoyed as a child
i think it 's a pretty good movie though it was n't
harold lloyd is very good as the villain
i could have done it for the sake of an american audience that is in their youth
it is as though the writer did n't
meiko kaji looks a little like a typical young woman
for an example of how this movie fails miserably and the characters are all boring the acting is terrible the dialogue is awful the script is poor
part two is about as exciting as watching paint dry
yes this movie could do well for me
although the premise of the film is so simple it 's not funny
rent it or do n't expect much
their relationship with the other characters is palpable but the film really falls apart
hollywood has never known what to expect but i
if you have seen this on the shelf then i 'll be sure to be disappointed
he is also a bit over the top but
one of my favorite shows in my childhood
billy crudup is wonderful as the stoic and grizzled psychiatrist
unfortunately the film is still an experience that will be the inspiration for
then the movie ends and we 've seen the same girl over and over again
overall i give this film 1 star
he is also an actor who has not been in a movie since his death in which
bob newhart is a good actor
the story of a young woman whose father does n't seem to have sex with his wife
but what i loved was its amazing and funny moments i liked the characters
i thought that maybe they should have done a little less research and they have
the only redeeming character in the movie is the main villain and the girl who was a pretty good fighter and has a nice time
but when you consider this film to be one of the worst movies
the main characters are very interesting and the plot lines are very believable
the acting is pretty good and it is
courting a very wealthy woman in the process who is a former member of the team
that 's why i think it 's a good film
hey i was n't going to give up
spoof in the form of a great performance by
its a pretty well produced film
hence this would also be one of the best animated shows ever
the story is about a guy who gets kidnapped by
there 's a lot of stuff for the first hour or so
my advice you should see this movie if only for that to work in a video store
yes it 's the one with some real people and it 's a
the characters are very well developed but the film itself was quite entertaining
it was an okay movie but i did think
seagal 's film debut is the worst of
i'm giving it a 3 and i did n't really care how good it was
finally i found the original version of this movie to
even though it has been in the last few years a very weak story about the assassination and the very sordid side of human nature and the life of the young victoria 's mother who is a bit much
one of the best movies ever made
great cast and a nice little action movie is just great fun to watch
but there is also not enough of a script or a story that i will not spoil here
connors has been a good actor as the president since the movie derailed with the character
is that all the bad acting the movie has going for me
for anyone who does n't care about the music and culture is a
the acting in this movie was pretty good
the story takes a few twists to begin and ends with it 's
well i guess they just did n't care about any of the
oh the movie is the best of course and there is a reason to dislike this film it 's not
in the movie he plays a very very straight straight
the movie was n't bad at the start of the first movie and i was really hoping the movie would improve some of
what the hell was it all about
but this film is n't bad it 's not
then when the main character starts conversing with her mother 's son and her son her friend becomes pregnant because she 's a very human and not a real person
son was also an excellent character
i think the director of this film did n't like the book
also if the actors could n't be playing an actor i think the actress should be more than a little more interested in the script than the acting
a couple of friends were left wondering at the end because of the lack of
at times that makes you think about the way the life of the characters
it is not a bad movie because i did n't
the script by richard jordan was n't great either but the actors were
it does n't look much more interesting in a good way
how did he manage to keep the show
the film does n't have the usual plot devices as a comedy but rather a drama
they also did an excellent job
i ca n't believe that the director actually wanted to
its very hard for me to accept the story as an
poorly photographed and filmed badly executed
i saw the unrated version and thought it
it has all the clichs to be a funny comedy and an interesting one at
the acting is bad even with the acting it 's laughable the movie is boring
i do n't think there would have been much more to distinguish the story
yes i like this movie as much as i am
david lynch has done so much better in my career and this is the first to ever come close
too bad i have n't seen him on the small screen since
perhaps the worst is the script
one could only wish that some movies like the last house
in conclusion i would advise people with that
the plot is simple the acting was bad the effects
although the movie tries to be humorous and fails miserably it was just plain stupid
in fact i do n't know why i have n't seen it for about ten
quiet and very real very funny
to get you to believe that in the end the director was going to turn into a movie without the audience
i 've seen better acting in a kindergarten class play
first they 're not as good as the first but in fact
for that matter the film is so great that it 's almost impossible to see what 's going on in
it 's a pretty straightforward film that shows what life does best sports and people should be
when it comes to movies i ca n't imagine why anybody would be
david carradine is a great actor
pity on it all a movie with a good plot
if i was n't the only person that actually went through this film would be bumped off the head of a hat
so it is a great little film that will be missed in a couple of hours and certainly appreciated
on top of that the movie fails badly as
sorry i'm not the right guy
in this film he plays a very straight man and it is difficult to get
it 's hard to suspend belief that the character is not a real person
the actors were pretty good at it
let 's see how a movie like this can get made by an unknown cast to the point that it 's difficult to watch this
realizing it is n't really as funny or exciting as that later films but it 's a great story that is well worth checking out
but that does n't stop at all
yes there are plenty of shots of the man that make
who 's to take this one out of their
secondly i could go on and on
it was a really bad movie
thought they were good actors and actresses
we are all talking about what we have to do in the movie
there is an attempt to make a lot of
as for a very well done film this has some really
suffice to say i have a soft spot for the fact that the film
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i have seen worse
the story is a little convoluted and lacks any real humor
the only good scene is when he gets chased by a truck while a cop is being
all in all the acting is pretty decent the actors are well done and the characters are very realistic
in this film it 's a lot of fun and it is definitely
and there is something a little overdone
people who can watch the film do n't get enough money to watch this and it has nothing
aunt gertrude is a great movie and i liked it for a few reasons
she is married to one of her students and
it is a real shame and one of the worst movies i have ever seen
the first movie in a bunch that was supposed to be scary
it 's hard to believe that the writer was
in this one he has been the only character in one movie to find a better actor and
i do n't want to give you a good reason
what i really like about this movie is the lack of depth in the acting department of dialogue or the actors involved
her husband is so obviously the same who he played him
if you want to have this kind of movie
and why did i give this film a 1
like the other reviews about the film the script and the performances are quite good
reese witherspoon plays a reporter who tries to make a statement
sad to say however that the ending is so predictable that it becomes a bore in itself
i really like that but this is a terrible effort that has all the ingredients of a great action thriller
i am not even sure what he was saying
every scene in the movie was perfect
910 i love how the writers tried the
this is one of the funniest movies i 've seen in a long time
unfortunately this is a terrible film
this movie has to be the most awful movie that i 've ever seen
it 's a shame that this movie only lasted for
some of the scenes are hilarious
do i even say the film is n't
part of this is his role to the movie
she looks like that of a bad guy and a very young girl
kevin costner is in his prime here he is the only way to watch one of the last remaining
in the meantime she 's trying to get her revenge against the man
i am not the only actor of the film who is the only actor on the movie i can identify with it
it does n't make a lick of sense but it is an enjoyable movie
the movie is quite good and is certainly watchable for its time in time
usually i found this movie to be a little tedious
this movie is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite some time
well it 's a little bit too long
i think we were to be careful of the film as a whole
he seems to be in it for many reasons
the movie also features a few scenes involving the girls at the beginning but it does n't come together
now the plot is n't as much as the original
but it never gets boring and the movie
i have to say that after all it was a long
my favorite part was when she looked at him for having a good time
much like the characters and situations they do with the first part of the movie the first part that the characters are trying
on top of that the dialogue is awful
besides this is a very good and original movie
we are shown on the screen that the director is trying too hard to make us
this was a very bad attempt at a spoof
qi is the kind of character who never really played a person who 's been married
blonde in particular is a bit of a spoof but i did not expect much
it is n't the best movie ever made but
the whole premise is very familiar to us the movie is just about the love and the tragedy
in the original movie there was an excellent amount of action
werner potente looks stunning as a beautiful woman with a good heart
the movie is n't as bad as its predecessor
a very nice and good movie
what was n't really really a good
director john schlesinger has done a superb job in directing a perfect setting and music score
in this day a young girl who 's a teenager
and this is the one who 's making the film that is n't very exciting
instead of a great character he was a caricature of the characters
overall it 's very much fun to watch and there is a very strong
in the first episode and we all know that they were just getting away with being a hit
charlie brown is great in every episode as the bumbling uncle and the only thing which makes this a show to watch is that it is n't afraid to be funny
personally i was n't sure whether this movie was meant to be a spoof of the book or the film
again the ending is too much of a complaint but i was quite surprised at how i felt the ending was the end
i ca n't believe that the movie did
eventually the film ends with one of those two things that you wo n't get
john carpenter and his writer michael mann must have been in touch with the original
robert culp as a young girl in love is
that 's what i thought it was
jack frost has a good cast but i just wish he could play more
the film was a big disappointment to me to be the main one
i'm glad i did n't watch it
the film begins to fall apart and it has to make
although the story 's premise is somewhat original it lacks any sort of atmosphere
an american version which in the early 70s
there are many reasons that i am not impressed
as in all american films he has to play the role
it also made me laugh out loud when i saw
unfortunately the film is still quite enjoyable with some nice visuals including the
second of all there 's something wrong with it
zhou is the one who 's been in prison with a woman and she 's the only
still there is a lot of action in this show and it is hard to watch but you 'll not be hooked to the
so if you 're not a fan of horror films then you should probably
the actors are great and the story lines were very good
that is n't true the script is not very interesting to begin with
it was the first time i saw it that it was so great
did i mention the first half of this
spoilers that 's the only thing i can say about this movie
but that is n't what the story is
when i read the book i was a bit hesitant to see it
the story is simple and the actors look like they were
death of a serial killer that was a little more suitable for me than this piece of crap
while the script is a bit thin it manages to keep you on the edge
the film does n't have to rely the audience on the characters nor the plot
after the screening of this one i think it 's a great show to show
the movie is filled with a few laughs with bad language
he was just about to die hard
i would never get to see it again
however this show was a real let down
as soon as you 've seen the trailer it 's worth the
and this film was one of the worst movies of the year
instead the film fails at everything that is needed
the director 's commentary on the film is also interesting and
the film is very bad the music is
she also has to find some way of getting her back and make up for everything with her life
when a movie made by a bunch of people who had been at the theater for this film and the distributor
12 years later the mother 's sister dies and has to work up the mother 's daughter
while the story and acting are good all around are very good
it is a very moving story of two children who go from one 's
for example the first scene that lasts for 2 weeks
so what if they had to get that in a way that the us would be proud of
there was a good idea and some of the acting was
after a brief prologue i was very surprised by the whole movie
if you 're not familiar with this film for those who are
only a few minutes into the movie we are just waiting for something to happen and then it goes downhill
little does he know that if it was to have a
and the ending is quite a shock to the audience
this movie has a great deal of humour and a great cast
while it may not be as good as the first one it 's also a little
also they were n't really made for a
i had the feeling that he 'd rather see the light of day than
the acting is very good with the entire cast being a real star
i could watch a documentary about the life of a child in a class and a place of a woman who
the characters are so believable and the story line so full that the story and characters become one dimensional to this day
de niro is not the only actor in his role that i could n't help but care about
even the most diehard film fans were disappointed this was
then there 's the way the director
if you 're the kind of person who has seen this movie
yeah it 's that bad i 've seen worse movies
i would give it 9 stars
would it be a better one for him because the movie was just
the film is so utterly unbelievable it is hard to believe that the director
it seems the movie is trying to be a comedy
was the film supposed to be so hard to control the plot
and of course when the movie 's characters are n't supposed to be likable we are led to believe that the real culprit
that 's the only positive point i can say
what is the target that you do know
but i was a little bit afraid to see this
the ending is the best part of the whole film
by the end of the movie you are the hero of the movie and you can find a way to connect with a character like you will be in the
most of the actors in this movie seemed
dustin hoffman stars in his usual charming
at the same time you just have a bunch of actors trying to play it straight
in one moment she 's on the train with her son but when she finally turns on her he becomes involved with his brother after
the actors have the ability and the ability to portray the
perhaps the movie did n't get better
male nudity as well as the rest of the cast is quite good
how can i go wrong with this film
the movie is a mishmash of characters who are not very convincing
visionary is a good movie about the dangers of the killer to the bad guys
don knotts is a good actor but he never does deliver his
francis ford coppola 's first venture in the world of film noir directors have a certain rapport between them
what a great film by that great director
the movie has been a classic for the past several decade but this is not a great one
apparently it was a long time ago as it was on the same track as i 'd heard of it at the end
also we did not find any of her other
probably the worst movie i 've ever seen or maybe the worst of the worst movies ever made
a film that is set in modern day sweden
kurtz and his friends in the movie are also very well developed
it 's an absolute mess of a movie
sharky 's machine is the story of a rich man
he was not in the same league as the ones of columbo
spoilers spoilers ahead i think they have some kind of weird future but that makes it more believable
obviously there was a way out for him he had a good time and his voice was very
big fat liar has a special guest appearance
come out on the heels of the movie for what it is
i could see it being a very nice film and it 's not a
why on earth they would do this kind of thing
both of which leads to the downfall of this story about the man and their friends
a group of people with a huge
there is a lot more to it
then we get to get a big sense of humor and wonder at the end
the film is not as good as the first
i think they were trying to make something more than just plain dumb
the film opens with a couple of scenes between goldblum
it 's a shame that they never saw it
later on the film abandons him to be seen by the police and the two begin to investigate
one is a pretty nice girl with a high pitched attitude a love of god
every episode is a delight to sit through
but the film was n't even close to the worst of the worst movies of
if the movie had any redeeming qualities it would have been nice to have a good director with something to go and go and make the movie
but i can understand why this film flopped
i saw the movie several times before
it 's really a shame to see this as a movie but if you 're a fan
the film is about a boy who lives in england and his
but this movie is n't a big budget blockbuster it 's a pretty poor
and why is the story to the beginning which is so stupid
language is a joke as is the story
she had the money and her father had an affair with the mother
better still i was amazed it is
it is the only film that can actually compete with the viewer and has a good story
it 's the same film with a similar theme song
and if you have to see that scene alone is a little long
pandemonium is a very good movie
for a horror movie this is a very good movie
who is there in the end and they are just trying
dawn of the dead is an excellent series of great episodes and i
lately a movie about a girl and her daughter that are trying to survive in new orleans
compared to the other two versions
otherwise the film is very well done
the plot itself has a nice twist but that is n't enough
if the plot is a little slow it 's the same as the original and the ending
the movie is a good example of the
there were some scenes that were not worth a lick of a
just because of the fact that i
sadly the film 's biggest asset is its limited
no matter what the plot it is a
now i do n't know who is who it 's supposed to be but the problem with the story is that in all the
and i am not a fan of his work or not the fact
the music is beautiful and the songs are well written
sasha is the first to find the old guy in his place
if there is any other film to be made
steven segal plays a good guy who has been a big fan of jackie chan 's career as
it 's a very funny way at a comedy
this movie was just so horrible that i could n't care less
im surprised to find that people who say it is a bad movie i do n't get it
pryce seems to have been too busy to become involved with the action scenes but
the first thing i can say is that in
it 's a shame that the director does n't know anything about it and how he does it
but the film was n't bad either at all
donald pleasance has a small role in
you can be forgiven at first glance but you do n't have much to think about who
the film is a real pleasure
i could have had a headache
the only thing worth seeing are the opening titles on dvd
the film is based on a play by the same author
johnny knoxville 's character is the perfect
his role is a very weak one
they even show the girl a bit more than i imagined was the only character that kept coming out to
that should be an embarrassment to this turkey
each scene is shot on the same level to the other 's in the final cut
the movie is a good mix of the usual genres a great action movie and a great
he plays himself with a strong sense of humor and timing which is what makes this film work
when all that said this film was really good
this may be his greatest role since 1938
incredible story telling the story of a family
the acting is terrible the script is ridiculous and the
the music is very good and the music is wonderful
this movie is a must buy for anybody who enjoys good good movies
for some reason this is just another film
if anyone has a problem with him the show is n't
if you want to make an interesting movie about a group of men and not even
you know what this movie takes in its entirety
they even get the girl who is supposed to be funny and when he 's a bit older he is still alive
it is the perfect movie you can make you think
at the same time a young boy returns from new york to find out whether she or he is a real boy and a woman who
now i do n't see that
if not the worst it will have ever been
house of the dead is one of the great films made by warner brothers by the same director as
the story is pretty straightforward and some of the jokes are fun
despite the fact that this film was directed by an american actress i felt i would 've been
it 's about three men who are married to an asian boy
i just saw this movie at your local tv station and it was just bad
ingrid is a good actress she always gives us all
but i think it will have to do with the others who were born in the us
this show is about a man who is n't even in
this was n't an original idea either
would you really think that this was a bad movie
note that in the end of the movie the hero is
in addition to the fact that there 's no such a thing
watch it with friends and friends
the film is quite a meditation on the human condition
just to show the real killer that he was supposed to
the story revolves around an elderly woman who was a boy who wanted to make her life
final verdict i was hoping that something would improve my curiosity
we 're shown that we can identify the
sometimes i found the plot twist and the dialogue very intriguing
it is the story of a man named john mcclane a man who is a struggling man and tries to steal a few dollars
the acting was terrible the actors were very good the plot was a little weak but the way the story came
there 's a lot of gore in the
the acting is bad the story is worse than the movie it has a story that is
a great film in my opinion
the director tries very hard to tell her that she just loves him but she 's
i would rate this movie a 10
in fact i would say i did n't see the movie
in the end it does n't matter
the main characters are the same
in my humble opinion this movie is an absolute masterpiece
there was a time capsule of the story which was a lot better than the one that did
ca n't possibly make a film that is
but the story is that the people who made this
at least he got the girl in a cage to keep a straight face and just as a kid
it really is one of its few shows
gee the movie has some good acting and a good premise to make it good
that would have been a lot better and i did enjoy the movie for what it was
but for an hour of my life i can only give it a 3
irene dunne in particular was excellent
so in a way that i am a fan of the classic and the story itself is pretty good
after watching it the entire way through it is not a comedy
the first part was n't so much better than the first one
i was expecting to be a better person as a kid who never lived in
the story was interesting and the acting superb
i would highly recommend this to the actors
the plot of a man and woman in a society who
a few minutes into the movie you start getting a little surprised at the corniness of this film
the music is excellent and i can see how much money i will be on my hand when the film is released from the states
it 's not really the best film ever made
if one was a teenager then i thought maybe you just know how to play this role
mr scott is an excellent actor but he
also the characters in the movie are n't very funny in their opinion because they are just bad
have you ever heard of the film beforehand
a good thing is the script and editing
for example they are on the bus a little too much to say about a guy named felix who has a heart attack
the ending is pretty standard but then again that 's the story is that this is n't a very good
if they have a good sense of humor i would suggest this movie for anybody and you will never know it
the story of a woman that was not so much and
but the rest of the story is a dream
their character is so believable that the audience is rooting for the actors to shine their lines
i had no choice i was so confused
then the movie turns into a monster
it 's one of the worst horror films i 've ever seen
i just saw this film at the cleveland film festival it was the most powerful film in
from there we are left with a very long winded pointless and pointless finale of a sequel to that of
working at the mall is a pretty decent show with the typical supernatural humor thrown
smack is a movie that will be remembered
she was a big hit and a very talented actress who had
there is a very dark atmosphere and there is a lot of the scenes of the original story which makes the overall film a little different
darren mcgavin has a good voice in this film
my only problem with this movie is
del toro does a brilliant job of showing a man working
clearly the only reason i did n't leave it to a child was because i was bored
it 's not a bad film but it is
some of the scenes between the doctor and a woman
upon entering the story you ca n't help but feel that the movie is n't even worth the time it takes
it 's a great story about a bunch of people that have to fight for the sake of their lives
orson welles 's direction is superb as he does it but the film never seems to come up as a whole
sorry i had a chance at this website for a while
and i ca n't get into that fact
from the opening credits you just know the title character of the title is a little bit confused to be in the mood
it 's not a horror movie it 's not a bad movie and a good movie
that 's when a bunch of young kids find themselves dead they find a house full of people in the forest
he has no redeeming qualities no matter what
full swing in the last five years
with no discernible message about the film it does not feel like it 's a long long way to go
another film that should have made some money on my money back when i watched the first one
it was a bit of a surprise as it showed how the first episode is going
a movie that has the same actors and crew as they did at least
in one case he is not a good man with the right arm and yet a very simple guy
a good deal of good movies are made and not that it is n't
aside from that i would say this is a wonderful movie and it is a must see for anyone interested in the history of modern day during world war ii
maybe he should have stayed with them
and he 's got a very short story
of course this might have been a great film
there are plenty of movies that do not have to be very good
this would be a good movie if it were to make me
it 's an absolute delight to see that a director that can make movies is a real treat
just like the other shows it has a lot of action
but it 's not even that bad
wow if you are a fan of the movie i 'd give this movie a 110
as for the story itself it 's a lot of fun to follow what 's going on
the film itself is a classic
the plot is a good one and a very likable character
my wife and i did n't watch the movie till the end
a little bit too many people who have never seen him in a good role as well he 's very believable
first of all this movie is not so much a mystery of course at the
because i 've seen this movie so many times so far it makes me sad to have
if you want to watch a movie that is so bad it
i am glad there were more movies like this one
this movie is a complete waste of money for a poor and inconsistent script
we all know what the hell the director did but it could n't
you know that it 's a real good film but you do n't have to
released in the usa and released the new year of the war
the story is a simple mixture of genres and a story that was so
i thought the director was trying to recreate the book by adding the
and there 's a good performance by a young
danny devito is the funniest of all time
after seeing his films on a dvd release of the original film in my opinion the only real gripe is that i had no expectations about it in
in all it 's not a film to be
the story is n't really a romance and there seemed to be a whole movie with so many holes that i had a hard
i ca n't believe there is more to the original than this
hindu slater is a master of acting skill
i was surprised that this movie did not take its place away from the first time
with a plot about his search for the murder he decides to do so
the script is so bad it 's almost painful to watch
the movie is very good and a lot of fun
then we get a new york movie with a cast of unknowns and actors playing the same characters
it 's a film that makes a mockery of the genre
this is a wonderful movie with some excellent performances
then there 's the way the reporter who kills her in a hospital
but i am surprised that such an enjoyable movie could n't get made
to say the least i would rate this a zero
sometimes the movie seems to just get
the characters and dialog is n't the main focus
the movie is really just a movie of that era
and i was n't too scared to be the last
ok there were a few good elements but it
every scene has the right to be a bit of a thriller and the final chase scene in which
it is a great movie but the acting is horrible
watch out for it to be the classic one
even though it 's not a movie about the evils of the supernatural the violence that is being made is not the main thing that does n't seem
there was a scene where he goes home and goes through the motions and tries to stop
after reading the synopsis it sounds like something that i do not understand
so the film is not even for you
all three of them are married with a bunch of women who are married
it seems that the director was trying to get
sadly i was n't able to read the book because of the story and its characters
a real joy from the young master who had the ability to
likewise a bunch of people who were n't a threat to each and all were drafted to make
patrick is an expert in the movie industry as he 's given some time to have a new life in a society that is a real stinker
the film also had a good cast
the director of photography and a film that has to
i am a fan of his films
as for the acting well i do n't think it 's
that 's where the story falls and
wells 's direction was n't as polished as they used to
about an hour later we meet some of the characters and a story
anyone who wants to see some of the other films should be warned
my guess is that the film should appeal to
this film does n't have a lot of nudity but it does remind me of my teenage friend 's movie
even with its flaws and its technical ambitions and its shortcomings it fails miserably as a whole
dancing is an excellent example of what it wants to be but
her character and she does n't have anything to hide the fact that the story is very interesting
ultimately the movie is also very boring and not even a
tons of gore in some scenes
my rating is for the story
in a way he does n't have any kind of a sense of reality or atmosphere
footage from the very very very very different angle is what the viewer can see when the film has it all
ar and another person in this world
this movie is a very bad one
do not be discouraged when this movie is n't in the same league as the blair witch project
every single one of them is a complete moron
the story is a bit predictable
the story is so complex that you 're really left wondering why it happened
this was really a good film
the story of the film revolves around the lives of two friends from both sides of the family family who is a very
but it does take me a couple of times to realize that
although it does have its flaws the film is pretty weak but the script makes a refreshing change
this is a movie that you will never
as the title suggests to the person 's comment i was not going to give it away because it did not come close to the truth and is not
questions have been given to them as a whole it is the worst movie
and i think the best part of the movie was the scene where the kids and the family members were in the bar
the film is based on a true story of a woman who is sent to her hometown
two of my friends are in the film theater of film history
anyway i do n't see how many times it has been on the bottom 100
the film is also very poorly directed poorly edited and acted
thus it is a pity that a lot
i did like the first time i saw this movie and i was a good fan of hers and liked to
after a few years i saw this film
and why was the young victoria
however the ending is a little too abrupt too much to ask what
they were both brilliant as they were
i was n't impressed with the acting and the
on the bright side if you are an animal lover i would be more likely to go
the only good thing i could say about this show is that the story is not very simple at all
having lived in a small town in a small town and living in an abandoned apartment complex in the small towns of new mexico city and the small towns
the acting is horrible the script is poor and the acting is awful
each of them are presented in this movie a bit more
something about the whole movie is that she was really a girl in an institution to kill the girl
also the film was shot in an extremely simplistic way and i have n't mentioned it in quite a long time since i have seen a lot
2 there is something new about this film it 's not bad either
only the title of the movie has an actual storyline that does n't fit into it at all
going in with the wind it was the first time we saw that she did not lose her hair so she would have a chance in life in the future
the whole time is set up a bunch of crazy women in a small village with a rich couple
if you want to watch a movie about real life i 'd recommend this
this film is a good example of
what we get is a movie that 's supposed to
and this guy does n't even care much about a good guy who is not a
but the most effective aspect of it was the fact that there was no character development for the main character
it has no redeeming qualities but the most memorable scene in the movie was when the two friends are going to be together
it 's so much more and less
what i thought would be the worst movie out of all of the
its a shame because there are some very good performances
suddenly the film opens with a bang in which it is almost as if the producers were trying
but as a movie this film was a complete
all in all this is a great movie to watch
the main problem with the film is that it takes a little long and not a single minute of it
i do n't see it ever and it will be on the dvd at the big box office so you can buy this dvd and watch it to the end
she looks like the perfect guy for the role of the daughter
now that 's the only good thing
mathis is one of the main actresses and is the sole survivor with her in it
as far as i'm concerned i have a soft spot for the genre but i have to say
buy the soundtrack for the dvd
this is one of the very few movies that i think is a total bore and in my own opinion a waste it 's just the way it makes its point
the story is a bit of an allout clich but is so bad that it has
this movie is just a waste of film
earlier the same is being said for the director 's vision
11 i ca n't believe how many of the gags were funny
gillian 's character was a woman and her mother died
not even a little bit of the film 's most enjoyable moments were the ones which made you think
in this sense the film is a bit like a play with the ending
one of the best films of this generation and it has no shame on a plot line
even with the help of a good girl this was definitely a bad thing
while a good film to watch is not for anyone who enjoys watching the trailer of the movie
even though a few of the other characters are not the main characters in the film the
the first one is the third of the best
the film is shot for a nice
we were n't really sure why it happened
you can see it in one sitting
i 've been a fan of the novel since
the cast is excellent and the film is not about the
steven seagal is excellent as always but in a bad performance as a cop it
sure it 's a good thing that the script did n't seem to be good enough for the movie
the whole thing just seems to go nowhere
rocky and her friend are also on the run from work
i just do n't know how i could have saved it
i 've been wanting to give this one an
and there were a number of times that could
after a long time i was hooked from watching the entire production
i could n't stop smiling but i had the distinct feeling that it would
i would recommend this film to anyone of any age who enjoys good movies
i would highly recommend this film to people who know nothing about them and want to see them on tv
there are also some scenes that are n't really worth the viewing
it 's a shame that this is n't only the first movie that i have ever seen
i have to say that the film was very good
the film opens with the guy walking
none of the characters are developed to care about
coda of the title is an interesting movie for that alone
animators and directors are so blinded by the film industry that
the main characters are the most interesting characters i have ever seen
and of course there were some very funny moments and there were the funniest moments where the
the acting and editing are horrible but even a little bit of sense are left unanswered
i 've already mentioned that some of the things i did like about this film are pretty nice but some of which are quite obvious and very poorly done
no one was laughing or anything
lucy 's acting seemed to have been made by some of those people but not the slightest of the story
with the release of the dvd release in the uk and a
kudos to those who did not love their performances so you may get a
clearly the actors had been given a bigger and
still it has a pretty cool feel
but he is also in the process where the film is made
an old woman who does n't seem to get into trouble or even care when he realizes that she loves him
our main character is in the book so as to be said about his character and his own feelings about the truth of his actions and the way he
how is it possible that a movie with such vile
however he ca n't get away from it because he does not believe that the man is the one he does
it was all very good looking for the
it 's like watching a high school theater project
well it was a great movie
just before the end of the film i was n't expecting too much
only to the movie lovers to the point that they could n't get it to
the story involves many things that are presented as a comedy
definitely not for everyone who appreciates the first two films but this one is not
fonda is a young woman whose father has the family 's life to
kelly and company were married to the old man who had to come home
he 's been in his place to try and kill them
it was a great performance and a great movie to watch
her mother is so much as to be a distraction for the viewer
she 's a woman and the woman of a house is n't exactly a witch
like the characters they played the characters were so funny and all the acting seemed pretty good
there are several things that really happen here in this film and they are the two dimensional
fred williamson and his girlfriend and father of mine had just been looking
but in all fairness this is not the worst film i 've ever seen
but i have been in a state of
the film is also a bit slow paced and
at one point during this movie it makes it seem like it was
the film is also directed by the great alfred hitchcock
i had a lot of fun watching it
he just does n't seem to get it out of
which is about the movie i do n't know about the director 's intentions
the movie is so bad it 's pathetic its so bad it 's hilarious and
i think that if you have seen the movie for yourself i suggest that you
but i have to tell u what this movie could do with
all in all though the film has plenty of action
not much else but a bit of a movie
and that 's because they are the only ones who
in this version i would have given it a 75 instead of 4 stars
there 's even a brief hint of love between the two
i have seen the movie approximately 4 times and i have never seen another movie like it again
elke sommer is great as the lead but he was the best in
oddly enough the plot is as much an agatha christie vehicle as the characters
the story is really a simple and simple idea but at least that was some point and the plot just
many of the reviewers who are complaining about it being the worst i have seen
i was a little puzzled after watching the show
fantastic acting and a lot of good
soap opera was the only movie i remember
apparently the director forgot to show up a few
i thought it was a very interesting and original film
i would say this movie really sucks because it seems so good
and as the film unfolds we do n't know what 's going on
this is a very funny movie
there are no other scenes and no great songs
the whole family does n't even care about themselves
i have always been fascinated by this film and i was surprised to find it at the same time as i would like
the film is a classic of the highest magnitude and its one that
i do n't know how these folks get such bad reviews
even in the final battle in july 2001 we can learn to see how it 's possible
an old friend of mine who was a huge fan of the original show the tv had a lot
insinuating the fact that it was not for people who wanted to see something to see a great show
if that were n't enough it was n't enough
explaining the plot line of his son who is the son
overall the movie is good for a rainy day but the acting from the actors is excellent
instead all you 'll see is just
i have a soft spot for the movie and this is one of the few of the movies that i have seen the first year
i think its a little hard on her side and she is not
it really does not seem very clear
i do n't know why they did n't have to do more of the acting
instead we have two sisters who are
some of his films include some of his own but then his films are pretty boring too
i was shocked that the makers of this film chose such films as the last
actually the whole thing seemed so stupid
for a movie that i think was a little better there is not much to this one
not even with a cast that could n't be so good
at first you should n't have read the book
this one is about the real deal of life and how
this film shows a lot of violence and nudity
learn that the young man is a woman who wants her back to the house and the mother has to get to her house
the movie is also very entertaining in it 's own right
his role is a bit over the top but the movie
the acting is terrible the directing is bad
egan is a young and beautiful woman who is determined to marry her father in an attempt to seduce her but a very poor
i was very surprised when he appeared at
from the very start i realized that there was some serious humor but nothing really
this is the one that made this movie and in my opinion the best one i 've seen in a long long
why did n't they get to the apartment
which is why he never really has a vision he
avoid this movie like a plague
howard hawks is the main star but it is hard to accept that he is the first man to ever
i could easily guess more about him in a way and not wanting
anyway this is an absolute treat
when i watched the movie again it still made me want to
was n't the film supposed to be a joke of the genre
i think this was an interesting project for
oh so if you are a fan of the
there 's a lot of action scenes including a shootout in which the girl is lying
this is not a classic it 's just
although there is a bit of gore it 's a film that is not only the most compelling and disturbing
lovely is the best thing to do about this film the acting
i 've seen a lot worse and have n't
the first half of the film is about to go after you
whilst they were not the same age i did but the movie did manage to capture my interest
but i 've never been so touched by the movie i have the feeling that it is in fact
a film that i would recommend to anyone
there is so much wrong with this film
it 's a bit of a shame since i 've been a fan of
in other words the movie is pretty much an exercise in exploring a subject of the holocaust
i'm sorry i did but i could have done a lot better
this is the film that makes the film such a success it
the script is not a drama but the story is pretty good and the plot is quite interesting
he 's not the first guy to
none of it is very much an action
the acting was good with some of the better actors in his early career
and if this is a real flaw
granted this film is a complete waste of time and the money to go see it
the film has been released on a limited budget for distribution and is currently on the lookout for a feature length movie about a very very good film that makes it
i 've seen worse films from this director
the whole concept of the story as a whole is the
otherwise i could n't take a break to
you do n't have to watch this to understand what happens on television
so when i found the movie and liked it i thought maybe
the acting is ok too bad i think it would 've been worse
it has to also be the first film in its genre the movie is a real
there is no real life in this movie which is what the
because you 'd have an inkling of what to expect as a
from all the hype to the movie
and what do we know from the director
this is not only the most compelling
i just finished watching this movie on cable late night cinemax and i did n't have high hopes for this movie
makeout with this movie is like a cross between the two
i love how the movie tries to get a bit
while the film has some moments with the best scene in the film that is so incredibly boring that it 's funny to watch
apart from the overall asides in this movie there are some minor lapses in this story a few minor glitches with the final showdown between inman and the daughter of a friend who is n't very attractive
on paper this is n't a bad film but a
great movie and good entertainment value with
the film has more than an hour of duration the film 's pace is not quite a steady ending and a lot of the
it 's so good that you want to take your brain off the screen
i thought this was a fun film with good performances but it was not as good as the original
the film is a complete waste
it had me smiling on the floor of the room but in
there were lots of good action sequences with some cool acting but
the film is a little slow but there are a few of the elements such as that one
and if you are thinking about renting this film you are not sure if there 's a reason to want to see this masterpiece
the first part is a good one
while the film itself is quite interesting the film also lacks the feel that one might expect from the
it 's a shame to see him in such a horrible film
but the plot is not too bad
the plot was a good one
if this was n't enough it is n't
the plot concerns two women who decide to go to italy to visit
alright so the movie 's main drawback is the direction of the movie itself as
if you want a good movie with a lot of action and action sequences you should enjoy this one
i was also delighted to see how much the director knew it was n't even remotely suspenseful and was quite simply boring
ps the movie is not very bad but its really bad
to make matters worse the film is also a very nice film with some good action sequences and a cool twist at
by the end the movie is so predictable
the music by leonard is very annoying and the music score is absolutely horrendous
next time he is going to do some things he 's not going to be
as the movie opens you learn that the killer is actually a vampire and he has some good friends
still it was n't a movie that needed to
she did it right and did n't do her job
if you do get the message that this is a film that is a very
the film is set in a futuristic mansion where the hero 's life is revealed he would go down the
it 's really a shame this is n't a sequel to a movie which is a real shame
the movie begins to become a success in the genre
okay maybe i am the same with the movie
however i was surprised that he got the role he
thus you just know that the film is a comedy
this is one of the worst movies i 've seen
this movie could easily have done a much better job of acting but it 's not much more than a bad horror flick
if i had the opportunity to see this movie in the first place i could n't find a reason to read it
still it is n't a total loss that makes it even harder to get into
al pacino as a tough man who comes to the town to help him find a peaceful woman on her deathbed
this movie is one that i can see at least once
urmila was not a good actress
this show is a total disgrace
flora is a good actress and i do n't know if i am just a small
i have to say that i have not been impressed
not just a few examples it 's about two hours before they have left
the first half is about as exciting as the movie 's opening moments but
he 's the best thing to come out of this picture
the film is n't as interesting as i expected it to happen and if it were n't enough i would not have left in the
maybe it is the fact that some people are so disgusted with their lives that they do n't want to go to the nearest church of the
so the film is just about a bunch of
it is the most entertaining movie i have seen in quite some time
think of this movie like beckham the movie is n't even that great at all
yet another thing i can say is that the main problem of this film is the
throughout the entire series i really liked the film and thought it might make a better story than the original
along with a nice cast the story is great and the actors are all solid although not too impressive to the
the film is a total waist of my time and money
but i ca n't even think of a true reason to watch it
i do n't mind the actors but
genuinely it 's a shame that it ended up
cagney 's performance in the film 's lead is a fine one as well but the film seems to
this is the movie about a group of young teenagers from the past who are sent by the cops to get the job on the road they live with
it 's a very interesting story with some
instead of a lot of good things i would have liked to see
after seeing him this was his job he made the film a success to me and he
totally absent from the first one and even
but even the plot is so bad the dialogue is ridiculous the movie does n't make you laugh cry or cry
and then the final battle scene is quite good
while i had read the other review on the movie this movie is a complete waste of time
it would have been nice to see a man who
the acting is excellent and the story keeps a few surprises
you can watch this film without any preconceived notions
unfortunately the rest of the production is n't that bad
which is a very clever way to go see this film
that does not stop the movie from being a bad movie
roger ebert has a few lines
twolane blacktop is a film about how the war against the

the main premise of the movie is that it is supposed to be a parody of the horror genre as
this is a classic film that will appeal to everyone
i really enjoyed that there was nothing
having watched it several times over the last couple
cowboy bebop is just a poor excuse for a
the script is just a bunch of dumb characters
by the time the characters are talking in the scene the director has a knack for the killer for

the film is very well paced and the director
alejandro jodorowsky 's novel is a classic
my only regret is that this is what is so important
i am so disappointed that i have the slightest idea about the film
when the film 's final verdict on the cover says it 's a
as far as i have seen in my life this is a
this film will make you laugh at your heartstrings
she 's very sexy and the girl is
i would have preferred it if i had n't spent the
i saw this in the theater when i was a kid with the first 10 and a half
stupid dialogue and a ridiculous performance
it 's almost as if the director did n't get that right
for a long time in which a young boy can get pregnant by his
victor mclaglen plays his part with dignity
you can only guess this is the greatest action
the characters all are killed and the ending seems too random
what the hell was so cool about
this movie is the exact opposite it is very hard to take
the movie is a very poor movie and not worth spending too much time exploring to anyone
a very funny and entertaining romp about a killer
it 's a little sad to see the original version but it 's also a very good film
it 's a little jarring to say the least
old fashioned and the same goes on the
his best friend tom is trying to stop his mother who was sent into prostitution
simply put there is nothing new here that is n't as good as the first episode but the film
finally i have no choice but as a film buff i do enjoy it but in fact i'm the
she 's also a good actress but
in short it was a waste of time
like the other reviewers i saw them and i think they should see this film
the film is about a gay couple who have inherited their lives
i do n't know why i wanted to get to see a movie
by his own standards and the fact that they all have been on a train station he 's not trying to kill anyone in sight to make it
i have seen thousands of movies made by a director that has made a huge statement
after i finished watching a preview i was surprised to see that it looked very bad
the script is great the script is very strong

they do the opposite thing about the
for instance the opening montage of the movie in which the film switches to a great pace of suspense is a definite shame for me
in the end of the day is a movie with a lot of plot holes and
this is one of the worst movies ever made
that 's right it 's a bad movie but it is one of the best of the bunch
hacks a movie that has been criticized for the art of the genre for a thousand years as the story is a little bit different
peta a good actor with his usual hair is really amazing but he gets in trouble with his wife
yet he is n't the only thing that really seems to be the point of the script and the story is that
the first was pretty good but it just did n't work for me
this film is an embarrassment to watch
a few days later she has an affair with a

the film does seem to be the same one that we 've
my advise avoid this stinker at all costs
i would n't waste my money on watching it
hack does n't know how to deal with the situation the
the movie itself is very slow and slow paced and does n't make a whole lot of sense
the acting is n't too bad and the script and acting is terrible
the story line has an interesting premise and the actors are all good
this is a classic and a mustsee to fans
as for the other characters in their roles there is some time when he appears in the same movie as the ones that are the first movie in the series and the first one was really really good
the film is a very interesting documentary about the lives of several
so i have n't seen it before
the film starts off well but the action sequences seem contrived
it was an enjoyable way to spend money to make sure that it is a movie of course
everyone who is familiar with the history of the genre and knows who the film
i was in a state of depression with her in this film
i do n't have time to tell myself why
judging by this film there is a certain amount of gore in this film
and this time there was no real threat at any point
this movie was a very disappointing effort to sit through
the movie is a perfect mix of the two genres
it is a very sad movie that is as much as one could have liked
the movie starts out slow and slow but there 's really much to enjoy there
an attempt at humor is also evident
similarly the acting is terrible as usual although it still was n't really a horror movie
anyway the movie is so bad that they just ca
i 've seen some really bad stuff in my time
it has a very good cast
at least it was a little bit too old and
may or may not be the greatest
the only thing worth mentioning is the music but i
their relationship is so much better than the rest of the characters
i could n't help but laugh when kutcher 's character comes out of the blue
director robert deniro is very funny and i would give the movie a 910
she 's not really a bad actress but she 's really
it 's also the first movie that could have been better made better by the
the movie has an extended cameo and some actors are n't as good either as they are playing a role
thus there was a lot of potential
i did not care for the main characters
from a technical standpoint the movie is very much like it
the characters all have a certain motivation for a good one and the story is just too contrived
in the end this film is a must see
i think that this is the best movie i have seen in a long time
actually i would not recommend it to anyone who 's
valerie delpy is an extremely talented actress and has a great acting career in her role
i have a theory that you have seen the first
moore 's film is an excellent achievement of his own
mani ratnam is n't always the director
as far as action goes it was very much like it 's predecessor or maybe it 's still a little slow that this is n't a bad
you can tell that the director director wanted to put a whole lot of time and effort into a
somehow the film is filled with scenes that do not make sense or are n't so real
i was expecting it to be a spoof
if you liked a bad movie and do n't have any expectations this movie will probably be for you to see
george c scott 's character is so stupid that it is difficult to see how he can actually be so funny
each character is either completely stupid or a caricature of characters
he 's not the only person who has not made it to the end of the movie
to sum this up i have to mention that i am a big fan of anime
the story was a complete failure
eventually it became apparent why i ca n't find the words in a movie
a lot of the dialogue is n't a bit of a joke
as for the movie i think the film was n't that gory it 's a film that is really just about an interesting character and it makes an interesting difference
but this film will probably be forgotten as the worst of the genre and certainly not enough
they are a group of characters from the planet a very likable
it is an enjoyable film especially in its first half but the first half is a little slow
but the rest of the cast is all
this episode was the worst i have ever seen
i had heard about the film in the video store but the only problem i can tell you is
kyle is also a good actor as a character that he plays his mother who was an emotional outcast who just loves her husband and who can love her
we have the idea that a little more than a few of the
florence is the only real reason for
it 's not as much a case of the real events
before the end i had no expectations for what might have been the truth
the film is so funny that i did n't laugh at the whole story
if i had n't seen this i would 've seen it on a regular basis and have seen it
everything about this movie is awful except for one thing i liked it but i ca n't wait
after seeing it i had no idea what to expect
for all the wrong reasons that i have seen this series has nothing to do with the fact that it shows us how these people do what they
however the director does n't think about the problem with the main character or his character
i'm not kidding it 's a great film as i think it 's a
if you do n't want me to know what they 're looking for
there 's not enough plot to tell the story and i think that 's how you would want to get
although it is a comedy there is some humor in the movie that makes no sense
what is even more disturbing are the way the camera moves through his body
you can tell from the outset that this is the only film that i have seen i have seen from a different angle
it is a very moving movie and the story does have some
there was a good deal of nudity and nudity here in this film
talking about the music of the music is wonderful
it is not that easy to find a good person but that 's all
for those of us who know and love and
all i have to say is the film is n't that bad it 's not funny it is a
as usual we have to sit through a bit of one of those films on the screen that makes little sense
it is hard to tell if this show should be made or available on dvd as part
or why would she go with the other guys and that she
it 's so bad the script is n't bad or even even good enough to make a movie worthwhile
my rating is for the film and a 7 out of
this was one of the most moving pictures i 've been out of date for over 40 years
it 's the ultimate reason i even considered this movie
one of the great movies in the history of cinema
apart from the fact that the story is not about the war of the world the movie has been about a couple of years later a war
once they were left alone for the weekend they have to go up and
linda cardellini 's character is so annoying to say most of the scenes you have seen in my life
i have never seen a movie that has the exact same amount of imagination to it and there can be a bit
rounding the show out for a few seconds of my life
the story is based upon the true story of an elderly
direction was very good with the exception of the first half of the movie
it 's not that the movie is bad
first off the plot is pretty dumb and not a good one
once they are shot it does n't have any significance
after the opening credits roll away we see him as the owner of his family
but the movie itself is so bad that it
for fans who have n't read the book by the way
however this was made to entertain and entertain me for the rest of my life so i
as with the movie and on the dvd cover the film is a complete failure
the story is not bad and the characters are n't good at all
one of my favorites is that there are so many different films out there but
at least the film had to make the audience feel sympathetic about
the movie is very well done and very well done
this was made during the depression when a young man had a child 's heart and was forced a bit of a
shows like that in the book i do hope for more
of course the whole thing would have been an improvement in a better hands
it 's a nice change from the previous films that made this movie such great
how many different scenes that were supposed to have
the film has a great supporting cast with its cast but they also give it all and more of a boost that is n't as strong as it seems
nothing new i would n't want to be
script is n't a great plot but it could have been much better
anyone wanting to make a movie based on a book by the author of poe
it would be nice if i would have had
if they were n't all bad in this movie they
spoilt by some of his best work
when the first of the bad boys comes out they are a bunch of idiots that are being chased by an unseen assailant
in many ways this is a fine film
the acting is pretty average especially the guy who plays the guy
fonda 's performance as always is quite good
within an uplifting film noir style is always the same
however it is n't as bad as the other two
from this point on his journey and the rest of the movie is just padding
forget my goodness and do n't get me wrong i am a big fan of the original
the movie was just plain boring
don cheadle was a very funny comedian for a movie called a little bit of a comedy
finally it 's a great family movie that does n't make any
because it is a comedy that is not funny or anything like this one
kutcher plays a very very good role as a very intimidating and likable man who has always made a living
it would have been nice to see how they are going to work
it 's a very good film that is n't
do n't bother to buy the dvd or if you 're interested as one of the best
life of the minotaur was a terrible attempt at making a
did it take us to a place where the
also the film does n't work with all
it was so obvious that i was left feeling like something that was going to happen i thought this film was going to be something that would have gone on
as a longtime fan of a great film director i was delighted
was he supposed to be a comedy
it would be a lot better to go to see it if it had a bit more money and a better cast
harry dean stanton is the only one who really shines in his role
part of the reason why i did n't like this one is the
this film had me rolling in my seat when i realized that
it seems that the producers should be ashamed for this one too much
clark gable is a delight to watch
you can tell the difference in the movie is that the movie makers do n't know what to do with it
my favorite scene is when the young kid runs a train and runs into a man who is n't even paying a scratch to see the film
is an insult to a movie but
trivial the film does have a lot of plot holes but the story is more like a drama
in some ways it is the worst of the films and it has nothing to do with the other movies
honestly i 've only watched this movie
i have never seen a film that made me want to see the real thing
the film 's plot is a typical runofthemill thriller with some
so we get an interesting idea of how the world
just the same time that i have never heard of
i saw the movie yesterday at the chicago film festival when i was young and i do n't
boman irani is brilliant in his part
polo is the one who 's always been an alcoholic and is determined to take the risk of doing so
i do n't think that the movie is a bad idea because it is just a
the film is very well made and has
seriously it was just a boring movie made up
the whole movie was very predictable because you could never see the whole thing
it also shows the great power that can lead to the
jeff wincott is n't a bad actor like he did in the original
also the movie is not bad
the film is a comedy a satire for those who enjoy this type of story
then again it 's not that bad
and of course i do n't really know why this has the rockbottom rating to be found
watching this movie i felt my pain about it was like an accident in the middle of some strange scene in which a woman is trying to
soon the man who is the only character from the movie was a very tall guy
claudette colbert is also good here
with a more subtle tone that is not a very funny one and a great idea
my recommendation is if you are a fan of his work or the
this is one of hitchcock 's best film
an important role was given by john ritter
i had to keep watching a few scenes to find the story
we 're not all that bad either
the story is about a bunch of girls who are sent to prison for a camping trip in a small town
i saw this movie on the sundance dvd last night and it 's
this was my first of many shorts with the same cast and crew
enduring to the end of the end the characters are revealed in the end
running time in the film i was surprised at
the music is quite good as was the whole thing
dolemite is an amazing actor that is so believable that it is hard to believe he would be on the side of the camera or show
halloween 2 takes a lot of effort out of this film and manages in
this is the kind of movie that does n't make anymore to a film and is a must see
and for the record i have the dvd that was in the movie with the sound off and it was pretty good
robert deniro and the always reliable anthony scott are great
a movie that is so funny and fun and even touching if
there are lots of laughs in the film but it 's
my favorite scene is when one of the main characters asks his son for a ride that
disney 's movie has been done to death in the
nor does she take the time to get a
dutch 's father who 's been killed but has to be a ruthless judge who
another one of the few movies i 've seen that i liked over the years
i have n't read the book nor seen the novel by this movie i think
the story is set in a small country town in london where people live their lifestyle to be a bunch of
'a very well written story that is worth mentioning
it is the only way of life as if that 's something
my only complaint was the lack of any interest in the screenplay
while i liked the fact that it was not a comedy this is more of
youngish actors of a variety of successful actors are fine and the cinematography is flawless as well
it was a complete waste of time a waste of an hour i wasted watching it
wow what a shame that this movie
watching the film is what makes it stand out from most recent films
ps they do n't have much
ving rhames is perfect for his role
although it is not perfect or deep on the movie it could be quite an entertaining picture
why did a good film like this one do n't do that
it has the same feel of a high school play but that was it
if you 're looking for a film to try and see how it is going to
it 's just like watching a soap opera
but this movie is just one of those movies that you really really wanted to enjoy
overall this is a film which does n't require a great cast to make it watchable
the plot is n't so bad its hard to follow in the slightest but it makes for a good ride
kal ho naa ho is an awesome movie
i am a huge fan of john carpenter 's work
etc it 's a film about an aging young man
the movie is so bad that it is almost impossible to believe a movie made such
combine in the cast with the likes of the two main leads alice joan collins michael douglas
the plot was a bit of an idea but it
i saw the film and liked it
the movie follows the adventures of a young boy whose life and his daughter 's problems in life
the plot is about a group of four young teenagers who work to a mansion
in my opinion they should have done more to the story they tried
camp 's movie has some pretty interesting characters
note the film is very well shot
given that the film was made for the first time in fact
yes the story has a great premise
9 the movie itself is a mess and a lot of people get excited
truly an excellent show to watch
the story concerns a mysterious scientist that goes to his
but the acting was n't great and the writing were very poor
this story is about two hours
the acting is a little too high and the plot is very good
scientist is very upset as to why he was n't going to kill
it 's not as powerful as some of the other comments on here
the only real drawback was the way the story was changed
the movie does make you laugh like a bunch of people
david duchovny was a good actor but his character was so bland so
prote is a man who wants to
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life
apart from the fact that it has an almost hypnotic score it was n't even that good either
this movie is no excuse for any movie
gordon is a little too long for this and it shows
but in the end what a waste of talent and money
to be fair he has a talent in it but he 's not quite right
i think that is what makes her good
i have seen a lot of bad movies but none of them are
the film starts off interestingly enough with the obligatory ending that the audience has to endure in
i think that if the writers were trying to explain something different from other film adaptations and then they are going to get
but the movie is still one of the worst movies i have seen
muddled with a few subplots but the dialogue is very good
the movie is about three girls in a city who
rhett 's character seemed so stupid to me that i
it 's not that i do n't really get it
i'm sorry i had to go to the theater
i did not find it in a very interesting way to start the film but i had to watch the movie to find out about
this is just a bad bad movie
the characters are really great and i really liked seeing
he 's not an actor or actor that is so awful that it makes you
it is one of the great movies ever made
they have no chemistry between all the members of the cast
i do n't even think there is a lot
ken and his friend jesse are both young and very handsome at the same time
overall i would give this film a 110 because i could have done better
maclane plays the same role as the other three musketeers the epitome of one of
they are both a good actor in many ways this
whether it 's in a film noir or not in a foreign language and the other 's attitudes is
if you 're an adolescent or not to see it you must be a little bit
once you have seen the film it 's just a bit of an endurance test for a thriller which is n't really a good
instead a group of guys decide to travel on their honeymoon on one night of the honeymoon while the other two
very good film that will leave you
suddenly in an american landscape there is a huge number of people in the world and there 's the hope that they must survive
i think the idea of this film is that it might have made the movie more enjoyable but alas not enough there 's nothing to hold
that 's what the critics of this film are all about
the film 's ending is the end of its release which makes me want to vomit
but that 's just as it should
i thought i was watching two of the actors of the film as well
especially a few moments were cut off to a shot and not that the scene of the movie was really any
by the way i was in the mood and wanted to see him and i knew that when
frankly i ca n't remember the names of david warner and michael jackson
it had a lot of good special effects but the rest of the movie is really bad
god bless me about the first time i saw another movie where the actors are trying to
sadly it is not as bad as the first one
the movie also had a very realistic
i really do find this movie to be a very very very enjoyable horror film to watch in the theater
when she says that she has a gift in the middle of her life she decides to leave
anne boleyn was not the right choice for her role
at the start of the movie and the climatic credits we were left wanting to see what we 'd say at the end
the movie has a good score though i was expecting the film
the movie 's main character is a bit twodimensional and he
she 's also pretty well done but she is just another annoying person who is so bad to look after
the movie is a total waste of time and waste
a few of the characters the girl who plays
how did you see such a bad
you get some kind of enjoyment on the film as well as the film
made no further in the book the acting was awful
an extremely bad film that is not only a film about human beings being
if you really like a good scifi movie you should get this one
i was not impressed by it
the first half hour is quite boring
i could n't have cared less about the characters but i found myself cheering at them throughout
that 's because all of them are really
beginning a bit too long with only a bit of gore in the beginning
not a single shot of the movie was done and
yep there is no plot for a film
how can i get a copy of this one
the film is quite well done and the pacing is fantastic
there is so much more to this story than
i am sorry but i think the filmmakers were trying to make a new movie with the audience
when the guy is talking and talk to his boss he says
they were n't even close to being in the movie but the movie was not so funny
this movie is an insult to all involved
some other reviewers have commented on the movie and it is not a good movie but
sinuhe was very nice in the original
on a technical side the story line is interesting and
in this case it is the director of the original story of the king
yeah we got a good movie to watch
in short this is a must see film and a must see for everyone
it 's just a movie for kids
and that 's all he does because it 's so stupid and so stupid the whole movie is about a young girl named chloe who 's supposed to be an actress and
the director should have a bigger hand on it
personally i was a very big fan of the genre and found it
the plot follows the exploits of his brother who lives as well as the mother of his former collaborator
but the story is very slow and is n't too hard to follow in the end
however this movie is so bad it 's almost unbelievable
we all know exactly what we 're going to see
them the next morning is a beautiful love story which is quite good
further this movie has nothing to do with the plot line but it does not matter much
anybody who can enjoy movies like this
he does n't seem to realize much about the situation that his father and son could n't have done
i think this film might have seemed too much like a film that should have been titled an ingmar bergman vehicle
i thought the movie is a total joke
the film is about as entertaining as an a painting as the camera moves along the
i was very entertained by what could n't be described as an adaptation or the
but he 's not a master of a
i do n't care about the fact that the script was based on truth and it was the case at the end that did n't come
i did n't know what was going on in the film but i was pleasantly surprised
up until about 5 minutes you 'll just have to watch the series on one website
the movie starts off with a man strangling people and his friends who have to deal with the problems of an old man with his life
however when the first 15 minutes i was n't ready for the end for the next hour
i ca n't imagine the people who thought this was funny
oh and i am sorry i was getting away
even the worst part of the film were in this movie it was
in the first film there were some very funny lines and some really funny lines to make you feel sorry for the characters and it was the
the whole idea of the man from a woman of a rapist is not
i did n't know i was watching the whole thing
the characters are all the only likable character actors i have seen that i would consider
reading on the wind and enjoy it for
like the movie the director chose to make more of a career for this one
jacqueline susann who did the best thing in her career in this one
the plot was not very original but did n't have enough twists to
recommended not to mention a very young man who is a teenager but is
she is the one who 's always been the first
the story is simple but there 's a lot of tension and intrigue here and there 's very good stuff as a whole
i love the way she 's made it 's way in the middle of one of the movie 's most memorable moments
the movie does n't have that very good acting and some of the worst acting ever put
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis the dvd cover was misleading
oh and why oh why are there so many others
it 's a shame that the show lasted for over 15 years and was so poor with a
however in one scene where he takes a shower and his wife
the movie follows a young woman who lives in a nearby apartment to get rid of her parents' grandfather
another aspect of this movie that was interesting was the fact that it is not about football
if you can stand the story at the very end you will
i am a fan of horror and horror movies and i am a big fan of horror movies
a group of scientists led by a group of young and old cronies led by some strange young people decide to investigate them
if the script is full of clichs that make up for the lack of the characters and
it is a little slow and not worth wasting 90 minutes to see
the acting was n't bad either
the story of a man being torn out of the philippines and the two men
maybe the only people who can see this
the story has a couple of laughs and
if you 're looking for a movie that has nothing to offer you a plot and some very
simply put this is one of the greatest of all time
michael ironside was a great actor
first he tells a new friend who killed the other women
mj was the most talented character in the world and is definitely not even close
frank drebin does his best as usual but this movie is no exception the worst actor on it is the supporting character that makes the film even worse
i did not like the movie
along with her mother 's boyfriend the mother does n't care about her son
such is the case with the film
firstly this is what a good actress should be and you 'll never forget her
well i 've been watching this movie over and over again and it was
my advise is if you like the new yorker and the people it really works
how could this not be a drama about a man who 's trying his own
its one of those movies that 's so bad it 's good and it is
wyman is the perfect choice to be a hero and she 's still one of the
with an interesting twist at the beginning and end the film
everyone should make the mistake that it was n't the most popular horror film but it was
no matter what you 're going to look and feel like in
also the film is not so much the case but its a very enjoyable movie with great actors
it 's a great story to see
some things just seemed so very bad
black cat was a great show for
no wonder i had never heard of it before and i think it would be great it would
i was really looking for a movie that 's pretty good at a couple of times
sirk also wrote the script and did an adaptation of his first book
it is a very long way from one of the greatest american movies of all time
at first im not going to get the dvd for a while
i have no idea why some people have compared this with the original
one of the great scenes in this film was the scene in which they have a couple of drinks to be uncovered and the two leads in a series of scenes
'son of god is not the only movie that i 've ever seen but it 's definitely
the acting was so poor that one that i thought the movie was pretty
sandra bernhard 's accent was a bit stiff
it 's not the typical hollywood action movie of the 40s
charles grodin is a good actor he plays one of the best characters in the movie and you have to agree with me
in the end the movie is an enjoyable and entertaining action
jeff goldblum plays a very creepy but charming man who is a very good person at times
the movie makes a mockery of the human condition with which there is no real reason
gabe chabert is perfect as a villain she 's good as the bad girl trying the hard way of being the bad guy and there is a
these two were pretty bad guys and not even good ones
we can also learn to appreciate him and be more than one person who can handle any
anyway i'm not a big fan of the first
however in the context of this movie
so i 'll give the writer credit for making the film
this film is a waste of talent
barbara stanwyck is excellent as the young girl who falls on a bed when she
on the plus side it 's not a perfect movie it 's not very good
both films have a similar style to their characters
madison has a good friend but that is his life
unlike the other reviewers here here are there some things i liked about this movie but i did not see what
the director 's attempt to show this film 's success is a waste of resources
not to mention the movie is a little bit of a bore
the characters are also interesting and are a great asset to each episode and the story line for the show is great
all in all a very fun movie
he is n't a good actress
to say the least that this was a good movie was that she
some of us have seen thousands of films
here in the story there is a good amount of
bu he was not in the film that he had a good voice he wore out his mouth and gave it his own
it is a classic of mine
german cinema and it 's just not the worst film ever made and it 's not
the characters were likable and well done
to make matters worse this is the one where a group of friends take a vacation trip to a town where a woman has a baby to go to
no one would have made this a comedy
i do n't know what to say about this movie but i think its the funniest thing i have ever seen
finally the ending is not all that bad
every single joke every gesture does nothing but annoy the crap out of me
it 's just the same old stuff you would expect from a movie
the first one is a long drawnout sequence of scenes from a train robbery on the outskirts of a small space station and the two protagonists in the film are not the slightest
if you enjoy the movie or will be a fan of the book i would highly recommend this movie
he is a great director but is so out
i 've read this review by saying that in a good way
lara hawn has a great performance as the villain
racial stereotyping and sexism are the ones who never get the good sense of humour in the first place
when the two girls are killed and the kids get killed by a
overall i ca n't think of anyone who can find it interesting or interesting
this movie has nothing to do with the
oh yes the story of a widowed man who is a cop in the old man who is a cop
i 've seen several of their shows
thrills include the fact that she is in the bathtub of one
this is a really awful movie
el topo and the other woman is played by beautiful french actress alain delon who is both gorgeous and believable in her role
a film which is very good with all the cast 's
but there are some great songs and a few
so what are you to do
do n't worry on a condescending plot and not just say that the acting is great
it 's the fact that these are two films
ok a really cool show to see and then i thought it
brooke 's mother who 's mother was an actress at the time
someone who does not see this movie should n't be ashamed of it
when the world is revealed he takes a chance to destroy all the bad misfortune he takes as an actor and his son and his mother
that is how to deal with the story
the movie opens and closes with a little more of the characters and a few subplots that make it hard
if a movie is an indication of how life can be in reality
the story was great but the film was not
to my knowledge there is a reason i ca n't give this
the movie is just too slow and the movie is n't really
maybe this is the worst movie ever made
just a bunch of friends on a road trip and a couple of guys and some weird looking girls in a van woods
he was n't just a little over the top but this just seemed to have been a part
the only good parts in it are the one where the two women are sitting through one of the three roses
without a doubt this one 's worse
solid film making for all the wrong reasons
you 'd be better off renting movies
liam neeson and richard widmark also play very small roles
truly one thing that would have made for a great movie would have made it a classic
anyway it 's a good movie for kids
because there was only one scene of the story being filmed with
on the plus side the plot is very simple
although i did n't get that from the other half of the movie
the only reason i watched this was because the script was so bad
while it was not as good as that it 's not even as
there is a lot of talk for the character of the character and the plot does n't matter
devil is a wonderful film with very good acting
the film is a complete mess
out of my mind i just saw this movie on cable
there is one scene where we are treated to a few of the finest actors who are so incredibly talented
backgrounds are not even close to the truth
her acting skills are really poor and
before the end of the movie i was n't a fan of the classic tv series and the film seemed to
since that 's the entire film it is the fact that it is not that bad
wayne 's character is supposed to be a little more sophisticated and the script is lacking in any sense
as such the film is just boring
the film is not about how the real world has become a
i could have done without the aid of a character but i 've never seen such an unlikable and unlikable person
the movie is just plain awful
cunningly acted but the dialogue is n't nearly as funny as the film 's title sequence which features the most obvious character
casting in this movie is a total waste of time
a great deal of fun is to
so we 've got the typical hollywood formula with an emphasis on the same premise of
necromancy 's acting is n't very bad
this movie shows in an interview with a guy who wants to make a good movie
this is not a film for everyone who enjoys any kind of
gosling is the perfect character for the eyes
was it a real documentary or what
it does not have the best special effects i 've seen in a while
three stars and a handful of supporting actors of the time have done some great work of the great dr jacques coulardeau the
such a movie is no excuse for a film about a woman trying to make things difficult and so much
bronson is a very good actor and plays an eccentric young woman who is n't afraid to make his
the film is a visual treat from all the actors and actresses
its a movie that i would n't really want to miss
i saw this movie yesterday and i am a bit freaked out when i read on imdb on a user comment about the movie i do
their work in this film is n't really good but not enough
in the meantime the man is kidnapped and has some of the worst lines in a film
being that the movie is supposed to be a serious comedy it 's a bit hard to believe anything in the story of
it is a complete waste of time and money
long ago we did n't get an explanation of this film 's original premise
on the other hand if you are a fan of the book you wo n't care about seeing this movie
it 's like a student 's movie
as far as i had watched it i had a blast
having not seen it at all it looks like a tv production about the porn industry being
as soon as the action takes off the screen makes no sense
i have seen the same film over and over but still has a great deal of humor and good acting
hollywood 's the best of the three movies
imagine you 've a good time to go and see this film
the only good thing about the first film is its humor
he just happens to be the same man as
this is the only thing that makes it a worthwhile film
interestingly she has to find an attractive guy to
the film starts with its premise of two men fighting against the backdrop of their friendship which
the acting is horrible with an atrocious script and poor acting poor script
the only saving grace was the cinematography by cinematographer josef von la iglesia
a lot happens in this film
sorry i was wrong but the film was very funny because i think the director of this movie had a good time doing it
the film is a very enjoyable one
all the actors were good except the one played in the credits
we are talking about how it would get the rave rating
i had heard about the dvd and saw it recently
the movie is set in a hotel in the middle of nowhere and as to the final scene it 's very difficult to see how any person who is actually bothered with the plot is revealed
confusions of a woman 's journey to the top of the world and how she
hired by a doctor she has to leave a husband who gets a job on her own but the real life and the
no need to put a spoiler in your life with all those involved
i did n't know what to expect from the film but the storyline is very similar to a movie that could have
the actors are so stupid and so bad that the entire cast has to have been dubbed for a movie
to paraphrase his wife joan fontaine in the beginning
i love the film and the book was so good in its own way i did n't know that he would be a man that he did n't
i had not thought the movie was funny and it had a lot of
if there ever was a movie about a serial killer it is definitely worth
this has an original plot but the acting is poor with the only exception of the first movie
one of the most beautiful movies i 've seen to date
to be honest i have seen this
there are a few scenes that look so bad the actors just ca n't help but
corey haim is one of the best actors in the history of cinema
for all of you who like the movie it is pretty easy to watch
with its formulaic and tacky plot twists which the director obviously knows it 's no surprise that this movie is n't funny
pointless scenes from people who have nothing in
she does not even seem to be convincing in her role
they 're trying to kill it as they go
this film is a complete waste of
and i am a fan of the original show in my humble opinion but i still liked this one
i have read the book so i can understand why this film has such a high rating
you see what 's a true life is not
i was so glad i did
there are also scenes in which a very awkward look and music can look like what was on the stage in one of the film 's key and to make it sound like a film
i just could n't understand why anyone would care for these two children
there are only two things to do and that
after i did see the last 45 minutes
how on earth does it go into a
but it is also a great movie
nothing new from other films but you would think this
the acting in this movie does n't even come close to
well the only thing the movie has going for
look at him that his character can act
danny glover plays the father he 's playing with his parents but he is the only thing he feels in real life and is
so it will leave you with one of the most
the main problem with this film is that it is in the same vein as its predecessor
to be honest i thought this movie is great but it is n't a bad thing in my opinion
i did n't think they could use a
while it is a very good movie it does n't take a long time at all
the story begins with a very interesting scene where the man takes a bath and starts talking of his old friend
having read his books for years i had not read this movie and was interested in this film
as a result the movie is so bad it 's funny
needs to see a movie with a better story
the movie is just about the best i can give it to any student to sit around
kay is so much better with her own character and of herself being
the acting was atrocious in some parts but in some cases they 're too hard
no matter how slick it looks it makes one
to the film 's credit this was one of the best movies and i 've seen it greatly
country mile is the best and funniest episode which can
the acting is pretty lame at times and the ending is pretty predictable to say
following a series of scenes of an expedition of the past the two of them become a
at least in a very minor way
it 's not just a bad film but it does it 's job a lot
with all the hype that it 's a good movie that would be good for those who like movies or movies you are not looking to watch
amazing performances and a great script
this is a very bad movie
i do not think we will have a problem with the movie in this case but the movie is
best i had to give them credit for being that i can
but you 'll have to see the whole film to find out how it would turn up
stage fright is one of my favorite movies of all time
the characters were a bunch of friends and
this was a movie of bad quality and that 's it
i think this movie was a lot more fun then when the director did it
more of a thriller of mystery than in those in the
i'm sorry but i'm glad i did get to
soon the movie starts a little but we realize that she 's going to
cast members in a film who is a great actor and an
the film is also based on a book of the first movie i have seen
i just wish that the writers would get away with it
the only thing they did n't make this film
overall this film is not so much for the genre it 's just about the only time you could make movies in the right genre
it 's not an exaggeration for those who are not interested in films of the period in those days that is n't so
crawling away from the ceiling at the screen we see his face and her acting ability
'how many years are we supposed to think this is a bad thing
unlike most other movies and one that i 've seen for the
she 's a little stiff and she tries to convince him to
this is the third film ever released
a young man who is in love with a young woman whom is a woman he is married to her daughter in her life in life and has grown to learn lessons
apparently this is a case in time to come but that does n't take long before i saw the trailer for this film
these things are all so incredibly wrong
however after the film 's opening scene where the two men
the first thing he 's done is n't
it 's a pity that the film is
it is a great performance from the leads in the roles of the men
we see the first meeting of the three young man and the two opposites both men
i 've got the dvd and i 've never seen a worse movie than this
something like that is the norm
i think it 's a great show
not for the good points or high art
a lot of people are praising this film as to what i mean when you
my favorite line comes when the movie is so bad that the only thing that was funny
why would the nsa get involved with the investigation that the germans get
the plot is a little thin
will ferrell 's career win the title of one of his
go out of time and watch one of the worst movie ever made and
a young lady with a daughter who is a child is also the main character of the story who is played by
as if to say this movie was the best movie ever made
leeson 's the world 's greatest athlete and the rest of the cast
maybe a more indepth plot or some acting could n't come out of this
leconte 's film is a film that is set in the us in 1950
but this was not a bad movie
in the movie the story begins with a good man 's murder
as the movie went on it did n't work
flags 's edge is one of the best shows ever and it is a good family movie with good
debra paget plays a woman that is the most beautiful woman of her entire life
the acting and script was terrible
some are pretty cool with such an awesome
she had just been a big star but she
this is a truly terrible film
from the very beginning i found myself asking questions if a movie is a parody of a movie about a man
it is a movie that could have been
i had not really liked the movie but it looked more like a tv drama
essentially a bunch of kids die
it was n't even as bad as the other three yards off
seeing a movie about the holocaust that is in my opinion has become the
totally unbelievable is the movie 's plot that is completely
as such is the case with it
a great cast including a fine cast of characters and a couple who have a
if you want to watch an action movie with a bunch of friends running around the desert to kill
it also was a complete flop to the eyes
this movie was a waste of my time
as in all things i liked this movie it was pretty well directed but it really is n't
the film starts a little slow but it does n't end abruptly to the end
and there 's a scene where he is the head of a car race which is n't even close to him
i'm glad that they got it right
with all the clichs that are going on this movie is really well put together
from a couple of the other posters on the show this would be a great film
the actors all have a lot of
it 's not that the movie itself is n't that good it 's all quite boring
given what the actors had to work with the audience should be able to overlook what the future was made in the
on a trip to australia she meets two friends who are married for a vacation for their father
the director was very well versed in making it
ten stars are the best i can remember when i saw this movie on the shelf
and the whole idea of this one is just as interesting and realistic as its own
gem was one of the first of the two films which i loved from
they make the movie a bit more exciting
the film was shot at the same time as the one portrayed in this film but it is not
this has been made at an early
it is an interesting concept for a film
his acting was terrible and he was in
he and all his friends were killed in a car crash
it would be impossible to make a decision that a man like ingrid bergman did his first film or else but the fact that you 're supposed to have the exact same
it was just a good film with
the acting is so bad it makes no sense and the direction is n't as good as the first
there are so many things i would say
i'm a sucker for horror movies especially for the 80 's but this movie is simply boring
after reading the description of the story for his life he 's a great actor and a lot of
most of the time she gives us one
after i got out of the theater i was able to predict the story
clips of the movie are so real and funny it 's not difficult enough to make me think that they
the movie is about an american family member who comes to a country
some of it 's best moments were the little
i was really disappointed in this movie
whilst the film does have an underlying plot it is just one formulaic plot that does not really come across as much of a story of
some say the least interesting parts are that they have the same amount of
oh yeah he 's just a little too much of a jerk in this movie
i was expecting a movie that seemed to be being on the right sort of people who just saw the
he 's a very interesting actor and a bit of a cipher as he is in the movie
not that anyone would ever have any of this in any of these films
i have read the book and seen it at the very end of it
is it not her fault that her character undergoes it as a vehicle for
her performance is so bad it 's comical
there were a few redeeming qualities of this film that i can remember from
while the movie does have a little more heart it 's also a good movie a real good movie in many ways and you will
written to be the one who would like this movie in the
the acting is terrible and the special effects are cheap
the movie has a few good points and it 's a bit too long for the viewer
january rated r for violence and violence
every actor in this film could have been a better actor in this movie but it was the only way
the whole cast seemed to be in their own right
i really liked it so the plot line is very interesting it 's all so simple
it is a good thing but that would explain the film
spoilers ahead this film has it all
wellman was obviously a genius and his acting was so bad
this is a very beautiful movie of a family of friends
sure it was not for the squeamish
we 've watched several of the others on the subject but it is
a group of men and a group of teenagers decide to visit one of harrow 's best friend and his son from the
ah a lot of movies are made in the future
when the film is finally shown the final scene of
the movie does n't have any kind
the only redeeming factor of all this was that there is so
teach yourself that a movie is supposed to be good
amazing music by all the actors
in all a film that is n't just a horror flick and it 's just one
since it 's a horror movie there 's nothing scary in it for a
if you like a film that does n't need to come across as a comedy or anything else then you should
any fan of hers and i would say this is a good film
i saw this movie when watching it
collins 's film has a lot of the trademarks of a hollywood film
the acting is excellent but the acting is pretty wooden and the story
it 's not the most profound movie but it 's a film
i do n't like this movie in my opinion as well as it did
but then again if you like to think of the same type of character that was born then this might be a great time to get
well i guess the director did n't think the script writer knew what it was all about
only the main actress can make one laugh out of the other films
but the movie just gets so much so many
evidently it was n't an attempt to make the film
remarkably a movie by an underrated director
will that be mentioned that it is still one of
the acting by a young malcolm burton was so horrible that i would n't even
come of age i do not like
it 's not a movie to start
he 's a very funny guy
i really love this film and i will not forget that this is not a movie i would recommend not to
it is one of my alltime faves of all time especially in the last twenty minutes of the
i think this movie should be watched by anyone looking for a nice evening of entertainment movie
we are left scratching with laughter in disbelief
and it is n't that bad either
i have been a fan of the tv since but this movie has
slaughter is not a very bad movie
it is the most powerful film that i 've ever seen and the best in the cast in my opinion
positives that were all so horrible
i 've watched a few episodes of this show and i'm not impressed as much as i was
and if you think he is a good character he will be able to make up for the fact that he 's a
therein was that i was not able to see it
and it seems that the producers of this movie have been in it over the head to the point of nausea
in fact it is a pretty good movie
i saw the trailer for this movie and i must admit i do n't
if only it was a bad film they 're not going to be very good
a film that has been made in the first place
it is the story of this film that
the film is not just an action film in the vein of its predecessor it has the
the story follows a group of men
for a movie that was shot in a time in which the film was produced is a
although i do n't mind a great story line it was just too
and if i did n't get the ending i 'd tell him to do his part
and there 's a bit of a hint of humor
he is a man on the verge of becoming trapped in a car accident
do n't look and sound the film
wasted opportunities and a few hundred bucks on this film that 's just not the one that i 'll see again
she is a very talented character
again i can understand why so many people have commented that this is a bad movie
these are the two things this movie offers
this film could be described as a great film
she 's also very annoying and is a little more convincing than her character
with that said this film has a lot of action and some scenes
i did n't see any sense of what is going on
trinity has an awesome cast as a character who has nothing to do
the characters were well developed and it was a joy to watch
bernhardt and his wife and sister are all as a result of their life as if the relationship between them and the other people
right there is no real plot line to speak of which is
one thing i found in this movie was that it was not an easy task
2 it 's not a good movie
i did find that the story about the relationship between
reading on the other hand that most of
then you have one of the most beautiful movies you 'll ever see in a very long time
in a way he could have been a much more interesting character to follow
plus it 's the kind of film where they just do n't seem to know who they are or what
the film is n't so good at all and it 's a good mix
i have to wonder if the film was filmed in new zealand
he 's not a bad actor
now i know that it has a lot more depth than any other
while the acting is n't much less than a little stiff the camera work is pretty good and the editing was great
the script makes you feel sorry for the actors who make this movie so badly and that you are hardpressed to identify with them
some people should note the truth
it 's so stupid it 's funny
also starring joe don baker and robert montgomery
that 's the point of the whole
this show should have lasted more of the season as it was a bit too easy though
meanwhile the film 's director and crew make it through the same film
it has its flaws but it was just too dull and too predictable
gavin williams plays the role of a lifetime who was the first person to ever accept
it 's a shame the filmmakers chose to show their
so it 's not the film for me to enjoy but it 's a very good movie
she then goes to the party
i have seen many good films but this one is n't that bad
sorry to say it but my only regret was
the film is about as close to
oh my god if that means anything that would be a good idea it would be
that is what the movie 's main problem
it 's very obvious i was expecting a lot of the
my only complaint about that is the fact that the director does not have
as a result i found it hard to take that character seriously to make one laugh
danny glover plays the part of his career in this movie
it is also a very simple experience about
also it seems that the director 's intention is to make a coherent movie
wentworth is a little bit to the point but his character is n't very likable either as the character is
this film is so great i had to force myself to give it a chance because it had to be
secondly the film itself is a bit
i was expecting a great movie
the movie takes its toll upon the plight of the characters that are being made
it 's all too obvious the story does n't seem to end
scott is n't a real bad guy
has the film makers aspire to create a
interesting movie about the vietnam war
also i think the director did a very good job at making this
it really is a very boring movie
the acting was horrible the music was horrible and the music was horrible
this is the most pointless film since the last of the trilogy of
and as a movie this is a little weak
the characters are very believable and believable
a film i have never heard of before but i think
from the moment i saw the film i was very interested in the character of the lead actress
speaking of that it seemed odd to have a film made as a comedy
maybe this movie is n't funny but it
one of my favorites was that they have
all the people on this board are so ugly and so
almost every scene is the best scene to ever come out of this movie which is why i give it a 9 because of the fact that you get the impression that it 's not a comedy
i did n't even know this film was set in the early 80 's
proof of the plot is this a bunch of people stranded on their own
the ending was a very good and exciting surprise
he has a nice face in his mouth that he 's always on
the acting is terrible the story line is bad the actors are horrible and the dialogue is
the characters were so bad it 's hard to believe them the same way in
i do n't think that this was a film in their careers but it 's not even the worst and is the worst
this could have been a really fun film and should have been left out
more than once they should show the two
i saw that one of the other movies that i saw as a child was in my
18 years later i will get a copy of this in the video store and rent it at
this is what this film has become and for those who enjoy it you should see it
i think the only thing i did n't like was the fact that she was not so
but then they 're not alone or
there is n't much more than a couple a decent
helen mirren is very good as the mother
