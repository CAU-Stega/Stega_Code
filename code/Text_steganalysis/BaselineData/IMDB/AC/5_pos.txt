lyrics have the perfect voice look great
many of the cast are great especially milla yadav 's emma and john hurt though not good
cartoons like those are the same reasons a series on
and while it would have made this movie more entertaining it does get the point across
basically it was n't a movie
i loved the ending which was quite poignant and believable and the story had the entire cast
their main virtue is a way to make the viewer see how to use the word to
imagine something about this guy who 's actually making a movie about the welfare of his career with his family in his career
the movie is shot in the style of a beautiful but beautiful landscape but it has
i did n't expect too much from this movie so i could n't say
the music and special effects are absolutely brilliant
now i have to admit that this
you feel the need to live there life
some of the scenes seem to have to do to the characters which are quite so
they are very good also for a few more
horror flick fans should be scared by the sheer lack of
perhaps they might come to terms with it sometime before the ending and the fact that all the protagonists are not the same
of course if you are not a fan of the book it 's still a good thing
i do n't know but that it is that a good movie for
utter utter tripe a must watch
here it is the final fantasy set that seems tacked on for a reason
also i have n't seen the first film and i had only seen the other films even though it was a little
a group of actors have become the focal star of this film
yes i must have heard of him before the
the cast includes a very interesting performance by david carradine who plays his role as a mentally challenged
i also find some of the things that make it a little too hard to get hold of watching
i love it every time i watch it
angie shields is excellent her acting was fantastic
of these two are the worst part i have seen in recent
being that the movie actually features many of the plot lines of the title and a number of others
a movie that could have been better with the title and the title but they
i was expecting something so far fetched in this movie
i guess the story did n't seem like they were filming
he would n't even have seen that
the best part of this film is the ending of the film
it 's a great mix of comedy and storytelling all of which it 's a pretty unique drama
the characters are engaging and believable to the utmost and that a lot of them are great
so the good and bad movies of all this
fortunately the only flaw with any character is the fact that he feels the need to get into the whole situation
tony todd has the chance to display some very nice comic roles
if you ever know anything about computers being a little over
maybe there was some attempt at a better plot that would have made a
ed harris and his supporting cast turn into a really good bunch of excellent actors
just watch it and go on to a better time in your life
except the title i was thinking that if you can accept the concept of a woman with a child a little kid and
throughout the film i was reminded of several of the more violent films of the last century because of the title of this one and the whole chapter being a bunch of women fighting each other as
now i can get the idea that the only reason to watch this film
the rest of the plot takes place in a house where two girls are killed before
one last line about this movie being that of a friend of mine should stop
sonatine is about the world war ii the war
while a few people from mine who are at the heart of this film might not have
she 's not so good it 's difficult to believe she is n't playing the role of a lifetime
i have this one on dvd 's cd copy now
i 'd rather be staring through a watch than anything like that
i was impressed with the portrayal the first
a few years later she finds a couple of good points on the run
and there 's a lot more of the film that it 's more funny than i expected and in
contrary to the above i 've seen his previous and almost half baked film that is both based on a book by the author of a different man in the same
no wonder i'm not going to mention how the acting here is
they did n't know what to say which was really bad and so
boy meets girl girl boy guy loses girl loses girl girl girl meets girl girl girl girl loses girl
as a longtime musician i have no doubt that the movie has been a little long and if that does
i'm glad i 've finally got to see this film and not only did the
kal penn is n't in it for a long time but the fact he was n't going
joel mccrea who was a great director had a few moments with mr bean but he 's still trying to get one of his films but none of his scenes are a great deal of time
our protagonist is the last man in the moon and when he 's in the same room he is
lovers of bad movies will be disappointed
before the end is it any surprise that they would want this movie to end
you get the impression that we would n't know how
it 's the same way of being shot the way the director of these
if you can even call it that of the original it was n't a good movie
the movie is supposed to build some sort of action but the pacing is boring with lots of pointless twists which are no more ridiculous than usual
for years of the movie 's release of its initial release i viewed it tonight and was curious if you will please
while i agree the same old story is a bit too much of the same thing
if you like your movies like 'the adventures of sherlock street' you can appreciate this movie you 'll want to check it out because you will love it
the most disturbing aspect of this film is how the
ted tries to make a living but the way he goes after them to get a job makes the whole show to
with the title character as a big fat man it 's interesting to hear him tell this is n't
there were a few nice surprises in this film but the final result
or maybe my favorite scenes were the one with a friend on the bus
the movie was a fun romp although with many other points i felt as though i
and a bit of a love story between two very different characters is not
from being a fan of david lynch it 's a shame that this
if you are in the mood for a real scary movie watch a few of the actors that you 'll really see
how can you go to like
i 'd say i 've ever seen them in a cinema and a few other
this movie was made on a very low budget
now who was that old enough
no one is really bad enough to remember to have a bad show
it seems that someone could n't even act at this movie
dug up in jail is another classic example of a
it really shows that people think they 're going to be different from any other
many of that i have n't seen it on tv or dvd release which is a fine thing to view
every time i see the movie i will just get
kinda it seemed to be the norm of their characters
overall it 's a good movie
a must have missed for insomniacs
because of this you ca n't do this
the best thing about this movie was that it showed the beginning that is how people would actually
then a bunch of friends are being stalked by a car
but i do n't like the movie it was the weakest of the bunch and the movie lacks energy
more like a bad acid from the beginning but it is not a complete masterpiece
we 're introduced to these characters and the director and his actors and then to help the movie as the series opens
i had not noticed so much about the show since i had read the book and thought that
one of the worst films i 've ever seen
so you can see things in the right frame of mind but nothing really happens
it was also a fun to see her perform her lines like they were all that is the first one
the plot centers upon a pair of
i'm sure the people at guantanamo bay did n't pay
great acting great acting marvelous directing
we are supposed to find some kind of sense of reality but it becomes increasingly obvious
an entertaining movie that 's all
the whole premise of an alien abduction
for me the best movie to be the last two
he wants to play a new character or just the love
it is one of his best films ever
it is in english and i love it but i cannot say it 's only a bad film
there is not a few scenes where the plot involves a few things are
if the action sequences are n't anything less realistic and effective the second story is pretty predictable
3 this is a great film and worth seeing
it took forever to get the word minimum but it was only soso at
for example it would have been nice to see a more sophisticated picture of a serial killer but the main
i think it is the best movie on television in recent years
after the first film i was able to identify with the characters and the characters but this was n't the only one
in fact you know you are from the same period as in other disney shows and even so do n't watch the
i do n't know why but not enough i can see his performance
give the filmmakers credit for that
if you have n't seen this flick you can see why
the characters of each actors is perfect
i just saw this movie at the sundance film festival and i liked it
bottom line i 'd give the film a chance a 110 on the imdb
the characters in this movie were very different but the way the story was presented is all wrong
most importantly for it 's performance was the performance by john doe who 's just been reduced to the role of a famous
we 've all been used to better describe this one but it
that would give the impression that i would n't like
i had to watch at least once a little over but my brother and i still got a grip on
hardy is a wonderful actor even when he gets to do the same
mark hamill does an excellent job as
i have always had a movie about the plight of the family and
some of the jokes such as it were for some reason the previews on the back cover that they
we learn of the way the two react in the present
but the plot is too basic and unrealistic of the film
do n't misunderstand with the first two in my book the wrong comments but this movie made me angry
john woo made a great effort but it is hard to believe that
i would n't say more of you
this was made at such an early
the characters were all real enough to understand and care about
lovely in color the picture was just very bad
if you want a good thrill ride for the horror genre that has nothing to do with the killer then maybe
i think the real talent behind these films was that he was supposed to
something is n't really a big deal by the end of the movie the whole picture is the main
lots of blood and plenty of blood and
i did n't care for the younger brother because of his sister 's death
other than that the film was horrible
so i watched this movie after watching iti heard the great and the first thing i knew was the great soundtrack
shows a bunch of people dressed together like dirt and having a conversation about everything they can in the process i was
marshall plays the role a little and does it well i can do the same
so there 's some great reason behind this movie
miss marple is a brilliant actress
the movie is a bit slow but i feel that this story was wasted in all their own life
while they were in bed by a few old
this is where the show gets going
there is only one problem it 's that it is n't so much from a plot or character as in
the two guys in the film are the exact same guys here
you want to love this movie
it has a great story and a perfect cast
pitka 's father is very naive and not convincing in any way shape or form
congratulations to the writers for producing it
i know that the movie was just terrible it was n't until the end when i was
oh and there 's also the obligatory sex scene a rape scene featuring
would n't believe him for anything
this movie reminded me of one liners
when i realized that at age 3 for the first 45 minutes was the movie itself for
basically it takes forever to take a lot because the story is just crap
my wife a friend to watch it because i have never walked out of age or gone to bed
the most stupid part of this movie are from the fact that the characters
why is it that when i watch this movie on reruns of my childhood to try and
the dialogue is good but not at all consistent
aside from their efforts to use a certain plot
but the movie is a nice surprise
i do n't know how my life is like this
however the movie is very good and really good overall
in fact in this instance you just have to get to the end of the movie
give the actors a run of all of them just to see how
i'm sorry not saying what i want my parents to be and that 's how i
instead of being the main character his wife is a very talented person who becomes the master
there are a few good lines here and there and the movie is pretty good
all through the movie you are supposed to root for the characters to feel for each other but the film develops very
all in all this is a classic of its own and i will
last the movie is a mess of sorts of the first ever before and with no redeeming factor
a good action film that 's about two guys who get arrested from a murder mystery involving
i have watched this movie countless times and
i could have gotten a little bit of money on this film
after having seen the first three films i can say that i am very glad i do but this one was definitely the cutest
dylan 's character seems somewhat to be the villain of an already troubled serial killer
i was surprised by how bad the acting in this one was but i have nothing to lose
that 's really the only aspect of it that is quite memorable and i think it 's very funny at times
paid from a small budget was not even cheaper than
do we get to think that the man has the power of his own death to die if any of the
and it is quite a shame that such a wonderful series ever has such a shocking affect on our protagonist
i'm surprised that i saw a copy of this movie when i was in prison and
for some reason i was at a theater theatre in which she looked good and this movie
too bad it did n't have a much lower budget then it was
i am so upset that i could not see this film because it was one of the most entertaining moments in
screened in the last 15 minutes by a few and good performances by christopher plummer and joan crawford
i ca n't believe my eyes even if the
perhaps this is the first film ever made i have the patience it has to do with me i have never had another film
the best part of the film for me is to see a great score by robert
in terms of quality i could do a lot better of this film if that
i had to watch a movie where there were three scenes that could n't
wow if you love movies that want to be loved and make fun of and then get what they are trying to see you could enjoy
the plot is quite simple given the ending but by this end things do n't turn out as a matter or even a very good
it 's an amazing movie for me
feel this was a good movie with the actors
my suggestion is to see this film and do not bother to watch it unless you were on either a stage show or a waste of talent
it is a very simple story of a young boy named angus
a friend and his friend who meet in a train raid by
it 's pretty funny for a lowbudget movie and pretty
the movie tells and feel better and more as a matter of pace than usual from the previous entries
so what 's so good about the film the most interesting and accurate
the only reason i watch this film is because it is
thomas and lisa are not as good though but the real star of the movie is the
kikuchi 's direction here is very well
my main problem with the movie is that its lack of budget are not
ah yeah but the worst i 've ever
though the actors are n't the best it has ever worked and the screenplay is awful the acting is awful the special effects are
also of course they seem to like them when they do n't
while on another level it is clear that this is one of the finest movies of all time
mayo 's direction of the movie is very impressive as is the story and the locations
i had to watch it to be very
though the movie was supposed as i do get to see what it meant about the movie and not a story it 's actually entertaining
however the film is the only one that can make it even
were they trying too hard to give us the typical suspects
this film is a complete piece of crap
vincent dunst is a decent actor and a perfect little actor
the script had some good special effects and one with several good actors in it
then the two become the same
it 's just so bad it almost unbearable
if it had been released in 1970 it looks cheap and has a few good laughs but it
well if you are not into the history of the world in which a
ok maybe it will be a bit easier to comprehend but the
this is the first film i 've
if you 're into a zombie subgenre or not of science fiction you want to see this movie
this movie made me laugh a bit and
through the years of watching a film that 's not as good i 'd give
it is a great film that in spite of its shortcomings it is very well
now i did not like the film
fortunately the story is just too stupid and
my son and i could relate to seeing a movie
what was there is that there 's a scene about the movie and the film 's denouement
the music is not bad as it is a song and a rock song contest
they have to be used and there are movies like that
zellweger 's character is very likable and even
clint eastwood and john lithgow are fine actors in
the script has lots of funny twists and turns
for me the worst kind of movie is that it was actually made at some point where i realized in the beginning and the camera pans on to the director
a big screen has to go on and on for a
maid snowblood is not an action hero and a bit of a disappointment
i love the new york 's of the titanic that was filmed
i saw this film on the big screen it came under the impression that it
it 's about a young girl who is caught the grandmother who is her
do not expect more from this one or more than just a little research
the story has been done much too many times
the movie is very slow from start to finish and never lets up until the end
his son is in the movie and it is his obsession with the movie
the film opens with an ad campaign being cut off on a collision between two people which means they are a good party
i love the way we like this film
probably it may help me to get into
absolutely no explanation on the way there were any good ideas for this sorry film
they do all of it well that
it 's so bad it 's fun in every department or the funniest moments of the whole movie
val kilmer has one of the finest roles and that 's exactly why his acting is so
c aubrey smith stars as the man who was trying to locate the evil
she is the perfect villain for the role of a man in the new yorker
barbara stanwyck plays the wife of one of mrs young 's greatest assets
for a few odd scenes he 's not a hero but with the fact that you are not going to go into this
set in the future a huge variety of movies get made for two chapters and this film proves that you ca n't find an obscure movie
once there hinted at their lack of realism this film was absolutely incredible
she 's not the worst actress she had before
the story is somewhat basic though there is
joan blondell is great too and one wonders where the film is going next
this has to be the worst movie ever made
do n't you think there is something to be sure
those who say a little too much would have left up at the film 's
its not the worst movie i have ever seen but you just ca n't get enough to keep myself wasting a minute
good grief is a love story between comedy and action movie
hell i know this was a low budget movie but
we never come to see these characters that i assume are so bad they just
erroll did n't do it again
perhaps they have a more successful director
the movie tells the true story of a young man who is a child
she was the perfect choice the young girl of all the world is the epitome of life
they 're not the only ones this one are so funny
however all and all this movie is a very good movie
goals are always in one of the most successful movies of all time
bbc version is really hard to find
miss kristel a young woman who is
the best part of this movie though is the fact that it took the life of someone who did n't see the other things
goodness is more than what i would call you to the
in the end his character does have a chance to get drunk by her and he has a nervous breakdown
i was expecting a big star from my local family and their
in a way they should have given more to what had been done to the max
he was so young and attractive
this is the second movie that i have seen so many of my favorites have the right to walk into laughter
the first scene of the picture is not funny
he 's not one of them
second a man is arrested from their family and being shot
thats one really thing the film needs
the rest of the movie consists of the bad guys getting shorty and the women
by the end of the film you really would n't care about
you can watch a lot of movies like this one
the plot is a mystery in terms of how
mr blandings was always the great force
the dialogue is n't funny or original it 's just plain stupid
this film is a mustsee for those who are not
the problem is that the film is set in the middle so they do n't get it right
ronnie 's character is a bit stiff he
everyone on the show 's acting really is funny
it 's hard to tell which a
it is quite an achievement to start
the acting is fine and there 's something special with this and i could watch it again to
nick stahl is a comic genius as the movie hero
if you 've read the original i would have recommend that someone has read
there are very few memorable things about
however despite a little bit slow moving and slow moving it still
when i rented this dvd version i came across a copy of this film
it 's not all really that bad but that 's what you 're watching in this movie
these two actors give the film their best and is very likable and
the story begins with the first of the two girls and their love for the older couple
i 've seen a lot of movies in my life and this has to be one of the
all the things we have the recipe for
take this show to a local new level it just wo n't be over to get so good
it is like that it made you cry so hard while watching it
give this one a pass to my friend
however the rest would n't be there
a man and two people are trapped together together and they are killed
it is a long way from that
the movie is like watching an american version of the french film of which the russians are speaking german
unbelievable but this one is very funny
it 's too long for that
the only way it is a real human being is because the director has such fantastic talent that this was a movie that i found intriguing
the whole film has no explanation to speak and there is no sense
when it starts raining it takes over all sorts of people from the different
the movie was a little off of my list and i feel the need to put myself
perhaps it is due to the fact that the film does n't work very well in the film and it will be hard to tell anyone
the ending where a good cop and the hero are both killed and the woman comes close to being the real reason this
oh but they did n't even have a proper sense of
and the scenes between the boy and her brother are so unrealistic that
this was one of those movies that actually had
he has a few problems with it just because of it
it did work a part of life in the early
harry nilsson is a genius on screen for sure
the only drawback is that it 's not going to make any one laugh
like i said i was expecting one to expect at the first 75 minutes of this movie and i
i do agree one person who does n't have any sympathy for all the people who have a sense of
the characters are n't real yet their actions are very good enough and the characters are really good
also notable are the characters and the very very
that 's the point of view all over the place and that 's how i felt
i could n't stand it in the whole film
the characters were shallow but the story
i do n't think i 've tried harder on this film than that in a horror movie as it was so much more than a horror story
mainly its one of those pictures i like and i could not bear it
lament the point to his character was an accident
rhames 's character and her boyfriend are all good because they are so annoying
if you must see a movie that tries to look good it 's nice to
i had seen one of the most ambitious movies i liked the one in which one of the actresses with this one was the ones in the movie
writerdirector tom berenger has worked hard to make another comedy
over the course of a time there was one scene where the killer goes down in a bar to retrieve a pair of hostages
there 's a small problem with the production company and
there 's the usual plot summary which is a lot of fun
the first ten episodes though have n't really been much different
anyway i did n't find it funny
i have heard several about the people who liked it but i could n't help but notice that it was a movie in every way the
though i think it 's a great movie it 's not a good
why did he always work so hard in the
it had so much promise as to be very enjoyable
also the cast members to whom you could care less
a good idea though is a movie that is supposed to be an
the whole plot was pretty poor
90 years ago i have never seen a movie that has the guts to be a good thing with a story that is good
try hard to stay awake for a long time
as the film progressed we learn to feel helpless and care about things and even when there 's an unusual amount of explanation to the character we care about his character
thus we have the idea what happened the first time round to a movie about the killer carriage that was a bit in a
faye dunaway in one of her best roles has the ability to turn away from this movie
also i really enjoyed the whole movie
ms moore should have been nominated for this film
it 's obvious that this would 've had some legitimacy as if they were making a movie about a
snoopy is a bad actor he 's not even bad that the majority of the supporting cast are wasted with the exception of john carradine and george
other than that the movie was well directed and acted and could have been a lot too much
she makes the film even cooler
similarly the film is a bit of a stretch of a true to life but
okay maybe one day a movie would get the oscar nomination for best screenplay and its cast
this is one of the best films i have ever seen and a complete tribute
just think about why the two heroes are the way they 're in the first
at first it never feels like a drama or a horror film or a drama
even though a bit of the violence would be an improvement in the beginning we might forgive any of the cast with regard to such a character
the problem with the original film is that when
and a man with a brain is a guy 's girlfriend
there seems to be little or no interest in the audience
pfeiffer is a good actress and as a result in her small role she seems to be
while a lot of the film 's plot involves little children in africa to find the girl she ca n't speak to
despite the poor direction she did n't have the skills to do the first half in it and i found that the acting was very poor
in fact she 's not a single mother at all the same is not enough to watch this show
then one scene begins from him another one in his early words
then it all takes place and it looks like a bad zombie flick
there are other problems with this film which it 's not
another thing that is really annoying about is that this movie is not the sort of film that you ca n't watch
movie is worth mentioning that a movie is made with some people involved in the cast and it
a man who has to pay no attention for the life 's end of his life who
the film tries to be suspenseful and it is so much so that the film is just unwatchable
the film could have used a better ending
the story is about two young people who live in england in the late 70 's in the late 1960s
in conclusion this is one of the worst movies i have ever
bill nighy makes a movie worth mentioning
chaney 's character is so obnoxious
why was this film made by a wide margin
both of them in the movie are just as believable if not less
cotter is always a great example of what is he in the end
the ending was a bit of a downer
director stuart nelson is also good at it but his talent is to make the movie feel as
the movie opens with a very long monologue
another thing is i wonder why i did n't watch the movie till i discovered the preview it was just
a film that just did n't get me at the video of it
now if you are one of those guys who want to see anything
the movie is very good at points and is worth watching for those who enjoy watching it with its replay
but this movie is n't a good movie it 's worse than the best movie
i saw this movie with the hope that it
as for how it comes in the late 80s he goes on and has fun as the embodiment between sex on the sexual side
i thought it was ok since i saw the movie
the plot is full of holes and continuity the script is dull
the movie also has a couple of good laughs
why did the killer 's mother get a huge and
her husband and brother were murdered by two sisters and
at first they were not funny
so there is a scene with the main character that he is forced to walk away from the
when a movie like this could have been made it might
anyway i know that this is an extremely accurate movie but i'm afraid that
all this leads to a startling look at the nature of love
well do n't worry this movie
kathy bates is the reason the movie is so great
my sister was a bit traumatized because i liked a few minutes of her
another classic about an italian village
she goes to town and finds it
it makes a point to how good they are
i was n't impressed with the movie
i guess this is one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen
the two young women get together and each other and they go into various other lives or meet each other
consider it a comedy for kids to learn from its own and be very stupid and ignorant by adults who just want
includes that she 's not a woman
he is n't a bad guy or two of
either way you 're so out there that you know
i think he is a very capable person so he has to use a method of talent that is
as i stated it does not take itself seriously
all in all for a long ride to the old adage they 'll never really go into their roles
we never see the original it will be better and not it is
yes the plot is very original and
and it 's not quite clear whether to be
last week i watched a lot of movies made in 1982
well now i will get an idea of how it 's all done
i loved the scene when he was making
it 's a real shame because some of the actors were so bad i wondered why they put into the story so many people in the movie
one of my personal favorites for that i loved the other a very funny story line and some brilliant acting
in other words you 'll be disappointed
the movie is as bad as i expected it to be
but the plot of what she has to go through
not to mention a lot of the songs to this movie
basically it 's a film that 's full of suspense and the performances are fine especially the two leading ladies
pity i would not want to watch
this film was just plain hilarious if you want a real laugh
now there is another aspect of this that makes that much sense if you are a
do n't be taken this out by the director
now who has a heart warming sense of guilt
the story is too complicated for most parts with a lot of plot holes and gaps in that
this show made me forget the most of them because
what kind of a great idea that this movie is
it was a real treat but not really enough and was n't for the faint of heart
2 the girl is one of the most gorgeous i have
the movie was so bad that it would actually be an insult to a movie that is not bad but only a select point
oddly enough the film does n't try to focus on action itself in any way and it fails miserably
each of a sudden has some minor issues in mind the ending of the film is just too long and the ending is a mess
the film 's narrative is the same and as in most of the key stories you can watch it without resorting to anything more
weber 's character was so onedimensional that it could n't be a good idea for someone to be offended by the lack of real logic
the whole movie was an attempt to recreate the film noir genre that was released in 1978 when the
cohesiveness is not the most important thing about it
this is a good idea a good one in the genre
leon tries to keep his tongue out of the blue and get himself to be the
we get to see the real woman die she and the daughter are in love
either way it could have made the whole thing more difficult to follow if there was actually some really scary movie to be a great horror movie
i do agree with the other reviewers who gave this piece of crap a rating of 1 because we had nothing more than

but the rest of the cast is either that of a bad man or an actor but for the
just do n't waste your time
the story has great special effects and sets but by far the most convincing and most enjoyable
the script is good also as is a good scene in the original series
the film tells the story of how all people have to be the first film in the world
the movie just goes out of my way to get the plot in a ridiculous way and in the end it

john krasinski is a real winner
it 's like someone 's got another idea

that is why the film is in the same
anyway the story line sucks and i think that 's a mistake to bring back
i found a movie that i could n't forget about but this one is so much better
lucky to say that it 's one of those movies where you have to see it
at some points the film turns to us as a comedy it just goes nowhere

this is a good movie for those who wish to see a better gangster
everybody 's pretty stupid and boring
the actors are excellent and the story is a real lesson
first of all the music sucks the whole film is just plain stupid
it looks very cheap and poorly written
the fact that this film was released is such a shame
although its fun to hear it that is the kind of film i 'd love to see more
in other words when you are a fan of the film this

spoiler spoilers warning i loved the episode
i loved the little edie on the cover and in the end and there she comes with him

it is a nice touch on every one of these categories
the plot is fairly simple in places but even the execution the film is n't really a good film either

i was not impressed to see that the film
he 's the star for this
the first 30 minutes of the film are really nice
and when the end to the end of the credits this movie is a lot more fun than expected
it seems that the director has done a serious job of releasing the original film and even that was
which is why his portrayal of a man 's life has ended in a little long but he has some nice qualities as well
the characters are flat and unlikeable and the acting the worse but overall you are n't a good looking person
on this one it makes me wonder why it was

and then there are the performances that are far more complex and the characters are believable to anyone with their feelings of

it 's just a bit bit dull for me
hoffman the man who gave to the doctor in an automobile accident takes him away from his office and tells him about it

it is almost as if the film has a little too many to offer
i could n't get into it because it sounded like it had a lot

i think it 's supposed to be funny but in this
i would only recommend this film to you

the movie opens with a very strong and very moving moment
chabrol plays the main character in a movie
any other movie in my lifetime is a delight to make a good movie

painfully bad acting and terrible production values
i was just hoping there might be a sequel
he had also been in a coma with the people and was so stupid that he had become an outlaw
my father and i could see this movie over the years
the story is set in the south of december and it takes the film to find a way of conveying the cultural aspects of the
if the film really makes you understand its message why do people feel it 's just stupid
pure unadulterated boredom does not always fall short
being one of the first of 10 i 've just a little of the old black and white photography but it 's like it was shot
that 's about all the film is good and good fun
while i did n't agree with me at all other times it was very realistic
not a great example of the genre and its a waste of time
heist on the other hand is a very

there are many moments of extreme brutality including the first one but the film is filled
they are still the most beautiful actors in the film
my daughter and i rented the video
the performances are horrible the story is awful and the jokes are lame
it was almost as though the screenwriters were trying to convey the character dynamics and they made some points out of a good deal of work
this movie is more like a remake of

i love that the movie has its flaws in order to make a bit of

while this is one of the most boring movies it has the best performance on all the screen time it is very well worth watching
would not be a classic if it
he 's an interesting character and is not afraid to take over the law
so the story is n't that of a thriller as with the characters but instead
there 's nothing to recommend about this one

certain other things are i guess she is a very nice guy but they are unable to tell her
matt dillon makes one of my favorite villain 's villains and they
zimmer 's films are so visually stunning the film is quite beautifully crafted
the only redeeming quality of this film is streep which i found
it does n't give up too much
the movie itself should be more and more realistic in the history of science fiction and the people that went through it on the project it should be in the theatres for free
we get an improvement into the real world and how to get back into the future
the story is good and the acting is good and what
just because it 's a sequel to a comedy is a definite loss
we 're so stupid that they make it hard hitting for us to believe people
this one is no longer fun and worth the time of your life
3 the only funny thing is that you have to get some extra laughs to get a laugh just like i really did
i can only guess his real intentions are that he ca n't act and the rest is pretty funny
the story begins a little slowly loses interest
the ending is too obvious but i was looking forward to checking the movie out
i do n't think movies get a fair rating but do n't worry that the filmmakers never even thought the title in real life
i know nothing about the character of david carradine he was the villain of course because
the acting by the actors is great and the characters work very much

it 's just an excuse for the audience to suspend
why would karen and a young woman find him in the arms of her husband
if someone who has a chance to watch it would probably agree
ok maybe i thought the whole thing was just crap
they do n't make a sequel and they do n't really have to
and then another is a movie with a lot of action
the character 's are played by the actors the actresses who are not given the chance to portray the whole movie well
then they decide to take her up
and i was left confused about the whole mess
i'm gonna write in my comment and
it 's the kind of thing you have to do n't even
thats all you have to do is watch movies
david warner 's movies are the best of them all
cultural satire has never been done a film of the same magnitude
to be honest i could not say anything about the story but i did n't enjoy the plot that this is supposed to just be
every once in a while it is funny
the only thing i have heard about this movie is that all
not all the characters are believable
maris is about to take on a beat the old man who lives in a small farmhouse who is a hero and a businessman
at the time to be a part of the story the viewer was able to relate
but after i had to read the other reviews on the movie i watched it to appreciate how it would have to be to get people to say
however the first half was so weak with its characters that it became even more painful to watch
the whole movie revolves around the idea that the only person who thinks

the only good performances were those involved

maybe even the most important and forgiven i do n't know and even i could use to try to convince
i could go on and on about movies that
amitabh bachchan is in a film at the end
this film made me cry and should be the perfect complement for the film to be written
my advice this might be one of those films
this is not only because they have
but this movie also has quite minor problems in terms of
well this was the first that i 've
hope davis never made another character
that 's the only reason this movie was
now i'm gonna get my vote down with this one and make a brief appearance
this is a good movie very good film
the first story is about a group of
i ca n't really go to the plot to get the story down
another thing i hated about this movie is its lack of originality
the only person in which i could see
i love movies and films and i love the first
i have n't seen him in anything i
at least that 's an interesting thing in this movie
it makes it difficult to identify with any of the characters and the dialog is also so good in the end a story is actually pretty good
this is a great movie that shows the struggles of those in the first place
you cannot believe that you ca n't use a real talent which
the only problem with the film is the idea that these two movies have the potential to be released in the form of the original

all the other reviews on this monstrosity had me angry
this was an excellent show but the series 's overall quality is still great
nothing 's seen here and it certainly shows
it 's the funniest and funniest scene ever filmed with the music score by philippe stevens
the acting of everyone associated with that character are completely unconvincing and the director has to deal with other issues to be used in the film
or the next scene in the movie where the main character says that
if you are looking for a movie that will appeal or something that will appeal to those who have
the most remarkable thing is that it has no story and has one of the strongest casts in what it is is a great

i guess we are all now in our world but this has to be one of the most horrible

the film seems a bit rushed here but it 's more interesting and more believable
in fact the director would n't have been able to tell his story
jacknife also gets its fair share at the start and never lets up a few
but it is also about people who love their victims and are all driven to live
it is such an odd story and the performances are fantastic
as for the plot it 's too simple and too unbelievable to be funny and even with the help of bad acting
what the film lacks was the great
dassin has tried in the film to be as serious witty and meaningful as the hacks as they both have to
this one is really just another show
dare you ask yourself anything to ask what a film should have been

d'artagnan the heretic is the best and it 's a shame that i
the only good thing i can say about this film is that its not even funny enough but it definitely is n't the worst movie of the series
the only film of this would be a much worse effort is the scene that is supposed to be taken seriously
one of my favorite parts was when we got to see a girl fall in
allegedly it has two characters who are more to be seen in the movie as they look different to them in the future
however this is an original story

remarkably bad is that the movie is a complete waste of time

this is a bad movie but at least some pretty good and funny stunts
it 's a movie full of bad acting stupid actors and horrible writing
the ending is an instant classic
the movie does a good job of portraying young characters which
i was never surprised i did but this movie
i am not very sure what to expect
he also wrote some of the best and most of the best animated books ever to come as he was in the last twenty years
her character is one of the most interesting things about this film and that
it is the kind of film you can sit at your own with an hour to be able to see
it 's hard to tell how much work this movie is the main reason why
certainly its not fair for the writer to have
even the actors in my old pal would 've thought to make a good movie for me
overall it is a very enjoyable experience that i can only rate
can i have the soundtrack the songs the music
all in all this is an enjoyable movie
everybody in the theater is a stereotype i cant understand how bad it is but
a movie which would probably be a flop to those who can make an independent film and
noone is really as good as the ones playing in
the whole family is a bunch of friends who get around with each other when they get to know
after viewing the film i was curious about it it was very slow
there are some great scenes i am pleased to be with those who find it offensive and if you 're not a fan of the book this is a waste of
the story was good though the actors were n't very good and
those two are very poor together
eventually they realize that their husbands have the possibility of getting a bunch of drugs of their own which
being a fan of the first film i thought there might be some interesting moments when was the one thing was the plot of
and that 's a shame you did
at least he and his pals find themselves in an ordinary place and the other two boys decide to take them off of their lives and find
i had been searching for all three to the film but did n't understand this one
this movie is really a real treat
he was very creepy so obviously a bit of a brat but with little imagination and that 's probably
however the main character is so bad he has to resort to physical
this movie also made it to the
i am not a big fan of musicals but when i 've got it or not
this movie is a waste of time
it 's a little like a good movie with lots of laughs lots of action and one liners
it just gets me to sleep with the characters and all the other people get bored or
i watched this movie tonight in my laptop for days
the most annoying scene comes when they try to make it hard to tell who they are
there is no way this story can be developed by a character or a plot or character development as it progresses
the acting in this film was great a must see for all lovers
both films are funny and do not have any good ideas
yes this movie is great but if you see a comedy like a lot of it in a small town in the philippines no matter how hard you try something that you ca n't do
having said some of it they are not all that bad
some of the worst acting and listless dialogue in a movie is one of the most stupid ever to emerge
i loved the ending of the movie where it has been the
put together the characters with the exception
1 12 stars on the whole thing
i think this is one of the worst shows i 've ever seen
the whole thing has a little girl running around for a very odd
it is not the most original movie i saw it to be this i will always remember
i thought i was looking for something that the characters would like
however if you can get past this film that you are
izo has been my personal favourite and the movie itself is to be
i have nothing against the wall of the movie that is supposed to be funny but the story line and the
cypher has been done so many times in its time and of the longest moments of the film have been seen
then i had i rented a movie entitled a week earlier when i
it was a good way to spend a couple of hours but to be entertained i
after all if you are trying to analyze a film like this that 's a great idea of the matter
i 'd also recommend watching the series and get a feel
this film has it all and should have been a part
the film is n't just a comedy but a comedy and a serious one at that
please i implore you to have to pay
at the end of the movie at the last minute they are in
let me explain the importance of life the film portrays it 's not just a film
carlos is a bad guy and he tries to get
but she 's still in one room and does
naturally the film is the strongest of the four
what do you do with this film
some of the most ridiculous lines occur to you
everybody was just starting screaming at one scene
other than that there is a lot to like here
it was good seeing it on cable recently and you would watch it
the fact that we are the weakest of the
the actors deliver lines that i never heard of again
watch out for the little parts which should have
the first two entries were good and had some interesting performances from the cast
my favorite character was the hero that did in fact
it 's a long way of thinking it was a good idea to work on a film called that film or a documentary
nothing that actually happened with the whole thing was just
despite the fact that the real threat between both men the women would n't have the upper middle school sweetheart had to have some good qualities from
this film was a treat that should be avoided viewing
it seemed as if this was the end of a bad part of the plot as the movie went on to an abrupt script but after
tom and jerry 's bogus film had me interested in all things
and what do they get out of the car
but in the end there is nothing to spoil it
anyway he 's got some good and moving moments to it
the acting has all the requirements of a good and entertaining movie there is not much
at least the movie is full of interesting twists and turns
i had to turn it off because i was bored
he 's just a very nice dude with a talent
i ca n't remember how this movie came to be for
for my taste it is probably because this movie is so bad if you
why the hell is that the movie makers had it listed
songs were pretty poor as the main theme song was in my hometown
my only complaint with this movie was some minor spoilers here
now i'm sure that the reason why the movie should do is is that it has absolutely no redeeming features or special effects i 've seen it done in a million times but it 's pretty much a masterpiece of storytelling so we see a bit of it in our hero
the film also features a lot of gore from the beginning the movie takes place
if you are looking for a movie that explores the themes of bigotry in human
the two main characters seem to do their best to survive with them and
it 's like she 's in the movie
willingly the viewer is treated by the protagonist
or was it his own one dimensional
yet with the success of its low budget i would choose to avoid
for reasons we see as the same as the rest of the movie
i saw many episodes of this movie and thought that it was just another version i loved the
perhaps it is worth a watch
this show really needed to be
and even worse we are left with a big bad swim
i mean i can hardly watch it
in fact when the film opens in the most shocking scene we learn the story of the man that has lived it from the very beginning of the film that he
i have been in a state of shock and laughing and i will even
yes they make amends and do not want to go to the bathroom
one day she has a onenight stand and starts to make a big recovery when she
hoffman as the psychotic scientist a lawyer who is unable to protect
his performance in both the original and the english was superb and
as a horror film this must be a pretty good
unfortunately the same goes for it
troy is a very nice young guy with a lot more issues
for a film that 's supposed to be set in ireland
kai is very different from their usual teenage daughter who is
the plot and acting was decent but the story is worse and the movie just plain silly
strictly an experience of the first of the first two films that 's been shown a year to day before
we never see a werewolf in an animal again
much has been said that all in the same sentence
a very powerful movie to watch
he does his job as a tough guy who is an american who works for the government but the government and his cronies in law
this movie is the best example of why so many people were in my car as
this is a great horror film and a worthy example of what this film means about to be a good movie
still it 's an excellent watch and is one
i 've seen a lot of movies and i have
this is n't just a simple film it 's a complete waste of time
about as convincing as the rest of his movies
to have a few things to say about the
i have n't met the writer of either so my advice would be to compare this to some other films
it would have been impossible for me to have had the opportunity
but i have to say that it was a poor substitute for tv
one day a woman finds a new job on the radio and takes the family hostage and her friends to return to prison
director sam raimi has his eye on
the plot is about a very wealthy woman falling in love with her who happens to be the story of a
cut up from the film the first two minutes in the film i can tell the screenwriter 's motivation
she looks more beautiful than that of her usual white
in the end i was able to suspend disbelief by it
but i do think that the best parts of the film were the introduction scene for the character to take a beating
this is a real shame because it is the only story
i was surprised because the actors are all so bad they could do very little to pull this together
go see it if you have n't got
girl gets raped by an alligator and then goes
nelson 's character is a complex likable but loyal young man
i did n't see a single shot that was so horrible that one would look like they would 've made a decent zombie film
the main storyline is a mess that has some twists but it is
his performance is so poor in this movie that you ca n't help but smile
one of the better movies i have ever seen
i also think the film deserves to have been canceled
it looks great and the scenes are so beautifully done
overall the movie is a perfect example of why a film should be
for me one of my favorite shows is the scene where it is broadcast in my
against its success to have a small budget to help it create a film that is n't a complete loss to
madness and a dream not worth the time as if we 're just thankful for an attractive hero in this mess it 's an
i would rather write a scathing review of the original version
smothered as a fan of the first film in that it was more about the real people but the fact that this is supposed to happen after a few minutes a long drawnout and tedious final outcome is done without a hint
my grade f eye candy extras pat and minnie 's topless
that 's why this film is so funny
all of this is supposed to be a part of a family relationship as far as horror goes
this movie is the only explanation that any sane person can be asked for that
the other guy was a lot of fun to watch
this was one of the few things that annoyed me
any major character could be more of a character study than a villain
they both have a huge variety of stories with the main characters in the family relationships and
stylish and engaging is an impressive film by a few years previously that
i think i can forgive it as one of the most pathetic movies i 've ever seen
that 's the first of them
it is one of my favorite shows on video and not because that show
this is n't the one and only saving
but if you like this genre you will find yourself being entertained by the end you 've almost
the movie is full of cliches because of its unintentional humor a few scenes where the kids and the kids get
the dialogue in the first movie is horrible
with the introduction of the late judith reed 's character 's presence this film still had something you would watch or would not be
it was probably just a bunch of random old people who just go straight to video
i mean its really sad and so bad i almost laughed
so we have not done so often
an excellent film for the entire movie
it 's worth noting that the original was the only film about a girl with a gift on her hands and for a while she 's the guy who killed the girl
what 's more i felt that i was
i know it 's a great movie but after that one another
as the two of them become stranded themselves in the woods they find
and while that does n't seem to be the
the only other aspect of this movie that i found
it would be much easier to say more about this
but if they were not so good they would be able to get their hands on each character like they should never let themselves back together
norton and his girlfriend are married together for two hours but also
instead it is obvious that the character is being tossed into a movie or a piece of dialogue
do n't waste your time watching this film it is an enjoyable experience to watch
the only thing this film did n't do was
as i watched the film you feel as though i got something
spoiler i was n't expecting much to spoil the movie the most being that it was
the only thing missing the acting and this movie is so cheesy that it is really enjoyable
it was a pleasure that kept me watching
i saw this movie a few months ago
he can hardly be any worse
i have seen the movies several times and is absolutely entertained
even though they made you think of it as the only one i can
i have yet to figure out something to avoid it from a remake
when they were young they were both and i was bored when
what i really remember was how much
in the original film the story has a very creepy atmosphere of the plot
if you ca n't get past that fact then your kids are probably not
the ending is what little to no one can be expected
the other characters are either so overthetop or so obnoxious they become annoying and the script is ridiculous
the whole thing is a mess from the real start
now in conclusion i do n't even know that i'm commenting on him for his own sake in the future
unfortunately she was a complete jerk
weird thing is he was the perfect
mr moto was a bad movie though this did n't make the mistake that he was n't and he could be the man the most amazing
in the end there is a great deal of violence and violence throughout
i really enjoyed it and am giving it the thumbs up
macy is a very clever actor who
the film really did n't do a damn enough
the script is good and the direction is good
my daughter is a marine so i could identify with all
filmed by a few of the young actors you have a feeling that the actors or actresses were involved in the project
i could have taken a little more interest in the lives of the actors and crew and the viewer
nagesh kukunoor was a great film maker
virginia bernhard was a nice choice for
the actors playing are like the ones in who played a character on the streets from
check this one out but just watch it
i had never heard of this movie as i was watching the mst3k version of the first one
based at the same name and a story it has some minor flaws such as that of its title character
most films that have a sense of humor andor humor were put into a few words
phoebe has always been a movie star but she has no real reason for being a performer and she also lacks that ability
there 's another scene near the hotel scene in which
the story is about two couples who are sent to a hotel together to
had they been married i could see all the other actors in it
sadly the film 's biggest problem with is that this film was made in the 1930 's and 90 's
not much of an impression of the story
the best in all the movies you 're ever seen has a purpose is that all
the acting is pretty good with the exception of this series a decent performance by the actor who played the dad who was born to die
all i saw was something very original and very exciting but that is what it really was
apart from that the movie is very amateurish
in the end you feel like you are seeing
this film was n't so bad but just does not go
the film starts out quite nice with a very funny spoof of a few laughs
none of the actors could have done better
appropriately it 's an odd one as it is not a musical
now what i was wrong was the first two
oh and if you do n't see the first one you should not know exactly what i am a fan
the film is a bit of an allout
the acting is terrible the actors are worse the acting is bad
watch i would say i hated them a lot much
for my consideration i ca n't recall the last time i
shes an honest and tolerant portrayal of love and
a man who is n't a cop his daughter is going to marry a
dialogs are very slow and the actors are n't in their right mind
however this one falls well short of a movie with no redeeming features
there is the possibility to go to a doctor for him the love relationship between the two men is also
the most important thing about this movie is the music
bitter intentions from the audience to ponder all those words
it 's all about time travel and the fact that all involved in this film has to be the best and most substantial
the acting ranges from bad to awful
there is no need of this kind of humor to show us
it is an entertaining movie with a good soundtrack
it 's an amazing film and that alone is a film that makes me sad
it seemed a lot of fun and the cast has a lot of fun
this is the first disney movie that has been produced by the same creator
mighty cercle fat and the rock band of rock songs
this is n't what they should just consider
a film which i find myself watching and watch
modern audiences seem to have an indepth view of life in our community but this is definitely a movie which will stay for the mind in those days
the film feels the same way a cheap and
the dialogue is so bad the acting just plain bad
if so it 'll be your average lifetime fest for you
and we get that guy who just does n't care what he thinks or care for him because he ca n't really deal with his son who
except that the character is just in the movie too old to be his wife
rather than trying to emulate his own work in the seventies and of him what a
i 've seen a few movies that have been shot in the 70
sex scenes are a great touch of the genre
but to me it seemed that the filmmakers were getting
castellari has managed to create a film that could be made at
was it really necessary to leave a lot of clues with a
juan depardieu is so good he 's in the right frame of an action hero
at the end if you 're not acquainted with the characters you should not
my god what a shame that this film is such a waste of time
for me it is a true classic of its own
if you are to be offended by these types of movies watch the first two and
i do not know if i'm referring to the story but i think one would ask the
this is very much a rip off of his work on the big screen
larry 's evaluation of the film is not very bad
he then returns home from the dead
later there 's a bit of violence that is n't really quite violent enough and quite frankly a lot
all the characters are in the movie
the only thing that really lets the story survive is that there is a little
simply put they are not really as
i think it will blow the viewer away from this movie
although this is n't at all a great film it 's just an
it 's so sad that most of the people involved seem to be too embarrassed to understand the outcome of the movie
she is beautiful and makes the audience feel for the other characters
despite the terrible acting and terrible acting it still brings the story to life
the plot is great and the acting is decent
it did show an array of emotions ranging from the original the
here 's a great story line to make you go get ahead of a family for a
i liked the movie it did n't
also that is no longer the way he acts which is the best thing
it 's a nice touch for kids
i do n't know whether this is the last of her or their work to watch another but the rest of this
he should have used his signature style as a character
this is the finest movie i have ever seen
the movie also features a bit of blood and
there are two main problems it 's the worst movie
all these great performances from the supporting actors especially the young couple is an
yes it 's supposed to be a
if only we were n't all that like that
a few minutes of the movie i watched in the theater where i did n't watch the
i did n't see the whole movie as a result of the book itself
guest stars are well cast as well but the plot lacks any believability
but this is how i feel for the actors
consider the ending of the movie and you 'll only have to sit through the rest of the movie
but there also were no small ideas to be explored at a movie
if you just want to make a movie about this movie you must have a soft spot for it
and there are several good movies about them
the result is that it does n't always look like they 're enjoying it
it was not until the very end that all the
obviously this movie was made in the first place in the first five minutes why did the police
but there are some really bad parts
by the end you can have a great family with the family
3 how do you feel like a movie where you wish that they
what a terrible insult to the director
it was the same as the other 2 but the movie was pretty poor
this documentary is an insult to me
but in a short of the movie she is completely
laurel and hardy should know better than this one
lewis' acting is terrible but the rest is pretty much worthless
woman and mother do their best to make her way better but as
russ tamblyn is great as the young man who has inherited his life but
i think it was a mistake in this movie how he
while she is clearly more convincing than this
this was very funny at times and all of that
the whole story is a complete waste of time to any film lovers
sam elliott plays a very likable cop named jimmy
dirty harry is a genius in this very simple thriller of sorts and in the context of the story
although his father 's daughter was raised by his own mother he was asked to be killed
its all about just enough to make your brain cells
it was almost like a good cartoon or is it
they could not decide if he wanted to or just simply could n't
is the story trying to make something more complex
a guy who is a rapper or his own boss and
johnny yuma was a good person but
which is a shame because the plot is
it 's not the sort of performance that is funny
perhaps this could be the last film 's worst job to make any of
this was the worst film i have ever seen
overall it was a great movie in the sense that it made the
no one will know that the real meaning of this film is that it has so many problems the characters do n't seem to struggle
we all know it could n't be this bad but the first is the acting
to this day i still recommend watching the series
norman bates has a strong but somewhat downtoearth style
the director has only done something different
that is a very odd question who is to blame him for that
wayne has the ability to make an interesting appearance but he makes
and that is all the good in the movie
i know he knows what she really wants to be but instead of trying again to help
the most frightening part of this movie is when the guy just is having
this movie had so many plot holes i thought there was a lot of money
like the story has a bit of going down the road with an intriguing cast and cast
many of the performances of a film are simply fine and the scenes are quite interesting
actually a must see for all who love the original
it was the stupidest movie in the 90 's and a dozen
i just finished watching the movie
compared to the tv series it would look more entertaining and entertaining at the same time
the whole movie revolves around the bad guy 's evil antics
please do yourself a favor and get
so there a few moments in which an analogy
if you like the idea of the great russian war this
it was so bad it was good
for no one reason they must have done a decent job
i 've seen the movies i 've read that i would have found to be very
possibly the reason why the story has so many holes is that the screenplay had been done so poorly and had some very weak ideas the acting failed miserably
when they have them and they all become entangled in the system where they are given a large chance of life that the movie takes a turn in the lives of both couples
so you would n't have this a story of two sisters and a third child in a room where they are being attacked by a group
should never be a classic movie
to be honest i was surprised when this movie started it was quite
she never even makes a movie about
i would say the movie was shot under some kind of location where this is the key to a book
i really liked the music score and the lighting work
i just felt like the movie was just awful
you never know why he was there
one should only view one word of opinion in this movie a few times
the result does have a similar theme for the film
gray is a man in a hurry to be able to capture his love with others like the way he addresses them
but it makes you think the story goes about
after a while they have no redeeming qualities or talent they are obviously there somewhere
and the end result is something different
all i remember on the site seemed to be the one in the movie for example the movie i felt to be at the top of my head
robocop iv is a disgrace to the genius of its predecessor such as star
of course the film starts with a great premise by using an intriguing idea to illustrate
the story is told only by using flashbacks or
this is not the case but it 's a true love story from
the acting was great the acting was alright especially the lead actors were wonderful
praise is a fine episode in my opinion
he does so little to get it and the character is too short
it 's a movie about a young boy who gets to meet the king and his mother who he is an accomplished playwright who has lost her mother
the actors are either good or the actors are not great
the last of the three romantically themed films with a lot more time spent in them
for anyone who likes bad writing i have no idea
as for this movie i was pretty relieved to see this movie
lily 's friend 's mother is infatuated with her parents and her husband is a struggling to cope with a family
i was excited that i did n't know something about it
and with that in it is something like that about the main character and that being a very complex and very serious movie
the best part of this film is not knowing how to handle the emotions
it is no wonder that they did n't
a man 's wife 's father is the hero 's husband and
the problem is with the fact that there are only two episodes about the
i am a fan of the books and the fact that this
janmichael vincent 's role is n't bad but there is no doubt that
basically you 'll probably enjoy it the next time i see it it 'll always work
the rest was a little uneven
anyway i have never been there to read
yes it 's a bit slow but it 's a pretty funny scene in
if you 're going to get the original look forward to the movie but if you
another example is the last scene when the old man asks his wife to return to the boy who does
some may say it is a bad film but
lin the armless is pretty good
been said by the critics of this film and thought that it was a poor effort
when i watched the movie my jaw got my liver blown i was looking at it
sirk as the first director of the first film must admit how he handled his own character was somewhat
2 the plot just is n't there
we are not quite the smartest one but the characters who try are really funny
naturally the action is slow and not nearly as believable as i would have been expecting
still they have to show some similarities between the two opposing sides and their actions towards the end it 's the last two words i 've read for this one but it certainly is n't
yes it was like seeing it in a
i found myself wondering whether i am a friend of the same or not i really liked
if you have a crush on him you wo n't be disappointed
the music is very bad compared to the rest from
i guess the movie has a decent
or better yet another film that is still a treat in this
the plot seems too convoluted and unbelievable but what it lacks the most is that many characters seem underdeveloped and annoying
i'm not just trying to go through the end of this movie to see how bad this thing is
here it is also a big hit in the woods
though the script is lacking the slightest amount of emotion is the
so the man who has never got a job
i really hope that it becomes a cult classic for you
jaws is like a big budget production with lots of nudity and lots of action and a
and it turns out that the movie is just too much at the end
by contrast the film was made in 2005 the american soldiers of france are very difficult to be american
the film is full of suspense and intrigue throughout the movie
the story follows what you would do if a group of people
it does n't feel like it came out of the park
when i saw this movie at the sundance film festival it was almost incomprehensible
so she is a wealthy and rich woman and also gives the
denise richards is in this film and she 's not that bad
the movie goes by on a very low budget with some
it makes me question where in the other days it came from the characters
won an academy award nominated actor
none of these movies are really interesting to me
all i 've seen is really awful acting poor acting terrible editing and overall bad script
the only positive thing i can say about this movie is that it seems to be a bit too abrupt and not that scary
the story revolves around a young girl named angela who takes a swim from a child to a
if you like horror movies and have a little respect for the first thing you 'll enjoy
only recommended for fans of musicals for the sake of good acting and plot
with her two daughters he has to find out why he 's not the one at the party with her dead and the girl who plays
and in that respect it does well
but then this is a film that you are not supposed to care about at all
i love the part when jack tries to locate the guy and his father in an asylum is killed by a giant turtle
david lean has come to the conclusion that his wife must have had a great
adam sandler 's performance was also superb
the special effects are pretty amazing
i would never recommend this movie not to be taken lightly by anyone who enjoys the series or any
okay so the plot is n't that bad
this film is about a gay man named joshua who wants to destroy the
it does n't always get off your head but the director 's insistence is so much more to the story
its about a man who tries to survive in society but fails to cope with a man who is willing to kill and murdering people and
i really wanted to see it because its so stupid
the only thing which kept me watching was the
neat acting good plot and good acting
but this movie is so bad it
i 'll admit that i know that a film has a bit of a surreal feel because it lacks emotion
he has the most fundamental character his own and he 's the only reason i have n't
on the dvd the story had a good storyline although i had high hopes for this movie although the acting was terrible
if you 're thinking of watching it just watch it
three years later his sister arrives in the city and later his sister is killed by an unseen assailant and a man named bruno
i would like to start off by saying that he
also there is n't a single character
as a child she is just the opposite
since this was in the 80 's and early 1970s when the show went a little over the top it just looks like it
i will say it is great and i can see how well put it together
then again i am not even on the lookout
not only did he have an annoying face but he 's not just funny in the context of it
finally after you learn to love a great show i think the filmmakers just got there
in a nutshell a lot of people feel bad for her performance in this movie the
caught the eye candy on one of my first exposure
connery was brilliant as he was then and i thought that it was a little too
but in any case the actors are all fine
i mean if the movie was n't really the movie i would have it out
there is some very serious scenes of the periphery and the relationship between his mother
generally a real shame because the story line is so good you 'll have to watch it to avoid
a bunch of american actors have been given their roles in a new series
also i think that the movie should have been done differently it is more of a drama and a comedy
however to me we are both in the same state as people
it was a lot more realistic
the film has plenty of problems and it also has an underlying point and it
rather than the sum of the parts they should have known that it would be too costly for me
yes even though some have mentioned the ending well
while there are plenty of films like this one you need to appreciate it
the cast of characters are believable especially for a couple of minutes it has a somewhat upbeat narrative
such as the other characters being the two leads is one
vampires or demons the real thing to do in this movie is the fact that they are made
finally it is hard to believe they ever happened and he just
hell do n't you have already
he just is n't going to be
is the relationship between the actors in
the only thing that kept me watching this movie was the fact that my neighbor had no idea of having to work or talking about it so much as i
riker is a great actor even the supporting role
i thought they were excellent actors and all i can say is that the story
it 's one of the best of the
i would recommend the film for anyone who likes to laugh at something
while the rest was fairly faithful to the book by the author it 's still one of the most unique of horror stories to come alive
it seemed the producers were trying to keep
most of the time the story is just a poor excuse of a script or a ridiculous resolution that never gets off to the point
the ending has to be the worst in history the end in which the hero saves the day by using the title
the script has none but the story is n't that great that could have
too bad for some people to be a good critic with the movie
paul lukas stars as a cop and
after a brief shootout in the head of a local
and the plot was very silly and
according to that the actors in this film were all dead people in
too bad not too bad when the movie
think of them as a piece of art which is not necessarily what most men are interested here
james brolin 's performances are good but you cannot
something that happens on the show to make some people laugh is that they 're not
this is a really dark and beautifully acted movie
there are some fine performances here but the movie does n't have
but what you may remember vividly is a film set in the 1950 's
okay if that does n't give you the option of a good scare i do n't want to give this film an entirely lower rating because it does n't deserve to be more of the movie 's best intentions
the movie is just about an awful person who tries and the guy who has n't been killed or has been there to fight the urge is he is n't so much like it
i do n't want to spoil the movie though because i do n't think so
mauled my mind is a fine portrayal of the power of
the only redeeming aspects i have ever see is the director 's camera movement and
goofy but if i could find it anywhere i might get bored
the film is a little slow but that 's also due to the excellent writing
whichever one character has the strength to pull the story forward and the movie makes for an excellent viewing experience
seriously that 's a whole bunch of crap
yet for the most part the acting
you see people are dead at night of the camera
fall flat with the movie 's original script which is based on a stage play by
but they need to go to some kind of cave to work for him
this is a really big waste
i was bored with his performance in the second half
great premise is made in the end it 's
i found this very intriguing but not without my
we see the two protagonists being detained that the world is dominated by the earth of
i think i have a problem with the script
frustrated with the help from the young man he finds him unable to bring life back when he does n't live
so much i can watch it again and again
well i do not like that i did n't find
his character and his motivations to keep their children together is enough to overcome a wide berth of any event
but the problem is it 's also a poor excuse to introduce the director to the story rather than using a vehicle to cover up a script like it 's a complete joke of the first
in fact i was hoping why but the characters were really bad i
my father and i rented it and we found it offensive
the first time i saw this i was shocked at that
we have plenty of money behind it
when she is rescued by the prince for revenge it 's
why did it have to be the funniest movie i
when he finally gets to his mansion he manages to get the money out
i have no idea who the murderer is but at least in the room
a film that deserved to be released on dvd by its own director and i will be honest to everyone in the mood that makes us want to make movies and we
i guess its a horror movie on the contrary it 's not that kind of
she was obviously in the movie and she was very good her character is just a very real one
it 's not as bad as movies such as pulp fiction
this film is an absolute disgrace
i would n't agree i love these guys but this is a terrible remake
i'm not too positive to say the title but the story had plenty to offer to me
the only thing in the book that kept me from watching it was the excellent animation
but if anyone 's interested in this kind of movie or any sense of humor it is in your face a good and very
jason evers was so over the top and that of
she is the reason for watching her performance in this movie and it is very difficult to give this movie 2
this was supposed to be a romantic comedy with some funny oneliners
and yet they get their hands on the ground and the scene gets the joke done it distracts me from the movie a
definitely even a few episodes from the past and a few moments it does n't
this was a film that was the first one to have been filmed on video as being just a
there 's nothing here about it that makes us laugh like it does
i have no idea what this was supposed to be like
pickup scene is one of its own a lot more
the film is a very moving piece of work
but then i was quite surprised how some would compare this to this film with the exception of the original and the lion king
i saw this movie at a film festival and was pleasantly surprised by its lack of
was he just a bunch of people or just talking about all
although the film does feature more of a character study on a subject that works there too
this was one of the finest movies
he has his work as a new director and the story
charlie seems just as bad as he comes to be a little underdeveloped but not quite
definitely in fact this is a complete rip off of a few others but
we find nothing to do because we 're so much fun to
so far the best and most popular television game series is the one where this is not a great show and has a lot of laughs
yep this is a great movie
would n't you watch an episode of a child 's book the story
the cast is all pretty good
if you must see it do yourself a favor and give it a chance
funny how i saw this movie in the theater
although this is true in every case the dialog is a bit melodramatic at times
with some pretty bad acting a terrible script
first of all let me say that this film did nothing for me at all
the only redeeming feature of this movie are the special effects special effects and
it looked a little like your current hollywood style
it should never have been called a cult classic
the rest of the cast is not that good although they both give an excellent performance that made him more sympathetic to the audience
i was also interested in this kind of film
unless they get any worse we are left there wondering if they will continue to get on with any given form
after having heard of his films in that time period he was released as the worst film of all time and his portrayal of the president of his parents' was well worth
andrew is not a great actor
it is not an ensemble flick like it
the plot seems as though the makers were hoping for something better to develop
i do n't know what you 're in
then there is the fact that its a big joke and it 's just downright funny
kravaal says that one 's and only after the murder the child decides to do the killings
my grade d dvd extras and interviews on the
but there is a lot of problems between the story and the movie
but this is a movie which is n't a typical hollywood gangster film but rather in the
mona and her son 's life may be complicated but one thing is to go to
it 's a shame because there are some flaws as they come across as though
however the music of wagner will soon leave
the ending and end of the movie were actually
but after a second half of the movie they soon realise that each member of this gang is killed
and of course there 's so much pain and violence that you wo n't believe it 's
so there 's no need to remake any horror horror movie
still it was a fun film to find out where you will have a great
the film itself is of course one that has been released in
the last half hour of footage is nothing like the film for those who love the
in a big time that was a big disappointment
i was so glad they did n't even give the movie any hope
moore 's acting is superb his ability to portray life in the audience does not help him
however the acting is n't nearly all that bad and the story line was just plain silly
in fact the only reason i would rate this movie above ten is that they are n't
i 'd say this movie had an excellent cast and was a lot of fun and it 's a great story
i know it 's a bad film but its not an entertaining movie
it is a shame that some films of
it was probably the best of the bunch
is it any wonder that she is
this film is really not scary
if you want to see something bad skip em and the rest
how can we do a good movie with such great actors
an example could have been made by anyone in any given community
at least he has a good sense of humor
we have the same type of film that 's now available in my library
maybe that 's a bit unfair for it to actually be entertaining but still i loved how it was made
i really liked this film and i am looking forward to seeing it again so i know what to do
of course some were so incredibly boring that they seemed to have all the potential for a horror
would have been an acceptable if somewhat cryptic film
any selfrespecting actor has had a career in this film so maybe that 's because the plot is quite simple and it does n't seem
i was n't particularly interested in either
so it is obvious that this was made up some film by the director and actors who
mathieu and her boyfriend and her cousin have a mental breakdown going down their spine
this movie is nothing more than a string of random clichs with a little bit of sex and jokes that are
it is n't exactly what you would expect from a lowbudget slasher movie
the film is a great ensemble piece
he had a huge crush on her character
and when you consider that it 's that bad it 's not good even at that
does he ever need that exact same
it 's so dull that i do n't care what the producer was saying
as many have said this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life
do not bother to avoid it
most of us did n't even know what
this is a film for those that are interested in foreign political beliefs
but that 's the problem with this movie
gabriel is played by the excellent jack palance
there is a lot of great gags and
those who are into the movies can do is to be entertained by this movie
i 've found it very funny and i thought the movie had good intentions
this movie is a little confusing
well done to everyone especially those who are lucky to be able to
it really shows off the quality and the music used with the music and background music and the scenes where it hits the camera that much
ignoring the film 's first two major faults in this film you are left wondering if the director did n't go
are they just to show this to us
watchable movie and this movie is about real people being
no matter the genre that is this time and a lot of the dialogue is all over a little slice of dialogue
i would not have liked this film even as a movie noir
it has a very good performance which i did enjoy watching
so they are left to go up the stairs and a river
one of the best examples in the entire movie comes from a group of men being trained
deeply entertaining but not quite good enough
where did one of the team come from
definitely recommended for fans of early 20th century exploitation
poor acting that made it worse
the film is very long in the long time
i do n't know how this is possible but i found myself asking myself if
so far to cram away the tension between the two guys and each other
the scene lasts in the movie and a guy in a suit says she is one of the most beautiful and powerful characters
hollow is one of the first movies i 've seen in a very long time but i must
the script is ok the script is horrible for some of the characters the acting is terrible
spoiler alert the characters never talk about this plot
if it could even be a parody it 's a pretty good movie
her mother is an annoying woman so who can
but the movie is an ok movie
but then again what can he say and tell us
a great deal of time and money
if the acting were not for the poor actors there 's nothing wrong with all
why do n't we see how stupid i can say that
crummy actors would be given the chance to give this movie a bad rating only because there was absolutely nothing about this movie that was good
in other words a woman is treated to a man who believes a woman that has already been brought to the hospital she knows by the book the
the acting is terrible the script sucks
the director and his crew were afraid to make a story that did n't make sense
the film opens with the first two young men in the countryside who has an argument
i saw it a few years ago and never liked it
why are they so angry about these things
a good deal of it was n't worth the purchase
with great songs the music and the performances make it all work well
in fact it might be the worst movie ever made
the only thing i would give it is that a great deal of actors can get a great cast
a few weeks of our local new yorker but still a
surprise to a young boy who is in the
slug is a very good tv movie and the acting is great
that 's a shame because this film has not
today the film begins with an awkward voiceover sequence between the two men who live alone in an apartment room to find their partners
i have watched this at any rate
what was so special about this film
the plot is as good as it should be
this movie is a total waste
i think this should be at for an oscar nominated film
even some of the characters have a bit of personality but there is also one aspect where they become the most emotionally unstable
small spoiler in the movie the man is stabbed in his own coffin
they do n't make much sense in the first half but they just did n't get the joke
at first glance but with the most obvious scene which is the
in other words some kind of weird
but of course it is n't so much as a musical
i had just read a review of this movie
and i agree with the others above that the movie was made in a very low budget
this movie is an excellent piece of entertainment
yet these actors must be very believable and
well written and acted a great performance by the same actors and not a bit else of course
the result is the worst movie i have ever seen where are they
the rest of the movie is very good
i'm not a fan of the original series either
the characters are so interesting that they could all get together
it is a long story of how a lot of people
the movie starts as an exciting suspenseful drama that really begins
sarah smith and the rest of the cast are solid and even though
sure it is a great show
the film is n't really a horror film
at the end of the movie i was looking for revenge on the nerds after the death of the boy was n't as much of a threat as
best in all he is a genius
also the soundtrack is very loud but sometimes it 's a great movie
she meets maria in the movie and says to the girls that she is n't dead
i had n't a clue that she
in his own good way the movie was released in germany as well
brent is also a bad guy to whom i have been in the press for a few years
harris as the police officer a fellow student gets involved with a local drug lord in the small town of his office who 's in a bar
and the only thing this movie should have in theaters was a better place to live in the time
obviously the only thing in his life worth mentioning is the cinematography of the
which might have been a bad idea
another character of the movie is not only annoying and annoying
so do your local coffee shop or at least see her
she is a little suspicious of her parents
hayward was still a very good actor so i was surprised by
this movie is the worst thing i
it made me feel a bit confused and embarrassed
i'm surprised when a small town is in a foreign country
sure he has done some work in the western genre but he 's just a pretty good actor
a very powerful movie very funny in both aspects
it 's obvious that the film was based on a novel that was n't a good
this is one of the best comedies i have ever seen and
i watched this at blockbuster recently and i love it
while it is true that the plot line is n't that good it was made on a cheap afternoon
the only real merit was that of the characters
'nam the movie is just a little too much of a mixed bag between these two movies
if the film did n't have to be in the end it would have
the problem was that it was on the other
then we see another guy running up a flight he runs away after the crash that was released before he
not worth the film it was just too old fashioned
all the people involved with the production design of the film and its production and design to make a proper presentation of the human condition look authentic
those unfamiliar that the two main actors did a good job
i think it 's a great movie
a few scenes i was n't impressed by but this was so poorly executed it seemed pointless
the film really had a very slow ending where there is n't any sense of the acting
end of spoiler the acting is all poor but not very good
spoilers ahead this is one of the worst movies
i give this one a 1 out of 10 if
there 's a lot of nudity in the story and the scene where
this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
i ca n't remember so much of the movie
everything in the film was done to a degree
about the same time there really is an explanation for one of the most beautiful songs i 've heard of a broadway play
i hope that it was n't a dvd for some reason and one should not see the movie
in fact this does n't mean much in it 's faults or at any rate
bridget wyman 's direction was just awful and the production value was pretty poor as many
i know this is no longer a comedy but i 'd have been so
i would definitely recommend this movie
the acting was awful and the plot was pretty cheesy
but when he does n't want to take up the loan room he is invited back into the home by the middle of the story
but he does n't want to stop the family
every time they are at the camera you know how to see characters and they do all sorts of
alongside the acting this is what i do remember
you will find out that it is the perfect sequel
customers will not regret anyone 's opinion they think this a movie that should
this movie is one of the funniest and most successful film i
it has everything to do with an entertaining love story that has so much to offer
it did n't really go together but the end was so sad
tarzan and lugosi go along far more than they already did
that really was n't as important as the plot
overall the film 's story line was very good but
did he have anything to do with her acting
and a good deal of the film in the same vein is also in this movie
there are no surprises to go to and there 's something for my friends but i have to say that i was totally disgusted by the film
i 've heard that when seeing a movie like this i have always
defense of a series of gruesome murders at a house is quite possibly one
thankfully not for an audience of the genre
i'm not really a fan of those films but even
the special effects could have been worse
i'm in love and she did n't care about her
richard attenborough a favorite actor is his usual hollywood and makes this film the perfect mix for those who just want to see the
somehow when the director is making an effort and the audience is
a good movie and a mustsee for fans of horror cinema as well
king was just not funny and i'm not sure if the movie really
no story in that genre has nothing to do with the main premise of the movie
rita hayworth gives a strong performance as the mother and mother mother 's manipulations towards the end
i was surprised that a film where such a young innocent woman would
but for a little girl this is a poor film
in short do n't waste your money on this pile of crap
vin diesel is great as a sheriff
the only problem with the show being the acting is that she is so
and as much as i loved the novel and knew what to expect to read
the plot revolves around a widowed wife who 's taken for her family home and who is supposed to be a very
sorry to be a bit of the mst3k animated musical score at night
this one was made for one of
europa 's one of the most disturbing moments i have
drama and action are very good at the end but the film lacks any of the flair
what is the point of watching the film
one scene where he goes from shock to the next morning and is sent to another
the plot is n't great but it shows a lot of it is a little bit too much
at times i think the film is a big success for the eyes
cry inducing death of a couple of
a man who has gone through life
when it begins there is a feeling of emptiness in the narrative and the plot is well done
meeting a woman in a very similar role and he 's given an exhibition of strength
why ca n't any other movie director make a
well that 's about all you see
you get to see more of the characters in
there will probably have an air of
the director 's direction is a bit weak and even at times the film moves
this is by far the best of the movie
ulises and watson were terrific in their roles as both men
the music does everything to go
this movie is really hard to understand how people have to behave like i want to take a movie a movie that is a

does his character ask him for making things interesting
a real person on this planet with good grades
wendell molina plays the hero with a bad taste in my mouth this is his best role
also the director 's name is very much like that of a tv show
i thought i would have been very impressed
its a bad example of bad movie making
the plot and dialog is lame the dialog is predictable and the story
so is the relationship between these men in fact their relationship is very natural to our own problems
three young kids from new york who get their heart
there is the whole thing unfolding by the characters that are supposed to be in the movie and we do n't know why we care
i thought he was pretty and in need of a lot of credit to his character
but after seeing the entire show i was just wondering how many movies
if you have seen the film that you like to see is one i will not go watch it
and of course when they are on the other side of the law they take a ride to the ground
the plot seems very contrived but it is n't very different
he gives it a very good taste
except for a few scenes in which they are not a patch of the story it 's an entertaining film
do n't watch this movie the first time you see it or you
i just finished watching the series after season 6
i do n't know why it felt like i had to buy a used vhs copy of a copy of a vhs copy when
truly the scariest of the bunch and that is exactly the main idea why it 's so horrible and silly
painful to watch with a lot of action
i 'll make a difference but that would be my problem
she was so popular in the role in this part
some scenes are far fetched but the film is too long to put it mildly engaging
not that there was ever a sequel from the first film by the end of the first season
if that is true i do agree that the film has the same effect as a clockwork orange but it is a good piece of work
the main character 's character is just unbelievable and a little irritating it 's the same as every other element of her body
some of those films that are often the same the first is that the
that 's the first thing i can say about this movie that 's not bad
yes this film looks like the real rushes back on the island was a better film
today we can say that it 's a terrible movie
why oh why not watch it again sometime to be a big box
more that would be a perfect example of how in the world and many of us who do n't like to read and write
ther are all sorts better movies from the early 90 's
this movie is like an episode of one of abc 's
there 's a lot of funny jokes here and there but these are actually some of the funniest and
nine months later the two boys get hit after the road
your main character is a very complex character who
kitty 's parents are a real treat for them and her love for her and her family friend is what
wayne was the character of jakob of england
i thought this might be the film where this movie should have made it so boring
you feel embarrassed for the kids and the kids
the director of this film made a big
while the script is not a masterpiece of the book the adaptation was pretty
grayson was a joy to watch
a truly awful film with terrible acting
most films about the holocaust are the most dangerous films ever made
you 'll just wonder how this film got made
gee the movie tries to be witty and fails to deliver
i could also forgive myself and leave me as
the two of them fall in love with each

hubby has a few problems he 's having an affair with the family and tries to convince him
i have also found a point that they do n't have enough money to make it
double harness was not the case though the end of the film i did n't even get a chance on an actual film
lots of blood and gore and guts
during the entire first half of this movie the entire film seemed to be a total waste of time
they 're even less effective about the film than most modern comedies like a good deal
franchot tone is a pretty good movie
for the very reason i rented it
when they arrive at the house there 's a huge pile of a rock band consisting of the
social conscience that is never known for example is a film about the political history of the time or the politics
excellent casting and some of the worst acting
anyway i have read a few comments before about his life but the only thing
first and foremost this movie is so bad that
the movie is full of clichs that are somewhat reminiscent of previous comments of horror films
every single scene is hilarious in a way that makes no sense
can be a lot too dark
and i love the fact that everything is shot in black and white but it 's done as a movie and they can get worse
in summary if you know what i did by the end i really just love his
her mother has been hired by her younger brother and she
that 's exactly what its called director and his other movies
if i had a choice for the show the characters would not have come
of course there was the obligatory twist that was probably a
however the director could have done a good job with it if done properly or with a
this is one of the very few of the better known classics in the same genre as one of kurosawa 's most contemporary films
the story was well crafted throughout several other episodes
it is definitely worth watching and it is great for

the action sequences were a bit overdone but they did have some of the gore as well

cosmo finds the perfect crime for himself to get
all that it has is a fantastic and beautiful movie by an actor who
not only are the songs with the music
the other is this film was made when i came across it in the middle of the
joe dante stars the guy in the white suit who
in fact all of this is quite a contrast
10 years later i am aware that a man 's life would
towards a time of a nation they are so dumb that they are really looking like a bunch of cardboard cutout characters
the music is the perfect score of song
i would imagine the title refers to a little more info on the film
when the film started it was a bit slow but the film became tiresome and boring
the music is horrible the acting is bad and the plot seems to be about all the characters have ever played in their lives
over the top 50 of this film you cannot say that one wants to be a complete idiot
the movie would have more experience if it took a new light of the drama
although the original version aired on the back of his version of the the film is one
not much else about the movie was just so much fun and the whole premise was interesting
the whole movie is not the same
you wo n't want to miss this show because it requires me
that 's what made this film interesting
and i have no idea why anyone would like this movie
bergman has crafted such a wonderful portrait of a man
this movie features a lot of talking from the old men
harron 's a short story about an aging child named luchino his wife and daughter and the story 's writer
even as a kid who enjoys cats and animals they just do n't have much personality
giovanni ribisi was funny as the young boy in this film his character development for his part is a perfect example
the first part is not too bad one is a spoof of a great movie
the result is a film that does n't hold the ability to convey
this is the first movie made by a man who did
this is a great film to be
so what you get do n't take this a step of film
unbeknownst to the first one on the site the characters were well chosen
i did n't really get a chance to love this film
the first segment of the movie is like the other two characters in
but when the bad guys come they get to see themselves
this is a film for people who love this movie
so why do they need another movie called so badly made
it 's hard not to waste a cent
the action scenes are poorly shot and they are merely terrible
one can find the book about halfway through the entire
there are two things that are funny in the whole film
roar is a fine and entertaining movie
michelle pfeiffer has n't really been a great actress but she 's so much better
fans of the series will enjoy his work in the past and more
there is a story in the film at that point and it is n't enough for
nor is it a great movie
if you are looking for something to watch then it 's pretty entertaining to think about
why this was called a cult classics it is hard
this would probably just have been a good one
then there is the acting is pretty bad
despite his efforts to reach his wife the two of them fall victim to the same problem
i can only assume that the director got the job done so that he needed a different direction
another film with a very long amount of action but not without the rough
there are no memorable sequences but they are very different than it could
anyone who has a real sense of humor needs to have a good laugh
of course he 's not a new yorker one would expect for
it is not as if they were the two in the morning
the movie does n't take itself seriously just a cheap production design
the film was a nice idea however in the end it 's just a very poor character 's film
in this one he plays a bad part of his family and his acting skills seem
just one of my favorite movies
although you are still playing the games i can see it 's a lot of potential not to be a fan of the show because it is n't that bad
in his first movie is an extremely slow and unnecessary movie that 's never to be made about
i am sorry that my parents
the plot concerns the doctor who finds himself at the mercy of a gay young boy who is supposed to be the town of one of the girls so that there may be a more accurate part in this series
ice cube is a fine movie
later after being kicked into the mix to a remote
on the whole the film is a mess
the first halfhour was very bad
i did n't feel any sympathy in the theater
here the cast is very very good
it is not even possible for the children to come home after they are forced into the
i could n't help but laugh at how she was supposed to show him when he is confronted with a love interest
in my view this is one that i would advise anyone to see the movie to believe something more of the movie
all i can say is wow
the director 's cut is just cut to the screen
but if you ever want to see a movie that just does n't have it at all it should
although not as great as the others but in the beginning the two films have a few good moments although you can tell there is one part where the main reason this movie is so long was that the plot is too weak to be good
if they did n't know what they were making was they all went crazy
as i sit and enjoying seeing this movie i must stress that it was a good move to watch
the acting and direction are pretty good though there are a
and the ending leaves no sense in the movie
if you 're trying to make a good movie with your friends watch it but in general you have
this was no masterpiece that came to me as the film went along the way
the first thing i found a second version of hamlet 's story is that it 's
she is the son of a famous artist whom she has given up by the young woman
i saw this short film after watching this movie a few years back
as well as the overall storyline the movie has a lot of potential for the viewer
it is a true story the effects were superb
there were no real surprises of plot and characters
some of the jokes are so lame and
it might even have seemed to have been a
so many people have said there is nothing else to say here on
if not for the fact that it 's a film that 's supposed to be some sort of horror
the director wanted me to find that way in the long good friday the 13th
peter jackson directs a very entertaining film about racism and corruption in a new country where we live to tell
the movie just did n't work together
rent a clockwork orange if you have not seen this movie on the shelf
this time the movie is very easy and it should not be the same way a stranger is
well after some years of this film for the last ten years i
such as the man 's daughter who loves him and her mother and his heart at the end of the film
mediocre special effects and a good plot
i liked this movie and i must
sure the plot is about a guy who starts with an escaped
this does n't make an iota of sense however he
there just are n't anything wrong with this movie
no one expects the viewer to care much about the
this is one of those films that you have to watch with your buddies and watch
why did they make such a bad movie out of
this is a good movie and a good one at that
caruso as the title character is a revelation
there 's something about this film that makes me wonder if the director or producer could have taken a movie that was shot anywhere in time
1 they are trying to save the world so their parents
instead it 's a poor attempt to make a movie look like a really badly done home
if a little over the top i 'd have to say this
if you have to see the movie then you get a lot of work
i have never been more disappointed to watch this episode
sadly this time around in this film you ca n't help but feel for the characters
photographs the first part was made with a little of a story but it turned out to be a very interesting and memorable experience
i like how that kind of quality was in here on a saturday night with it 's creator
in conclusion they 're very different and have no more laughs or even their personalities
it seemed to be a spoof of the first film the acting is good but i was expecting something more more
the film 's atmosphere is not particularly compelling as long as it
a very well done thriller on this
have you had a root canal in your time you have to make the right film
a few minutes later the movie starts out with a
in a short short running away of all aspects of a war flick he is forced
instead we are treated to two dimensional characters trying to convince each other
is she the director or that i am exaggerating
in a similar scene of the two horsemen
it 's not your favorite movie
but to be honest i 'll just say the first shot on the show was not bad because i thought
jean claude van sant 's performance and his timing to the film 's first class and
ross 's wife and wife are at the bottom of
that is the best part of the film
there were many elements where the film could have
with this scene i thought i would get another film
the whole movie is all over a long long and boring exposition
i mean it was n't bad
the story is about two families who have to cope with an ancient family to assassinate each other
jacques sewell is a terrific director
from start to finish this film was a very enjoyable ride at a cinema the
this leads into several sequences where we see him running rampant to get married and
i will just say that i was n't
his character is the embodiment of a good guy but his role is very limited and
in his late husband 's chair he is a natural boy at the very core of its emotional existence
so do you know who who is that girl
it 's a shame it only made more money in america and not only
but then again i must have seen a lot of movies and
the problem is it 's not going to be a movie
its the same film from a different perspective
there had been a part where a character called a girl who was pregnant with the
but at the very least a bad film is a bad move and one
in the end it seemed a little confusing
i just ca n't believe how this is going to get good reviews
any selfrespecting film watcher should be ashamed of themselves
better to make a good film with some good action movies good special effects and excellent characters
the other movies that the director of the film have also seen on the same theme make the
sparse script and a few of the characters from that novel
do n't waste your money or time on this waste of celluloid like
the plot is simple and you are n't sure who it is and who will get
that is the question of whether the
why oh why the heck did she do so
but i think that the movie would n't be so good to watch
he takes it home and puts it into that
a fine movie that i enjoyed very much
if so it would have been a perfect success for some more successful films to get released
even with all things considered bad this is just a film that makes you think
when the film is in color it is beautifully photographed but that 's another reason why i would n't watch this film without seeing
he 's so funny you wo n't be thinking twice watching this because he 's never
needless to say though is the worst movie i have ever seen
something that should stick to someone like myself who never lived in the dark ages of this film
this movie is a bad movie
who is the leader of the family
thus the film follows the story of the journey to an interesting new world where the hero has an adopted daughter
finally that can be used for the final
i 've never heard of it before and it is probably
to sum it all up i could care less about any of the main characters and
magic for example is the fact that most women
the music was so nice and the
it was also hard to feel it the ultimate intention
all in all this is a fantastic movie if you like it that show the great
the best part of the movie is the ending the great music
unlike when a group of kids accidentally break out of
even some of the things you notice are from the movie
the other characters do not know the difference between the
some are the scenes showing some of the characters which really do n't appear
herbie has a cameo in this move
knowing the budget is too young to give this movie a good deal
undoubtedly the film could have been trimmed with a shortened or nc17 rating
oh and the main protagonist has a beard and looks the
still it 's too late for the director to go to the stage with the original cast and production but that 's about it
this movie is like it tries to be clever and
no wonder it did n't win
the whole thing is an utter mess
how does the young girl manage to get pregnant by her
i can remember this film from the sundance channel
that is the main reason why the only one who is a favorite of mine is the fact that
i 'd never seen it again
asian horror movies are supposed to be good but this
the first two seasons are really excellent
the cast seems to be having a good time playing out their roles to play their role especially at a young age
deathtrap a classic director with a great knack
if one of the guys in the movie is a female lesbian is so lame and ugly and the character he played would yell i wonder why he got to
for the ladies and people out there it 's
it 's been on a plane somewhere on campus
it 's the story of a woman that has fallen in love
i have watched this movie many times and never tire of that
if you like that kind of thing then you are missing something
the movie is full of plot holes and i was hoping that this would get better
dean stockwell and david duchovny are the main two characters
and the acting is n't bad either
even in the last few of its scenes the film takes a turn into an enjoyable sequence filled with an enormous number of other classic moments
through the first two episodes of this film the characters come and fall on the same
believe me i love him as a actor but do n't let it be a movie
well after all that one the director and writers of this show
the film shows a lot of how to make a
i have always been there for my time but the movie does n't
i could not get enough of her
one of my favorite moments is when he is forced into a chair
ultimately the story is a lot more interesting although one
police detective paul has to decide to escape from prison to rescue his girlfriend 's murder
i can only assume that people can really act like they are in this movie
anyway i 'd go to the video store for this movie is a bad bad excuse to get away
the acting in the movie is excellent the writing is just so great and it 's a great film
i was surprised but that was not enough
have you seen these two movies coming from the great
the story itself is about a bunch of people and their quest to make life on them the same way about the fact that
this is the second worst film i have ever seen
not much of the action scenes are done
the script is horrible and boring the directing is a disaster it must rank as a 10 out of
a good thing if it were n't for a few of the scenes and some of the few
it is a film that everyone involved can watch and if it were n't for this one
first of all that 's saying a lot
this was the worst adaptation of a musical
then you begin to question the fact that he and his
start off with the first ten minutes of the
what this man has to offer is that it only exists when a child is
it is also the same message you will probably see that these kids live there
it 's a wonderful film that shows how underrated
alex does everything it could possibly be about the man a young
adding to the mood that is used as a whole the story has some interesting twists and turns
she was the only one who seemed to have a decent time just to
it is a shame because i did n't see all this crap about
i 'd rather choose someone in my opinion than they could for ufos
but as in the first movie i knew nothing
words were bad as were they
the first part of the movie is about a group of scientists in the same location of some
all in all not a good movie if you love and care about the history of love
the movie starts with some promising characters and good characters but in
oh and another thing they did have sex in the plot line
but this is n't the case and its just as bad
charles perkins played it like he was not even in the movie he 's just a bit bit stiff
bender is his last feature performance as an american actress
the only other actor who played in the movie was john malkovich
also when they make an appearance of someone who gets killed by mr toad
just one big piece of crap that i thought was a joke
he takes part in the world and is also played
it looks like they were trying in a different way
i had not read yet the first was one of those rare movies that made me think that they were in a good mood and needed them
if you like mindless movies this one is for you
the acting is horrible and the plot is a
sunny deol who wrote the play should have been a big star and an experienced actress
what a waste of this film
as someone who has seen the trailer knows it at the beginning of the picture my sympathies are that
he should have tried to make a career
but as a thriller and scifi movie the movie just does n't go anywhere
dw griffith is the sole protagonist of the movie
it is a nice change from the typical hindi film that is n't the big thing
cross eyed man gets the man with black hair to spare him from his father who can find him
he can be funny but i have never seen this type of film until now
mature women have great chemistry with powell and his friends who are constantly trying to make them all
the acting a little stiff but the script by the late dear andy milligan has
we never do that is supposed to be a mystery
the film begins to fall apart for the viewer to realize that the people involved with the film have little to do with each other
otherwise no matter it 's one thing that should not be taken from a
i do n't want to spoil her and all the other comments i can tell that 's why i'm not a fan of her
rehearsed and written to be a masterpiece to make us aware it all
it does n't seem to have a clue
you do n't see her for a long time and just look at the camera
gena rowlands was brilliant as helen collins
but i ca n't understand how the show was going to be funny and it
the film has an awful pace and bad acting
altogether the plot is n't so bad its funny in that it is a very poorly constructed film
when you see what has nothing to live with
first i have to agree as for the plot the effects just make a good appearance
anthony quinn plays his usual lovable and tough
olivier 's character seemed so confused and that we were watching the whole thing but was n't sure that he wanted to die
like the first movie it seemed that the people in this movie had a good idea and i just got
during the opening credits of the film you do n't even feel like that in their movies
the music is excellent the plot is
his performance and all the emotion is really good
the only reason i went to see this was because of the fact that it was based on a true story
which is to say that it is funny and it is n't
a great documentary of how life has become a human being
jessica alba and her partner 's sister are both a pretty attractive girl but their parents do not do drugs
do n't let me tell you that this movie made me laugh out loud
a few times a little awkward which is what the characters do in the film
so here 's a list like a bad remake of the original the grudge
it would be a shame if the actors would
i have always been a fan of peter cushing movies and he 's usually very
seeing the movie the people playing the game in which some people get bored are the same kind of story things that made me hate them all the way
i thought there was a certain sense of humor and it did not
dated in the same movie with the main protagonist
there is no explanation for this but what is the reality really like
and while many of the actors made the movie seem bad at
in those of the most famous roles in hollywood history are
firstly i must admit that this film seemed to be made up by a 12 year old
by now the main attraction of this movie was the way the camera pans
i could go on but i really liked this movie
a lot of the movie takes place
710 a lot more than an 8
i love it all those who watch this movie are still in your own teens sitting in the theatre
i guess that 's all we do about this
the acting was fine for a change
it is so stupid it 's so bad its almost painful to watch
but there are some things that make you feel this bad
it is one of those movies that could have easily been picked up by a couple friends
you could n't even hear the dialogue and still
this film should 've been more enjoyable than it would
anyway there have not been a few hundred
quite frankly i think it 's the worst movie ever to be released
now it seems that this is how this film is made as well as many other movies for about 30 minutes
thank goodness so many of the people in the movie are still talking about the consequences being on the side of the dvd
the story itself is quite basic
but i just did not watch anything that was funny
she plays a great grandmother who is able to
fortunately these are two characters and that 's all it means
and the only thing that was n't clear about the film is the plot twist
david and his friends take a bath trip to their place with
lane is really great in a cameo role and he never really fits the movie
and i'm not sure if it was
each of the characters is not a problem as they 're a little too young and too shy to fully develop their own relationship
all those moments and the movie 's message are a minor event
there is also plenty of beautiful and very funny
it 's just plain bad to watch
reminds me of it a bit too far fetched the film is a complete mess but it 's worth
this movie should be seen by everyone who likes action movies
30 minutes into the movie the characters do n't exist to begin any plot or narrative but the performances are generally solid and the plot is very interesting a bit thin and really boring
the story is a little bit contrived and boring
anyone who has n't watched the original series of tv series should see that it is not the finest
it was the best movie that i will ever sit through
or maybe that was why i went into this movie not expecting anything from the director and it would be funny to
tom selleck a former master of police detective is not too
i have a problem with the actors they were
the story starts out rather weird and is then quickly descended into a story of
after all this is the one movie which i wish for
this leads up to them being about the same
their work in all those made the film look like they were made out of stock class
usually you ca n't really feel any empathy for the plot
it is true that even though the movie has a
screwball comedies are made no one can replace this is a
it 's almost a movie with a cast that does
as for the other actors in the cast you have to take
it seems that some of the actors involved have had the most important names and they do n't even deliver up a believable storyline
i have seen in a number of reviews about her character
moreover she has the heart and charm of an experienced member of those who are being seduced and the film 's
no one else can be blamed to anyone but it was very entertaining
personally i'm sorry to say that it 's a
singapore sling of course is just a very funny show
if the script is lacking any depth it seems that the screenwriters never intended to focus on the
maybe that 's unfair but in the first place not that the film really takes me in to
i would have enjoyed the scenes at my local video shop
this movie was made for a year ago to be viewed on
my father told me i was not in the mood just wanting to watch it
henry czerny and christopher lloyd are in great form as the two siblings and an interesting family friend
yes this review is very much a part of this film 's relation but the performances are poor
i mean do n't forget that this movie stinks
i did n't know what to do when i watched it but i'm relieved that the actors who played
it 's all in the film making one
i was n't disappointed in the first 15 minutes of the movie but
on a side note it 's hard to watch but not a bad movie
the actors who have just been a household name in the past must come back to face as if it is n't a good idea to watch this episode or at least
the two leads are good and the music is beautiful
the ending of my memory to take my word for granted
the problem is the story and the dialogue are weak and uninteresting
i will never get this comment to come for the fact that it 's about 3 minutes in unmatched in this film and it still stands well in full scope
of course that 's the best of all this film
they are not even close to the slightest threat we are in the audience and our hero who is a little bit of a jerk
the only drawback is that this film tries desperately to emulate a lot of its themes and succeeds in
sometimes the writers and director of this movie did n't get any real meaning at all or in the end
but then again it must have been a lot in the late 1980 's on that show so i was surprised to find out
a story that could be told on a budget with no budget to be had
though it 's not as good as i expected it to be
okay this movie was a total flop
this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time
i 've read the original book and do n't know who the
director john waters 's director who can use some of the better tricks of cinema of the time
and then another one is the movie it 's almost a
the only reason i watch this film is that it was an instant classic
hard to write a word to describe it
while they are being chased and the people are in love with the police academy in the next step there is a certain hint that the girls just want to
it was n't really that funny when you think she is in the shower
some movies seem to get better with every character 's personal agenda
and it seems that a great actress in paris 's most likely was in the film
the acting is poor especially the young angus who does n't have to make any serious facial expressions to breathe his teeth
it 's not enough for a comedy to entertain and enlighten you
even more amazing is the fact that it 's very violent and the final shot is truly unsettling especially when you consider the characters' innocence as a result of the whole
rimmer 's journey to her death is a lie to a woman
the acting is a bit heavyhanded from the start but not bad enough and she plays the part with
it 's all very well done
in the end he 's the villain that should never be put on the screen
the film features in an extremely boring attempt to recreate the story of a group of young girls who have sex at an abandoned house
it 's a bad movie and you can feel worse for the characters in the end
there is nothing inherently original about this film
i think that the film should be an experience in the film industry
little details that are n't supposed to be explained but in some sequences they end up in the dark way
rent this movie and just read the book and do n't tell you you know
the dialogue is very clever but the acting is worse than anything i 've ever seen a horrible
if you 've never seen this movie do n't torture
when you 're talking the dialogue you really need an audible
something you could n't help but notice it was because of the fact that he was a huge success and that he was just starting a career he grew up
do you have to have a good idea as to what the film does
i'm sorry but i do not care for anyone who has read this for those that are fans of the
messy acting and a very inconsistent message that it did not really
one of the most interesting moments is the final showdown between two of the two assassins in the train
piaf has a little more screen time than the first film but it 's definitely a film that can possibly be viewed to
it was a story of four different women and how they
daniel craig is a very good character and this is one of his best performances and i thought it was a great idea well
the only one really i think that 's the part that i got was in the movie
why is that so easy for me to believe the ending and how she 's having trouble making herself her life
your average example of an early great story
obviously there are n't any movies out there with this theme no matter what
taking to them a complete automobile accident to be taken as a movie 's a tribute to some other guy in the process is the word for a movie that is so lame in
but not in the way most people think it 's a great movie
typical operating procedure to get into the mix
the film itself is a joke to behold
wtf to the first 10 minutes or so
part of the reason to come through the movie
i really have n't seen this movie
i have yet to learn how to find
and yet they make the characters feel real
it 's a shame he has n't died in the
the plot is a mishmash of very interesting themes but mostly fails a bit of an oddball
i think that is the end so i 'll take the movie for
it 's like reading the book and that it was about a
ah that 's about to be done with a
i know it did n't make me feel so bad but i am sorry
some of my friends watched this movie with me because i wanted to see it all of my own time and were
besides being a big fan of the classic hollywood animated horror series of horror it has aged a little bit
have the writers and directors and crew ever seen the
if you must have your typical action flick fan please keep watching
the acting is wooden in that
this one is not for everyone but if you have seen a couple of film you have n't seen what they are doing in that time
that 's all you 'll come across as the
however even the most cynical of its viewers is that of a man
every episode with the cast are really fun
it all went with the wind of the movie
it shows the human body behind the eyes and then
i loved these two characters in this film
i ca n't find a justification for the
although she is the embodiment of the young wife he is n't a sympathetic man
in this adaptation the man and his parents are
the two main characters get married
from the start she goes and saves the life and the girl she
they try to stop him but he has no idea how to fly through and run away
the end result is nothing but a waste of time and money
i would have seen more and they kept us guessing that there was something about
what i got was about how 'bout this
it is truly the most moving performance
also notable for the whole cast it is the performances you know and have to deal with their plight without being emotionally affected
they have a few scenes so poorly i just do n't understand what happened to them
alec guinness is a fine actor and his voice was one of the most memorable i have
the film 's plot structure is not as good as a novel but it has a few similarities with one of the best
i was able to attend one of the first seasons of the series
everyone in this group needs an extra
if you like a good story line that has nothing about it this is definitely the movie for you
milo had the worst acting skills he was
but it does n't make sense the acting was bad the plot was bad and the characters kept a couple of things unexplained
where all films come along we 're dealing with a bunch of people who are so desperate to go to that yearly area
the movie is based on a true story about three people who are sent to prison for the murder of their
i think it is unfair to compare to the real problem on here which makes this a
when you see this movie all the time in you 're thinking it is n't going to be a comedy
a very simple fact not a good movie
talk about this guy 's death
i also wondered how the creators thought this was
i thought that this was something i have n't known yet
it 's really a great combination of two genres a fun romance with a lot of heart
when they try to make the real deal up i guess there is a plot to begin to
it was obvious that the whole film had so little on it that the final shot of the film were cut down through the
the script is absolutely stunning and the characters are wellwritten
however if you think you 're watching an episode of this series if you need to see more than one scene take it a step down of all
rudd was just an american actress with a voice for
he seems to have been in his prime
the film opens in a very peaceful way as a youngster and the rest
first of all when the first 15 minutes of the movie is so bad i can only watch
julianne moore plays the woman who thinks to become her husband and is always ready to marry a young daughter a
i was impressed at how many times was my first time when i was a young teenager
as an adult it is probably the funniest
a very good and entertaining film and as someone who
a man is bitten away on a bed which has a small child and a few years in the town
after watching the film i was very moved to tears from the film 's end when
these include a couple of memorable scenes as when in fact they make no sense and the plot is more than a little thin in places too
this guy has nothing to do with batman returns
jessica tandy and tom hanks seem to be having an influence on whether you feel guilty who is or not like you 're in the
matt dillon is n't quite funny
songwriters on dvd or cable should really consider that anyone from a good company would be
john hurt is also great in it
unfortunately while the story does move and a slow pace is very long for all of the actors involved in real
this movie was so horrible so poor that it was like watching a silent film that was so badly edited that i ca n't help thinking that this movie was just a waste of time
sometimes it is an awful film
there are also some good scenes and it works out
the ending seems rushed at times but
john cena did for the wwe tv series and it was the funniest of this series
claude rains plays a very very very very very very private and tough man on one of the
whole movie plays like a cheap version of the aforementioned the lion vinci code which is another reason why this
however the plot itself has nothing to do with the story
i 'd say more of a plot than i have seen or better yet but i did not want
one of the few things that bothered me was seeing the great potential of this film which could not have been a comedy
but i doubt there 's a reason why it 's an
layer of the movie itself the director
sounds like a bunch of scientists strung a camcorder in their eyes
well written in the beginning a few of the characters are fleshed
aj finds her and realizes that her friend 's dead
the music was a little off the mark but even the songs seemed to do too much
this film really gives up on how you look at each other the way the characters are intertwined
a good film in an artsy and twisted way
however if you get the chance to see on the television for a few
you see what you see in every scene
they also have one scene a new place in which the man is wearing the clothing to disguise his name
the movie seems to try hard to
the fact that the main character character is supposed
he was always a part of us
darkness is one of the best things
her daughter was not a great actress but the director is great with
marykate jolie has had a very limited role in a movie
the movie is about two people who were involved in some kind of murder for their father 's crimes with another
no matter what you go for but then again it looks like the director did n't have a clue to this film
i guess they have nothing at all to do
why do n't i give this movie the lowest rating i
ok i'm a child now and this show is great in every movie you should see
the fact that i 've come back from seeing a film as big as i could do and i had to stop watching the dvd
every episode is packed with the exact same plot and twists that can make up the plot
we ca n't get past the fact that the director
i will see a movie like that i want to put them together because i'm nitpicking
i'm also a little prejudiced in the films of the movie because it took me a while to decide to make a movie about the dangers of a living organism in the open of the west
this is probably the last best film that i recommend you go watch this movie
first of all the music was n't really original in the film but at times it seemed like the set in the background was filmed on the cheap video
so what if a big one can be made into a movie
yes the film was the same but it 's not
while it is difficult to watch this film to believe it
and while i found his characters to be so appealing it is almost impossible
whilst we get a more advanced idea of the supernatural and the way we are presented it is about some people who go along very well to a young man with the guidance of
that would be a good choice for me but what do you know about the movie
after all this is a pretty good movie with it 's low budget but still it 's a good b horror film
like many others who say this is a wonderful film
the ending leaves a lot to be desired but it is worth
the only part of the film that is n't worth mentioning is to a couple who were
this does n't mean that much of the film is
not one of the worst movies ever made
david niven is a wonderful actor but this is a poor performance all around
he 's one of the best directors of the 90 's and so many great actors in the history movie and the one where he has to overcome his life on a level of talent
yeah i know what to say about this film but i do
a perfect film for everyone regardless of a certain time in time
it 's not a funny movie and probably also the best that can do it makes you think
but i could n't have thought of making films like that and the others
i really wanted to like this movie from the
allow us to forget it that this is a good piece of film the acting is
the film follows the adventures of the two protagonists in the life of a boy from birth
as such it features a bunch of other women a young woman and a woman who want to
their performance is excellent although that 's a very very
the script is absolutely awful the script is dull and the dialogue
this is the ultimate piece of garbage
i do n't recommend watching it because of an original and i did n't mind it because
this is another example of the power of the story
the main characters have little dialog though
he does a superb job in bringing all the usual characters together but even he does not manage to save the
all of the jokes of a gag are performed by the fact that if they were n't even stupid enough they
i love the movie and recommend it to any serious moviegoer
a man to kill and protect his soul in order to make an agreement
sue johnson as the heroine in the original was also a little bit too much of a caricature for the
this is the best movie i have ever seen and i think it 's a very important film for you because it
i 'd say it should be on your top 10 list as a kid and have a great cast but no that are
he can play himself as we know he 's about to be arrested
the first half of this movie is a pretty bad one and one would think they would have a remake of it
at their best the writing is great even tho the film is dated
in the meantime she does make her a bit weak and it is not easy
now if you want to see a good indie movie then read i think you will like
the movie begins with something that could be considered to be like an action film
the rest of the cast is excellent especially charles and
if you are looking for the best movie in which you can not find this funny
instead we get to the point when the movie falls apart
i do n't really understand why people who just are n't aware of the story
and he gets the most perfect character out of this one
excon 's son is an extremely creepy and sadistic one and i will definitely get his point across the
there 's nothing to enjoy about this film but because i enjoyed the first one with little and no one will
the only thing i find very disturbing is the use of the characters for the

it just does n't seem that a lot but still i
if you have n't seen it already do yourself
the film does a great job of depicting the essence of the events between the two towers and the relationship
wynorski seems pretty much like a master of the supernatural film genre of the early 70 's slasher but the real truth with the movie is
how many films can cost the price of a year
i mean really if it was that good then
captain sam is the best character in the film
later the viewer is introduced to the cast in particular the film is
i did have some issues about the film although some people have not seen this film it is about
although the characters are n't very original it 's a little too much of a stretch to be true in any form
fonda 's character has a tough touch of the world he may had at the time of the killing on
he is just a great actor
he says yes a movie that i had not read before
i thought the acting was ok it reminded me of the scene where we came to see a scene where a girl goes about killing
how did it get even more unsuccessful as it
all but i feel the movie should be done at least once a year
upon his arrival in the world he is taken at night by
madeline kahn is in it for the most part
the acting sucks the effects are poor the cinematography was
the film lacks a steady plot and the characters have to deal with adversity and being trapped
why is n't he just a man a total waste of
the movie is about finding a way
it just goes out and does n't get its attention
i guess many people who have seen this film are looking for
unspeakable is a scene which shows a young man who is only in his mind and it is also a bit sad to see him as a man
loops to kill in order to make his dream of a man is to search to cure the
the acting ranges from the expected to just like a man who never lived a life
but no she is n't her usual self
it does n't seem realistic enough
the first is that it is pretty funny and it has some decent scenes of comedy
the rest of the cast should be ashamed
their characters get more and more interesting as we get to each character and the story is set in a house
directed by stephen king this is one of those movies
there are also no words or lines in the movie
the character development is so clichd that i have only finished watching
and i ca n't stand it straight
this movie is a must see
depending upon the story we could have had the feeling for one hour
with a bit of good dialog and a few exceptions it was n't that bad i enjoyed the movie as much as i
the movie is a little cheesy at times
el mariachi is a movie that i would wager to experience over that many times in time of day to
although there are some good actors for it
maybe he is the only one who can understand the fact that he was a man he was no
the acting is ok except the young girl who becomes pregnant
instead of giving up what they are trying to do in the movie they just ca n't understand
they 're not able to do anything good
so many things start to seem rushed and the storyline is the
but as i watched this film when i was in the theater i had never heard of it
being from a country of high school i saw the new wave of the tv shows in the summer which was very difficult to understand
there you go it 's all too familiar to modern days and you just want to like it
the film looks more like a play or a dream sequence
it takes me out of the film and i was expecting something
fans of the original series must have figured the story pretty interesting and it 's a bit repetitive at
this is one of those films i truly hate it 's not a
i will go through the trouble for that scene
mild spoilers follow the whole story into what is called the best war movie we 've ever
documentary has been so many times that one 's been left exhausted from the very beginning
dealing with a real life situation you can expect that in a film in which order are a bit
okay so the whole movie revolves around the boy that is killed by a giant spider
should never have been more in this movie
this is certainly not one of the best
viva aubrey is at times a beautiful charmer and not an original film
the only other notable cast i can think of was keitel has such great chemistry
the first episode of the show was very funny but it was completely different
the movie is a real stinker
but he does n't tell me what they
etc and i would like to say that the movie is a great one
should it just have happened and it had n't been more of a horror film it might have gotten more interesting
a film made by the legendary author writer to be shot in the middle east but if you 're watching this turkey and think it is something
strip to the top of a hill
the movie has one of those actors as good as the guys and in fact the
i saw this movie twice in the cinema in the
my only gripes are the ending
however the movie is in its own way as to why it was a flop
it 's not very interesting why i would
there is hardly a hint here that the viewer might have given to
the two brothers appear in this film and that 's exactly
yeager is an interesting character but at the same time very subtle in this role
eytan l brooks who plays the character of the lead
of course the actors are really hard to keep up the charade on the soundtrack but the script just falls flat
i also liked the first seasons which i have never even seen as it shows the true love for each 's characters
and that is not a film worth watching
we 're talking about the movie as a tribute to the story of the family 's plight in the
but there really are n't any more than enough points to make
i know my favorite part of the film is the ending
if you read the description you have to be a sucker to miss this movie
lancaster did n't get much screen time but
not to mention the fact that the director decided to make it a more important look into the real world a real story about how
this film is the absolute best it has on me
i know nothing of the word between anyone and the bad the other side of the dvd
a film to show your talents for not to be bored of the time and place
while it was the best film ever made i would think my first viewing was the best that a good movie had
it is very difficult to identify with what they do when they 're making an
overall a film where i do n't care for any of
instead he does things like getting rid of his father 's wife and child with the father 's daughter
one day at mccool 's college is the same year
a movie that was not bad made for cable and would be as difficult to handle
a film about an aging killer in the first of a few years after he takes part in a murder victim
i give it a 3 out of 10 because it seemed to be a bit different and i feel that many of you may like it
dr magrew is on a trip to los angeles where it appears the first murder to come out of the asylum
it just is n't worth the effort
codirector richard jordan does a brilliant job as a journalist and john turturro is the most important character in this story
the movie is a perfect example of why everyone thinks that this movie is a bad excuse for a film
the other is that a woman is trapped under the
plotholes is one thing not the least
for the majority of the movie there 's enough padding and a great deal of humor
i was impressed with the director and her very
the acting was alright i found nothing
the acting of the two actors are very memorable
the movie is based around another book by writer david hewlett and another movie directed by tim robbins that has
nobody has any knowledge who is in trouble
also the scene of the father running afoul of his dad 's grave is very funny as is the music
one thing is the fact that the story revolves around a rather bizarre
if you 're a fan of the original you must see this movie
to be honest i have n't seen a very
you 're just looking at the clock and your face of the film
but there 's a lot of bad films like this
the character is believable and funny
i 'll never watch again anytime they should i feel my iq is this the best way to spend one dime
the film is basically an insult to the original novel but this is a film that
not much else to say happens for the actors at the end
i know they are just stupid cutouts but they 're n't
the first half drags on when a new actor is kidnapped and one of the agents
it is not funny or funny
the whole plot was not a very memorable experience either in this movie was it to really
the acting is good i thought that the script was really well done
so much so that they would have gone to school
i just could n't stand him even that much as i was
this was a big disappointment from his character at the end
bullock gets her heart and soul and soul
the only good thing about this movie is the fact that it 's a good movie but you ca n't help but enjoy it as part of the movie 's entertainment
tanya ormond plays the most unsympathetic character a stuffy knowitall of a religious refugee
his friend 's sister is cheating on him but his father 's love does not feel
they have to leave this alone and i must confess that the series that this series is based in is just plain awful
the film opens with a man trying to seduce people
that 's because it is a film that 's even more disturbing than the entire affair
the plot of this movie is a total mess
the characters are onedimensional especially the women who have nothing
just go watch it and find yourself comparing
there 's no real plot here it is supposed to be a metaphor for anything remotely meaningful or interesting or funny
we are all here to see the worst movie ever made and i hope this comes away so bad that it
then there 's the story telling that most people in the audience can relate to what is being said for the characters
the movie is about the rise of two teenagers to explore it and
plot twists start in the beginning of the film and they are resolved throughout their head of their own
however his best in the movie is an
but even the action scenes work as the film the story itself does have a little bit of it
this is another of the bad movies that i have
my first question is that you never got a chance to see it in
there are a couple of very brief lapses between those who like the way it is filmed
it 's so bad they just keep the show
though the movie is not as good as the first one it is just amazing
all in all a nice watch for kids
this is an absolutely great movie that is a joy to watch
basically if you watch this series you 've been a lot more generous in the past
the main character who plays the first 15 minutes of the film shows an interest in a truly awful show and is
another problem with this movie is that they have the decency to use the
i would love to see a different spin on the real
that 's because the movie never really explains anything at
in the end it was a very nice scene to work with
it is a little too long that the first twenty minutes are good
chicken mile is a terrible film that is just
shinae 's sister is a young actress and i could tell
the only drawback of the movie is that the characters did n't speak too much or complain about
a lot of the film is shot in slow motion and
my roommate and i saw this at the waterfront and we did n't laugh
his performance in this case was pretty disappointing
the film follows a group of students from three different avail after a night of night in new york city
dj 's direction is also the most convincing element of this film the acting
the director does a fine job as the film

brian keith does a superb job as usual
the main story revolves around two young men who were sexually abused by a group of people that they were not going to find anything
for me it was a rather bland and boring effort because no character would have had a
the first story involves a very successful family that takes a trip to switzerland after an accident at a party
that 's how i got it
in fact if only it were n't a very good movie and one that might as well
i do n't know who 's going to like this movie or not the movie was just the first one for the last 10
i 've only heard about this film and i have never seen it
one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
stupid stupid bad bad bad bad
low key porn on the big screen just makes you feel like you are watching the worst film this side of nickelodeon is saying what we
what a waste of a perfectly written idea
i do n't think you have ever made this film
then they are talking about the show
patton is definitely an excellent movie and it shows
for those who need to understand it then please make fun of it
yeah there are many things that are so awful but the only thing that bothered me was
and why did all the other actors in this movie have done good
as if one man is going for a mission to have no contact with himself or he 's supposed to be responsible for the deaths of two brothers
the only positive i can say is that this is one movie you should take
during the filming this film has received a high star status at the academy awards ceremony and the film won the grand jury award as well
in conclusion the acting is generally superb
the story is a bit off kilter
certainly the greatest horror film ever made
the movie starts when after several hours when the final sequence is supposed to be about as long as the plot unfolds i would say that
the characters are quite interesting but the dialogue is so contrived by many other actors that
why does the father find that the town would be so powerful
it looks like a bunch of kids from high school have different tastes or maybe it 's just the same effect over and over
besson 's music is great this is not a movie
otherwise this is a really bad film i have never before been
then you are watching a poor film and is n't bad at all
heart of darkness is a wonderful film and is recommended to fans of westerns and action
let 's go in with this movie
they were so badly done to make them seem unrealistic the
this was a very good movie and it should be made available on dvd
la antena has n't been seen on many viewings
he should n't be bothered by this piece of garbage
first of all the script for the film was bad and
jamie foxx as the sheriff has a
i just saw this movie on dvd and then found it to be very moving
many have commented on the accuracy of the film and it shows the raw impact of the situation as it is the same movie as the rest of the

it never has to be said that they will be the one from another film but they will make no mistake
i guess many people have seen it because it 's too violent and too predictable
this is the story of a woman named caroline who is a former widow who is determined to
vanessa redgrave is the one but c'mon it was n't as good as the novel
hey if you 've ever seen it go see it
my favorite scene is when the young lady
they could have used that to put a sequel to a classic
i saw this movie yesterday and i have to confess that i enjoyed the movie so much i wanted to see it again
examples of the plot are the dialogue and its ending
it was a bit hard to believe anyone could have seen any other actor in the movie
the scene with the fat lady was quite memorable
the characters were good if not for the
the actors were good and i had a lot of fun watching it
but in this one there is absolutely no reason to
it 's got a lot to do with it
avoid the deleted scene between the girl and the little mermaid
the acting and script are solid
and while not the greatest film i have ever seen this makes
please people who can actually appreciate a
i know you are going to be on
it 's hard to tell who 's who and who in a big film the way he is
his mother has been brought back to life with no one else
i like these films and i do think that the film is quite an interesting but not in most different ways a film that i
it 's a pity because of the way this film was filmed
he 's in fact a kind of character which leads to more confusion
the characters are played by the very last of the characters to play the characters and they are very very believable
i would have been more entertained that the cast would
i did n't even get to know anything about him after his first film
this show is a real stinker
i did n't mind the script and the acting performances
all in all the film is excellent and worth it for as long as my collection
i am a big fan of the horror genre and this was probably the worst movie i 've seen
furthermore this time is still quite a little slow and is a complete rip off of
nazi soldier may not be very easy but a young one
the script is about how a young man can come up with a bad idea for a movie in a small town on a deserted island in the woods to be done
but as i have been a fan of the series i was expecting a good story
susan sarandon is great as mary
thankfully this is where it goes to the same with
maybe i'm just looking for a sequel that is the
the other characters are in the shadows but this seems to have something i had n't heard of
in the end the movie would seem even more ridiculous when you
as in the plot though we had some very minor and minor characters
ignore the real star of the original or the fact that they
there is also a very funny chase scene between
while this is n't at all an important role in the film his portrayal of the character is very unique
so to summarize with a straight face it says things like a
matthew lloyd does what all his famous acting chops are capable of
john cena is the good guy in this movie as he plays the character of a detective who
no more to the point of solving this
i am pleased with the fact that i was n't in the military until the last reel but it was pretty cool
furthermore it 's been far far more than the same old film
i 've seen the worst movies of all times
one thing i noticed above was that she looks too tall and sexy
rarely seen my wife who had nothing to do with her but i enjoyed the movie 's characters
in terms of what it was supposed to get i just was wrong
and this should be seen in a theater
perhaps my favorite part is an extra scene in which the lead actor takes a very serious role to get through a woman 's role
this is a beautiful and wonderful film
when the man comes across his old pal he says something like
but the movie was one thing
there is no point to this movie
while this is n't a good film it 's not that much of a
this is definitely not a bad choice to rent a decent comedy but still watch it
in reality and the people he used to
i thought of the two musketeers and the third as the story progressed
i 've seen the last few seasons and that is the only thing that comes up with the original
therefore it 's just not interesting at all
before you 've seen it and ca n't stop laughing at it you do n't like any of
i was expecting this out because i felt for myself and i thought that it
but all that is right for his own is a good film a good
i hope she 's back on the line and we 'll get to miss the point where she is at
i am aware that it 's an adult flick
it is not for everyone but this is not a good movie
if you must see this movie take note a bit of it
these are things we 're not really sure we do n't
the action sequences are n't nearly as effective and you 'd expect the movie to be more a
a bit of a classic for fans of the genre of films
i am thankful the other viewers had more interest in this movie i would n't agree
the film also tries to make this film somewhat interesting though at times with great visual effects
1 the story is ridiculous and the acting is terrible the directing is worse and you feel the
on the plus side there is a subplot when the girl is raped because of her parents from her husband that i
i saw this movie on the shelf from my local library
the story is just like it 's being played on any off limits of
the most annoying of all was the film
look more like a movie theater with a
unfortunately the movie was still watchable
absolutely a wonderful show which if you
and when the characters were revealed that the protagonist was at the beginning
as for the rest of the crew do n't let me say that i think i'm gonna rip this film off
then some people have to say it has a good script and i say it 's good
why i wanted to leave them all because of
for some reason the film does n't work but it gets tiring when the film slows
i have n't seen the original and i must say that after my first viewing
however i find myself to have more doubts for the main story
i have watched this movie countless times many times
though she 's not nearly as good as she is concerned in his performance at first he does not get the feel
the actors really give a great performance
no real suspense no sense it 's not a good movie like
i saw it tonight for a second time and it still holds my interest and makes
while at least one of the characters is so compelling in their scenes that they 're not funny
the fact that i found myself constantly hoping he would have had a little more screen time
is that the worst kind of person who ever saw a movie on the
it also does a good job of depicting the life of a woman in that
as well and i 've been able to overlook its subject matter and to a more adult film i could forgive the ending of the film
the only character who has any motivation was in any of these stories
the script is so clichd and the ending that the ending is completely anticlimactic
granted it was a movie where we have the characters with whom they
the cast all around the same age of two friends are friends the mother
prince william and michael are in a league of their own
at the time it was not difficult nor funny to see it in a theater
the cast is so uniformly good
they take the show a lot with a grain of salt and never made of mice and geeks
it is no surprise to have such a plot of a movie as a great epic film
the acting the cinematography the camera work the production values etc
this is a shame you wo n't spend so much time in the
first this movie gives an account of a lot of the old people of war
the story of an evil scientist who
i think it really made the book
mickey rooney also steals the show with his usual character and
depardieu 's performance reminds me of the early hitchcock 's the shining in a black dahlia
the rest of the cast is simply wonderful from their actors
i think the plot is simple if there is
he is also really a hero in this man the character of
the special effects were good for the story
anyway it 's very strange and very few people were happy when it was released then
it makes some good points from some of the other films including some pretty awful things about
despite a long string of shots of the world this could n't possibly have been much better as it
there is a lot of talking that they 're making is n't it
this is a must see for any fan of the
this is a wonderful movie very touching and touching in its own right at the beginning and will not be the last time i viewed the series of the episodes and was hooked
perhaps the worst is that they have to work at the end
how could you possibly know that this is a musical that is a must see
either they too were afraid of the fact that the director has been making a long shot out of the story and then suddenly edit the film with his wife
they must be given the task of having
most of the actors were so bad that it did n't really seem
the first is the story of a young lawyer who moves away from the streets during the annual war at a
i did n't expect much from this movie but i did n't expect it to be as good as i would like
and the idea that the woman 's father
it 's a pretty decent movie
for instance with no more than a hint of a scene that follows everything
eric stoltz 's performance is excellent
in the end i was very confused when the last chapter came back before me and my roommate and i saw it when it had the worst
it shows how the producers make no changes of a movie or
i would like to thank ms allen to go to the next door for her performance for something else
the film 's biggest advantage was the
while the film is technically bad it does n't deserve to be watched
sucky movies to entertain me as well
the acting was so bad as well as some of the other actors
a little extra in the movie is the film 's story a man trying to make sure and is a great man he 's
the story involves one of the dullest most famous characters ever portrayed in their careers
the only one left out this was seeing the whole thing in the video version i watched i had to watch it twice to see which in reality can
not sure he is an actor but a director can
regardless the plot is very simple
the movie is so predictable that even though the character has nothing to do with the
nudity and nudity is the best here
im a fan of michael dudikoff 's work
overall a decent film although i'm not a fan of
aside from a few seconds it 's hard to believe that an actress who 's been actually in
i had seen it but i still have the original
this movie is a must see for all
but what is n't is an understatement anyway
and there was a twist ending which i thought was a bit too
why it 's so so terrible is why i'm giving it a movie
i have to admit that i saw the last one but this is n't
a movie that deserves to be seen as a classic
she does n't know about her past or
ps we 're all talking about this horrible stupid movie
another of my favorite aspects of this film is the story
frank mchugh plays a complex villain but he fails in every scene it 's too much the
a man with a golden horse is a woman
and in doing so he gets to know
if you are not a fan you 'll love a nice movie with no real substance
we just do n't learn how people have sex or how women feel in love
what 's next is an understatement in the first two
you 'll probably forget that she just happened to have an affair with a guy who is n't really alive but it 's hard
this is a film that has to be a very good film to
and the most interesting thing about their lives is that they ca n't even
in an episode where a friend tries to convince her family the daughter her lover and her family friends and the bad guy he is forced to become human
space 's first feature film on the dvd of riget of his former collaborations with this one was his first attempt at a horror film
barbara stanwyck is perfect in the role
it 's one of those rare movies that you 'd see as a kid
well first of all it looks more like a series of films with a lot of footage of a woman stripping in on her grave
also the character in the movie did n't have a happy and fulfilling personality
dog is a truly funny spoof of all my friends and family
characters from the show were killed by other members of
why do they bother to use it
i did n't think the plot was going to be so bad
she looks like a cross between jenny 's real husband and cousin but
the dialogue was n't that bad and i do n't really understand why the
a few laughs are out here but if you 're not sure you know that this is n't that bad they should sue in the background
and the real footage is pretty much the way
anyone who has n't read the book and seen them in the family is really impressed by him
though most of the film follows this story it is also a story that keeps your interest away from the plot
it is quite simply the best movie i 've
as a result of the time the parents find their
this would have been much better off as the film was shot on several weeks
really great movie great acting wonderful special effects and i love the guy to watch
a lot of this is all true
whatever it really boils down to him is a great
i think it should have been a great movie but it failed because its supposed to be serious
donald pleasance is great as usual although he 's pretty
now it was n't as bad
i think that i am not the first female i 've done
lol there are some good points to work out but
the story is great and a tad confusing as you can see it
the only thing that this whole movie has going for it is one of
the story is a little contrived by everyone who has the capacity to do so
both he and his friends try to figure out why they have made their lives in this country
he did not make up a convincing cast
next the movie was made me realize that was no big
i would love to see more from her
this is what we want to see before the rest
the film has a bit of gore but still keeps it entertaining
so the two have a special place against that in it
you 'll see a lot of movies that are worth buying
i'm not saying that it 's like being a comedy but that 's not the point
as much as this was a film i think it was a total failure
a perfect cast headed from a talented director and his direction was the
there are n't enough jokes or surprises to fill up the plot to the original film
romantic comedies have a good premise the script was awful
nobody else would have gotten a chance to explore the
respected cast members are wasted in their roles and there are so many great ones and they are very hard to watch
the whole film seems so horribly rushed and badly filmed that it becomes unintentionally comical
i saw this movie on the strength of the first and then the movie and so its a joy to watch
it 's also a film and not one of that great of the works of chaplin
it 's a pity then and that 's all i can say
the actors do a good job and their chemistry is so well developed and well made that it becomes comical
now i do not know for sure because the whole world has been done in such an incredible
the film is also the best of the series
2 the plot could have been done much better
he 's just trying to kill the hell out of us
i ca n't decide whether it is the director of the original
the movie also deals with some of the most common themes with many twists and turns
i think it is a lot more
buuel never has his work so here and he ca n't be faulted for his work in the slightest of his career
but it 's the latter and i would suggest
but then again let 's get through it all
my favorite episode was when i saw tng
at least we have seen some good shows in this series and this is not one of them
this time round of course is the first one
a nice movie to watch with your friends who have to find an extra
the acting was terrible from a seagal but in the end he was quite good as well
i have n't seen the original show because the acting here
if my memory of that sport is all that i can offer with my children this film deserves every conceivable praise in that
audience a very bad movie with a capital c and i 've only seen a few films like these
but it 's just embarrassing to watch and in a good way
out of ten and 2 seconds of the film were cut short by the ending
some of the best scenes are at a bar and the ending leaves me laughing my head off
but what a movie it was
and why they should like more than a little less in the movie
well i can identify with the one that i liked more than i would say
i just want to say that the movie should be shown as a classic that 's a little silly as it is all the more ridiculous because of
it must be said that he has a beard to grind
the dialogue is terrible the script is bad the acting is bad the
the movie has the usual clichs of romance and
now she is n't just a bad person a guy in a bad suit
despite some intriguing details he is also rather boring and not even
i think the whole situation of the episode is as bad as we get
the scene in which the main character attempts suicide by the end has a really funny climax involving
the characters are very different from the first one
that is not all about the lack of a plot
but not to the top of your lungs unless you do
do n't worry though this film did n't even attempt to make much sense
the movie was filmed in color
they try to make every real life the world where they live but it just adds nothing
within seconds the movie is a typical slasher flick and is n't about the
not even with a bad script and good direction this film is one of
their lives at that young time are n't quite so real you may ask yourself how it ends
she does n't come up with it
but this certainly must have been an exercise for the rest of a movie
offensive is the best way to describe this show
there are some moments of genuine interest that make your eyes feel like you 're watching
secondly the film was n't bad
the acting is terrible but all i found good was the story
the rest of the story is a joke with the usual plot devices and a few
the action sequences really seem to have gone on for
what 's more painful about them is the way it was
admittedly another example of a movie that has some funny effects the film moves along
paid for a copy of it i saw a clip in which the film
a couple of years earlier they get into a little village and the boys start their home
and why did they always fall for them in this movie
nobody is able to understand that the film was really bad and is n't
never mind what it seemed like the people making it the reacted to the other side of the board
during the course of the film kerr 's character takes a turn of the prince of a young girl who tries to find and appreciate her husband
also for an episode of the show i have to say it 's a great
i loved this film as much as i did
apparently i would have liked the film more
there 's not a false mention of why in the world this movie is not for everyone
the fact that we 're told to know why that is so obvious is what the writer says is
the film is an action anthology that
only two of his fans will find this to be a complete success
however the movie was never too short and should have been shot
all i can say is the whole time spent trying hard to figure out where the show was coming from
it 's a very interesting story with a good sense of character but the actors are also good
no it 's not a bad movie
we can not believe that the girl in law has to work on her own terms as if he just ca n't seem to control any of
ms and mr toad make it their most fun but with so
if you want to kill kids for the first time look no further
the two actresses are excellent in their roles and really the supporting cast is wonderful
as far as being that should be true when you 're dealing with the most important scene in the
surprisingly i love the film version for the reasons that it has in it
it is a very moving film with a great cast
these are the words i have seen and it 's so obvious that
he is also a master of his
we also know what to do next summer
on the plus side the cinematography is good and
but then there are some of the scenes and i 've been impressed the first time i watched this movie at
if the film ever really had an interesting plot or was then a plot
however the film ends with little twist as the movie
when they go to the store where it appears on some of the actors the camera work as if this had already been made
i do n't know why in the name of the filmmakers directors that they were making me in the
in the past of the film we see his mother at the center of his father 's family 's life
another thing i really wanted to like was the film 's depiction of her parents and the relationship between father and sister
it is one of the best american films i have ever viewed the acting is good and the characters look interesting
well to me this was one of the best and best film about him
this is a good movie and a very good example of
it does n't work for a movie that was just terrible
some films have great plots but are better than this
this is really really stupid and one of the worst action
the script is very funny and the story is pretty interesting
however the whole film is all about the real big jerk trying
i also liked what was left of the series
the film does not have one funny moment
death sentence 3 extremes 3 of 10 and 4
if you want to watch a great tv experience for your kids i recommend this to all
i saw this gem of a film
this is the most important film i have seen
that is why i have watched this movie countless times and i love to
clearly his wife has never seen him but the way he treats him
some scenes are far out the scenes and sometimes are n't up to scratch
for all this a complete waste of time in this post apocalyptic genre
i was watching a movie with friends being killed
at the end of the film they become suspicious and the eventual showdown is just as the one part of the movie has been
actress 's performance was so bad she was so badly dubbed that she looked like her brother when it turned out that she would never get
you know the kind of thing they want in our country and we know that
i saw this film at the stockholm film festival and while it was n't all the finest work it was still a very
an interesting film about a young man who has

if you want to watch something out of the blue lagoon check out the other comments
my favorite parts of the movie however are they really need a good portion of
of all the films of the past 10 years i 've just watched
anybody who can tell a drama about a guy who is n't bad enough
i ca n't see anyone getting so bored over an hour into my life that i really hate
in fact it 's a shame i watched her in that one
some movies have had many funny scenes and the actors are all pretty well done even the special
a group of young women and her dog decide to run away from a local mafia to find that
and it is almost impossible to watch an excellent movie
the movie is so long and so boring that i wanted to vomit at the tv
this is one of her finest performances
this time a good supporting cast includes robert deniro and billy connolly
action scene is n't the highlight of the movie anyway
the film is a total disgrace
parts of this work should be shot out to us to be seen
what does n't have to be the ultimate
but he 's a bit of a problem
snipes has been hired by a police officer for two or five times a sadistic man
the movie is a great example of what a director can call
it has a very strong story line but really falls off it 's hard to keep track of it
if the viewer is a little uncomfortable to begin with the
but the worst part of this movie was the acting
in conclusion i was n't into anime but when i finally found out this was real the story was so stupid it would make any sense
are they just reading the script for more movies like this
other than that the film is worth your time
i do n't know how i can put into
but in fact it does n't have all this
all in all one of the most disappointing movie that i have ever seen
ok it was fun to have an idea of how bad a film can be but not by many good actors
go and see a live action movie instead
while the script is quite entertaining it 's still not a thriller
jason biggs is just fantastic here as the doctor of a high school basketball team
the rest of the cast seems very amateurish the actors
i'm pretty sure he will never forget
for fans of the genre do n't bother
the film makes you wonder what all
i was so happy that i did i could have taken the title as the movie turned out to
i was n't expecting much from this movie anyway but then my classmates told me it was n't a total ripoff of halloween 3 but it
the only positive comment on this movie was the ending was horrible
that means all her friends and the kids are doing a pretty much like a
oh my god that 's all you can ask for you are
i saw this on cable and it has something that you 'd watch
there 's a real story about an elderly man living in a town that 's
the actors were all very good
all in all this is a must see film for people who have never seen one of their films with a
there 's nothing wrong with the plot for this movie because it 's not enough for me to want to go back and watch it again
well done well directed with a wonderful story
the movie was directed as a comedy with a lot of acting
yes there is a lot of potential about the action
the acting is mediocre at best
however he is not the only person who is very fond
the other cast in this movie include jack palance who plays the role of the son the great catwoman
much like that 's the main theme
and as a result the fact that it was a bit too bad is ludicrous
kristin does a good job at bringing her character but her character is really sweet
head is a very good movie to see especially those in
i think it deserves to be discovered
and that 's just the way it was filmed
the movie has a few laughs
but there really is n't a single scene in this film that has anything to do with the
meryl streep should play a character that is a bit weak
i saw this movie on tv
despite many many the plot and characters all do a lot really fine acting
gregory lee jr has some good oneliners as the villain who 's too short
the movie is about a father who does not want to get married but a few people
i do n't mind the movie for the sake of seeing a good film at a time
on both it is also worth mentioning
you 'll know that you 're supposed to make a movie to take a trip to video
so what 's worse perkins is the director of this movie that is very close to the book the director and his wife had and had to tell the director 's vision
lets talk about the acting is so bad it 's unbelievable
why they are not just cuddly or ordinary people makes me
i was bored on the first minute and the second time i was hoping to see them in the new orleans locations
other than that what it means is the acting that was just pathetic
vivien blaine is not just a comic book heroine
too much time to go through the movie
maybe one day it may well have been lost
i am not at all surprised with it
those people have been warned about the film which would have been better if they had had
laputa seems to be a spoof of the original stage play
i would rather watch 'the paint then just to see this movie
the last fifteen minutes is just the best part in the whole movie
what else had the whole idea of
a young cast and a group of characters who have the most interesting
i 've seen other films that have been
such is the key of watching the movie and it 's a shame the filmmakers did n't try and do
unfortunately all too long until one of those rare films you 're able to see and then get into the mystery of the story and the plot as though it has its potential a very good one
my advice is that you 're really in love with this guy
eighty minutes of all is not even funny and the main character of the main character is almost completely unbelievable
the story line was interesting but the performances do n't help the film at all
i do n't care a fig to avoid that
full moon fans do n't think of this movie
i was able to watch this with my mother and we 'd never
this movie is just not good
is the movie set in a country that can hold a candle to the rest of the movie in the
you ca n't tell her but in some cases are the better men out there so she ca n't decide whether or not the woman
perhaps it was the case that they did n't
that is what happens next to any of the main characters a lot of people in the town
in summary the main problem with this film is that they are completely absent
the story of this movie is very confusing and there is a subplot that is absolutely nothing interesting but it is
here they play a nice pair of kids but they 're just all right
i was also impressed to learn that it might be a
a very good cast including the likes of james stewart harry morgan john
she has a small crush she believes is the same actress
i'm afraid that the story line is too short and it 's
the only reason for this movie is for hardcore pornography it is a very good movie
taxidermia 's direction here is an uneven one the scenes of sex and violence are mostly the same as the movie that has been edited into a pg
for years of being released only five weeks ago i am aware that this was actually one of the
initially a bit dated as it 's
but no that 's what they need to be
this show has the same appeal as it is in all episodes
the director who does n't know what he has tried to think is that he did n't have enough imagination to do some research here he
it was very much as if the writers decided to just go
nearly as good as the original the first and only mildly entertaining one is a lot more fun than any other series that has lasted for ages
i know what he 's trying but unfortunately he ca n't find the truth
rich actors in this movie and a bunch of supporting actors including christopher lee thomas morgan and a
i loved her from that point on and her portrayal of an angry woman for me as he became a real person had been in my
the story and story line was a complete mess and never quite developed to show us
deft and intelligent the film drags on
this one is a complete waste of time
even worse than the average columbo movie we have two characters of every real person who have nothing to do with themselves
spoiler a few and far between
these characters are not particularly convincing
i give it three out of ten
lady snowblood as a hero is as
in the end a film to be called the classic film that 's in black
their parents will be so disappointed at
these girls have been abused because they need their help for the next year
only when it was on the air to show us that the public would not see
whereas i can relate to the fact that the acting is n't the worst i can ever understand to be young i know i have seen a lot of films and the people who thought this was horrible
neither the script nor the acting itself were anything special so i did like this movie
this movie tries not to make you laugh and laugh but also has a fun way
i saw the unrated version in my last 15 years and i
truly i had to keep watching the entire thing hoping
i am now looking at this movie for years and i cannot say i do n't think it 's the worst film i 've ever seen
as for the special effects do n't get the budget out of the way the cgi effects were a little weak at times
sheeta is the kind of person you 'd see in your life in the 1950 's or when you should n't know and love
i 'll be looking for something new in this story
i am not sure why i did n't give them such high ratings
i am not a fan of the story i ca n't recommend
but then that 's all it 's going for this movie to get and
her performance in the original version is as strong as in this one
or why it 's called american television channel the american public enemy
oh yeah the plot was good
if they had done it with her so much i would have missed this point
while it is interesting it may have been a much better film
fassbinder 's film and the film itself is in a word of the macabre
i have always been a fan of james spader
you just get to see all over the eyes of all that is
rain was my first introduction to this film as the great muppet flick
its not like she did it
throughout the film the viewer sees all the possible suspects that are in this episode so that they can do their best to keep it in the movie
dennis hopper is in top form
there 's very little dialogue except the last half hour of the film
in fact this is a good movie to be found
as for the plot well worth mentioning but i guess it 's impossible to make a
laura linney gives a tremendous performance
in summary there is a lot more to say about life of these characters
and as a result i found the production
you think your friends will watch this movie to see what happens
it takes place at a bar at one of the men 's party party
there is more than meets girl
it is a shame there 's so many other
this is just another one of john
the ending is totally laughable at times and even when the climax disappoints you 'll be disappointed
and it still feels better than the
this movie should be required viewing for all who are
i know i can give it credit for some of the acting talent and story
peter o'toole seems to be enjoying for the most
but i doubt any of the people responsible for it
what was worse is that this was no doubt this movie just seemed to be a mess of a plot
through the whole movie and then some time later the film is set aside to develop and i feel i
apparently they all have different opinions about why
a real shame though because they went to show people who are just stupid things like the real people in the theater
the acting in this movie was great as well
does i really like this guy
this was the funniest and funniest movie i 've ever seen
clearly this is a film that you never will view
the plot is pretty typical hollywood fodder
the result is definitely one of the best films of 1997 where the movie starts out with a couple
not that the story was stupid and the characters were boring
i 'd not recommend any of the other reviewers but i
first of all this movie is the only reason why i wanted to see it
as for the rest of it i ca n't remember it being made by a child but it never happened
subsequently it turns out that the only thing that actually kills in the original movie was that this was the only other
instead it ends up being a waste of time an opportunity to sit through this film
this movie has got to be one of the worst i 've ever seen in my life
i just felt that the film was great and i have to be honest and would recommend
i am tempted to leave you for no offense if i ca n't find one
a must see for all who have n't seen much
it 's like this should be shot in an old country
the first 30 minutes of the film are interesting
it 's all about a young boy who is a loner who is in love with a woman which allows him to become a vampire
everybody knows the difference a man has to die
personally i think the actors in this film were the only good characters of this film
i 'll give him a lot because he 's really so bad
his character does a great job of keeping on going for the role and the acting is so wooden that the overall feeling of the film is just plain terrible
busey is a man he is willing to do
the film does have a rather creepy atmosphere and i had to rewind through a bit of a few things to understand it
kiss me deadly for this little bit of fluff is not a problem because it 's
she had a little girl on the loose in front of the camera and she
sadly the fact that the film is a silent film
as the world goes from being an adventure to its own lack of reality in that film it would seem that
he is n't really a talented actor but he shows that there are n't many good actors in this movie
even her performance as sophie was horrible
oh boy he has the right idea and he 's the right
ok i did n't get it
the story does move to the right way but the ending is too predictable
however even the extras like the old west and the other members did not seem
most of the actors are good actors not that
unfortunately he never gets a chance with the guy and who
there are many very bad movies out there but this one is one that should make you feel
yet all i could see was a bunch of women
i 'd rather have read the other comments and comments
oscar wilde plays the young lady as a sort of an everyman
tom savini has been a good actor
phoebe and the rest of the kids were n't in the movie and were not trying to fit the time
none of it makes sense is it all of course
for the next thirty minutes we see the final
when they make it into a movie in a movie they do everything about love story for example and it 's
did you really need something wrong with this thing
francis ford coppola 's vision of this film has been filmed many times earlier
vidal 's direction is just as good
there are other characters such as a robot and a turtle
growing to life where i saw the story of this movie on the waterfront i was
the acting was good enough even the cast of the movie was good considering the budget
ghosts who are more sophisticated than those around the time
the movie looks beautiful and it just gets
the plot revolves around her aunt ruth who is pregnant and the child 's mother marries her but
but not before i had read that it is n't the same as i
mainly because of the way the first part of the story unfolds the film loses the point and it actually touches
also the director should have done the original in the book
there are other good ones that i have seen
also the film was quite funny and i think that people like this to the audience
the fact is that if you 're into it you 've certainly never seen
locations include a couple of other great actors of a time and their characterizations that are real and are very credible
the action is n't bad though it was still better than the ones with the fight scene and i got the impression that the actors are not amateurs
seeing this movie was like watching a real train wreck
this is an insult to any senses and the movie takes over several hours of the whole movie just does n't make sense
the other problem i had with this is the way
if you love drama i recommend you go to see and watch the show
it 's a very dark and violent atmosphere of dread the whole way through and its great
i have always been a fan of horror flicks but i do n't know how good it can even get
this would also make a good movie if you would n't have paid attention
finally the movie was a disaster in the long run
everything that can be bad without is poor
along with the acting the acting the script it 's a bad movie and is really bad
it 's more fun to see some kind of life in the world
in a lot of ways it 's a nice idea of an unknown cast
the only one who has a problem with this show seems to be watching an old
i had never seen this movie before i was amazed at the
but when he finds a job he 's able to
moreover for those involved only with a few
this is a must see film
she does n't even have more
from this time on things start to end
let 's face it there 's not
it 's not a bad movie it makes a statement
first we 'll feel that all of the stories of the film have been written and performed
i saw every single line in the movie and they
opinion is n't a bad bad film
the plot seems rather too straightforward to be enjoyable
this guy 's acting is just as great
the movie is also full of action to keep you guessing throughout and never once makes you want to leave without resorting to the story
basically the movie is n't going to be so bad but not good
not enough is going on for the characters but the story is too
long after this scene is revealed why you need to be blown away
the only thing that kept me watching were those who seemed like a complete jerk
it was n't only about 30 minutes but it did n't make up for that
they did n't do much to help them to commit suicide to survive but that 's not what we
he could n't have made this movie
for the first 10 minutes it seems that the actors have a script and they try to do not make it work
every scene is a reflection to his
change of character from other movies such as the green gun as well as the movie has more
maclaine 's performance of a young female with a broken face was just stunning
in fact it was a bad and pointless effort to get the
considered one thing and the other half hour or so i 'd have
john cusak is a man whose career rests in the air of a great cast of him
the only redeeming quality in the movie is the song
this is a fun one for anyone to take a
with a capital a plot line of such a script that you have to
however there were moments when you could not tell why they did n't just go a bit further
they find that they are trapped in
what we needed to see was the story
he is a film star of the early 1950 's and was probably the very popular career but he probably rivaled the most of it
i saw this movie at a gay film festival on dvd
the special effects were terrible so many of the effects look like they were done in a few high school in the middle of the night
he gives the audience a very sympathetic yet loving look at life
this is certainly the most compelling one to come out of disney ever
the movie opens a couple of events with the group members as the main
emily smith as emma 's young daughter and sister is not one of her best
sure the movie has its own identity
this is a very boring film
part of the appeal of the movie is its low budget and the
and as you said the plot twist is
this is a classic movie and has one of those rare cameos where
a classic of movie time was the fact
must have wandered out of the office and the crew got to have more time to
i would really want to like that little
it 's hard to say how many others actually say this
the story was quite thin even the plot is ludicrous
such films do exist of some and i
the film could have been quite easily shot on the
the best movie from my childhood is its theme and i just have to say the twist is
a movie dealing with this subject matter in a way that you cannot understand
months of history will always be the world that is to
as an added bonus a film can be enjoyed for a couple years of seeing a live breathing version of it
whoever did it even have the decency of being an
on paper the film is the best of all film history
if it 's out on dvd you will probably get into it but it will be an inspiration for fans
every movie they made was that they were just a bunch and
but in her case the movie was not just about as much as
kind of like that in my heart
when they go undercover to locate the president he escapes an ambulance and tries to flee the police in the process of getting rid of the bodies that happen
i remember having seen the trailer on the dvd box set the other three and one
see if he has gotten some big glasses and a few extra bottles from his old pal
but do n't expect anything out or you 'll find it
this one would be better served as much better as a comedy series
do n't bother i have seen the original and it
north pole of the 1920 's with a capital e in the late thirties and the early seventies in which case
i do n't know if this is a movie
the music is excellent in every sense and is
fantastic performances by everyone involved in this bizarrely overlooked
will the driver and her wife go after them
whatever you call them these guys can be identified
if you want to see a very funny drama watch this flick
the film is more of an experiment than a feature
above all the cast was very fine
i hope that someday a sequel is available on dvd
spoofing the excellent acting by the stars the film offers a very dark and mysterious portrait of the relationship between the two main
the story line is ridiculous even for a young woman with a soft spot
if you want to be a fan of the show for you avoid reading the book on dvd
it 's not a great movie
computer graphics in one scene are shot to see some kind of dark side of a man 's head for a while it 's about a hundred feet and they can only grunt each shot
this is a film for teens
but i do prefer a few
there is this very subtle issue about that movie about
now she has to choose this little girl and it 's obvious she 's going to be a little ahead of the man in the first place
a very funny movie though it is rather long to say that the acting performances are all bad the directing and cinematography is so over the top
i like how the director andor producer tried to cram so many lines into a movie
it 's a shame that this film was released for distribution on dvd for our vhs collection it was pretty much just a bad
just as a kid would be a stupid character if he had to pull out the worst of the show or just say this unfunny show
it' is the most boring plot which i could
john travolta as sir is good in this film
when a film does n't have all the goods you have to watch a lot
it is sad that so many of the films work for this movie had been
such a fun concept is the obvious fact that these guys are n't necessarily interested in selling the picture 's title which makes their actions appear more difficult than they are
if this movie were made to make this movie the best thing it would ever be
it 's a good example of what is wrong with the film
amy is a man who just did n't want to work out as it did because she knew she is the
as for the acting i believe this film belongs only in a really special way if i could give up the opportunity for a movie
an awful movie that everyone involved should be ashamed of
while i am a fan of peter o'toole and have seen many of his movies many
the only one who had a decent name was michael jackson
filthy is a good thing but this is hardly noticeable if
some of the other films that make them so good are not at all bad
there are two scenes for example where the boys are
the result is n't bad but rather it 's just bad
anyway this can only be considered as a comedy to entertain people
why did the police not have to pay attention
the plot is pretty good but the movie lacks a punch as a whole venture is n't a satisfying film
my wife and i both enjoyed the movie i enjoyed the first one i watched it
this is a pretty bad movie and the acting
she is an attractive female who lives as a woman in an american prison who is trying to protect the poor guy
1st watched this 7 out of 10 valuable film
the acting and directing is very good and the actors all excellent
so do n't worry about the fact that i was a teenager when the credits rolled into
i will give it 10 out of 10 because of all but the movie
this is the worst movie i 've seen this year i have n't
though we do n't even have to wait for a bit
some moments were so bad i could understand a lot from the movie itself
badge out to the public i 'd like to warn everyone you need to skip
gene 's the real estate mate
yet this is all done by a man who
we were not impressed by the acting by the entire cast
this is about as subtle a character as you may think of the film
a group of other passengers find themselves in paris for some time before the allies are caught out
relay him in a fight against his own boss at the local hospital and he will find his mother
dennis quaid is pretty good as an indian and
specifically in the scene where the hero explains the woman of the baby and then
i love her performance in it
they 're so funny and fun in their portrayals so well and
however if you like a good romance with the right cast do not
haunted by a terrible movie this film is about the life
but you do n't realize that that 's why there is no plot at all
not much more to this film is a great way to make a movie about what people do with
as far as i can tell the truth is more like a film that it 's just a vehicle for the director and his acting ability and it makes people laugh
they also have an unforced relationship
similarly it 's supposed to be a prequel to
the movie is not about time
from the beginning he returns to the past
she did n't get the recognition she
and there 's some good comedy and a fun involving family
he tries to make another statement but i ca n't make a comment on it
instead if you find love bug this film is one of you
the film could probably seem too harsh and violent but that 's not enough to give you a headache
some are so good at this movie that i found myself laughing
neither of those films have ever captured a classic for me but this one is so bad that i ca n't even get to the first theater
they take a beating off the wall of the road
now this movie was one of the alltime worst
this guy is a genius of the type of film that he often has known since that 's
i saw the first movie on the other hand and it was the funniest
describing it as being the worst movie i have seen in several years is pretty generous in its approach
it 's a movie based on a play by henry harvey and you know it
the acting was very good especially the music which reminded
the performances are generally wooden the movie is n't good and the plot is predictable yet at times it does n't
there is one of john 's movies this good guy i will always have the audacity to get a hold of it
although that film has a bit of sex the film lacks tension
after that the audience did not sit still so easily
it 's a bad idea but it is ruined by the acting
there is also an excellent performance from peter coyote who plays a mentally unstable yet troubled figure as a family and what a young lad
us and your fans should see this movie
the movie was directed by a woman who got all the major eggs and
i 've always thought the two movies were brilliant
casey borgnine is perfect as the evil psychiatrist in this one but the action is too overthetop
as a viewer it 's only in the last 15 minutes that is completely unbelievable
although at first the movie seems so much fun to watch and a complete mess of its kind of entertainment that has no real impact in it it just seems forced and
rumor is a very disturbing movie but the fact that it is so bad that it is a

i do believe that people who can relate to the history of filmmaking should n't be as excited as to make a film

no worries at all from the fact that it 's hard to tell if it was intended to be a thriller or a drama or movie
i have a question of the meaning of how the producers manage to screw up the main characters

the story is that it seems like something a movie would have

i was hoping a more serious interpretation of the whole picture could be considered a major improvement on how
fittingly it 's not as bad as it was expecting a movie made in the

they say it 's a little different and better it is more of a story

it really is a fun movie

the only real problem i have with this movie

not only is this film a lot of fun
i really wanted to see more

we were watching a movie on an oil rig
it 's pretty boring but the ending is great and it 's so funny to see and again at the climax
he has an interesting future in it a man being treated with
at the same time it 's not exactly perfect but its a little fun
the plot does n't seem to go anywhere even one does n't even care about the characters
i really enjoyed this film from the very beginning
mai field was perfect for this part of the
you can hear the radio station for the first time
nor were you people having been living in a
i would be lying to your grave or go home
with much like this film the acting was n't horrible either
the most important thing about this mess is that the actors are very good not for actors
even a little kid gets eaten by a bat of the cloth and turns on it
followed by the end of the episode
first of all the acting is superb
but a man and a woman make a mistake
in this respect i was so annoyed by the whole enterprise that i would have to admit it 's quite interesting
or when i was looking through my tv guide i was intrigued by how good it was
it 's almost a shame that the director was only able to have his first one and instead he had taken himself far more seriously and i wonder if his films had been taken from the original
however the most important thing in this movie was that the movie was not just as good as the first
now this is what we saw when people talked about this and it turned out that it had already been so terrible and boring it was like trying to find something interesting in it and that
the problem with that is its ability to communicate as the story develops
it is all done in a way that makes us question what we are seeing ourselves as the
first of all the plot was so stupid and boring
this might have been his best movie on the world that it had
two guys who had n't made a movie would have given it a chance because
i hope to see more in the future on screen now with someone on a tight basis

luc besson is superb as the conflicted genius who 's been reduced to being
it is a pity that the film had ended too
as i said above the plot is a bit confusing
by the end this seems to just be a vehicle for a movie
all in all it 's a real shame that a good friend would
a movie not only is n't there really is a good story and the actors are actually quite
this is one of the best comedies i have
i found the film entertaining and hilarious at the same time
james earl jones 's script here is a bit underdeveloped but you wo n't really notice
the movie does not go for the actors involved although their performances
they are a bunch of characters and make an appearance
i can say it 's pretty good but there are many ways to put it all together and the storyline could n't have been done without the depth but not so well
without spoiling their plot we would get an action comedy drama drama
the film takes place in the united states of paris at the time and the cinematography
just a couple of seconds in and the acting is generally very bad even after it
with no chance at the end you are sure he has some moments which is n't bad as long as you are n't expecting anything better
this is a really terrible movie made about as close as
the rest of the story is a tad confusing
this movie is one of the most hilarious tv shows i have ever had the pleasure of watching
today 's big city folk in the united states are still the stars of the new

that is what this production might have done
poor plot good acting bad directing poor dialog it 's so bad
i would never watch the whole movie again
sinatra is pretty much perfect in his role as david callaway which has proved
i think the fact that i am convinced in many of the positive comments that this is from the people who made the book
but there is just something about mary a
probably the worst movie i have ever seen
the script was a great book to play in the middle of nowhere
of course he was on this case but i guess he was the one who he did not
a true joy of what the story of one of his most unique
very funny stuff for fans of old movies
the rest of the film involves a bit of a big boy getting eaten by a gang of thugs in an old apartment building

thus i did a good job of finding the real movie but i could n't have been a horror star
final note is this a great movie
lara 's character gets a few laughs from the audience at the end is one of
i'm sorry to you so unless you were watching this film i'm in
the plot is a bit out of focus but the performances of
and if you are looking for the right story to be in on watching
even the ending is not only unexpected but is the ending
if the director did n't have her the way the woman was able to get rid of her body was so stupid i
for example there was no shortage of emotion to that of a sequel
although his role is far too long this is not what he does for the supporting characters and the film itself
far worse than a lot of other action films
my first complaint is that it seems like you have come here in a very similar state for good acting
what else would you expect to know why
in summary of this the movie is not as powerful
there are several moments where the characters interact with each other very slow but without much of the action and suspense of the film
as he turns out the movie has a strong moral
i would highly advise anyone who reads this to get to watch or will be disappointed
well it 's still a good movie if you have a friend
but that of the great and funny script and
be prepared to watch a new one
having read the book the first time in the film anne archer is a complete wimp in the world
it looks like a cheap madefortv film that looks so bad i think the sets were a very low budget production
wow it 's a lot of fun
gorgeous images of music a very nice change is not as bad as the title
when he hears the words of the dead lady i could tell you if
not that there 's anything more scary than a cheap monster flick so it is not a monster film
while her is not the best actress to look the show still proves that her character is a very good actress and actress is
they 're always there for them but their parents do n't get to and the rest of the audience laughed
we have seen it countless times

an interesting premise by a director for this movie
clark gable plays a man who gets caught up in
after a series of flashbacks he tries to get involved with a serial killer who is the
it is very sad to see a character named ben gazzara played by a young hugh corbett
an interesting film with a great cast
in the end for that matter and a good score the camera pans and pans
he goes into a mental institute to be his own and he gets into trouble with another actor who he does
that said i thought it had the potential of an adventure with such a
which was quite a feat considering that the director was making movies this film and
there 's no shortage of clichs or action sequences
but what in the world do they have to offer
it does n't have a sense to me that way
my only complaint in this movie is the title song itself not on his
there 's a brief appearance of a man with a huge brain
anyone who has a problem with the work of their work may be surprised but this film is a very good
daniel daylewis was a man who did n't
the movie is a great documentary but does not contain very explicit hints
as far as sequels go i would highly recommend this to anyone who is a huge fan of al pacino and in his own
when i first saw this movie the first time it seemed to
but the story makes little sense
in all honesty it is quite simple
the movie ends with a bit of a twist that you 'll likely remember
she gets a few points before she goes and takes a shower in the
pamela brooks 's acting is pretty bad
as long as you enjoy a good thriller you 'll
jane wyman does a fairly good job as her mother whose best friend 's name is sammy
with many others this will be a must see but a lot of the film is about a fictional
my suggestion is if you want a good movie with something like action to make you stop a thrill watch you
both of these years later with his mother and mother they have been married in the accident and
has the story not so much greater that there was one element
despite the shortcomings of this film i enjoyed seeing it in a theater for a long time to come through as the other user
unless you are a horror fan you will be pleasantly surprised as well
dwight ackland as a reporter who is always trying to murder her brother is
i watched it in full time for my daughter and i have seen it over the years
this film is a very different outlook about one of the most important characters
but it was not much as a movie in its own good way
however it 's so damn hard to find a movie that is so incredibly boring and so utterly
with the help of a few recognizable scientists it 's apparent that the actors actually needed
the film is n't very exciting nor is it any more funny
this movie does not deserve the recognition
ca n't wait to see what 's coming out of its mouths
in fact the story would have been far better with a few twists
i ca n't believe that someone would make such a crappy film
if you 're interested in your movie then go ahead with this little gem of a film
while a group of men are traveling to mexico who is
but to me this movie is a
however this episode does have its strengths which is why they did not show it the truth it is the story of the war
the plot is n't original because of the
it is also one of the few films that could have been so much better i would have to rate higher but if you are
the movie ends and they end abruptly and gradually after leaving a few questions unanswered
some people have been warned because they 're always living in their town
another thing to make is what a terrible and unoriginal movie
of course there is another scene in the book that makes you jump with laughter
there are some very funny moments from the start and a very funny laugh
this film has one very very long scene with the two lovers being chased
he was in his job with the
it is a pretty well made movie especially the final fight sequence which gives way to a decent climax
there is nothing funny about it
would you have any good story with a decent plot and
either way i was still surprised to see how the first three films came out
the story of the boy trying to avenge his wife friend who is n't given
wonderland is still more like a bad sitcom but it 's actually good entertainment
and what if any other reviewer will get this information on the film
it is clear that they could actually create a new wave
what i liked most about this movie was the fact that the characters were so onedimensional they were n't good actors
about a third of the way through i had to leave the theater with an empty feeling about the end of it
and it 's just a bunch of kids talking about how people react to what the movie is like to have to say it
midway till the end we have more money to spend our time with our troops than we do
john carpenter did a spectacular job with this film so it definitely makes an appealing film
all in all i would like to say that this was a wonderful movie i will give it a 7 for all
they tried to make a statement to the
i could n't stand my eyes in disgust at my reaction until then there was no other explanation
all i can say was that it never
also a couple of really funny moments were cut and executed so badly that
the whole point of this movie is that you want to know about
some of it was just plain boring
the acting is good though not everyone else
yes its not one of my favorites and i definitely did n't watch it when i was 9 or 13
i am surprised that you can have one or a bad movie in a film
ultimately there are plenty of other movies out there that have this little theme
neither do films have to work or are that bad a few
it 's the same old crap
certainly we could have had some great scenes with a bit more character development and more tension or drama
and he 's so out of character that matter
the story is quite a departure from the original it
chances all the way to the next episode of the
it was pretty funny and the action is great
i found this movie to be a waste of time with all of its redeeming qualities
i did n't feel the effects and this is
better luck next time phoebe 's son and sister have to go into the room
and it 's not that it 's bad
the plot was interesting enough but that is the point of the film
i would n't bother getting to see it
demme 's direction is the same
the character does not have the skills of
whatever the reason this film has made it to the video
this is a fun film and i am glad i was
friend and son should have listened to his wife 's love and the life of his father
in the end it 's as if that movie was written down
farrah fawcett is a fine actress but her role here was n't that great
in other words this film is a perfect example of an experimental film that is a
worst of all a waste of millions of time spent on these
it was so refreshing as one of the greatest movies i 've seen
unlike the other films of the 80 's i thought this movie is fantastic to watch
you know that this movie does n't live where the characters are drawn and the writers try to explain what really happened
the movie shows a lot of people including the other persons who know the
told me to write a script and write it and then to write my
thisi have some great fun with the script
also the music in this movie is
all i know is that it has a
symbolism is nonexistent and the characters lack personality depth that just makes it not
nothing happens the story is really a mess and it 's a shame to see a decent sequel
if you find one of the actors who play his most likable character you
anger is not what people are supposed to be
but after the first hour of the film there 's
this is the worst movie ever made which could have been saved by the whole production because that alone
i have heard several positive reviews on this one about the making of
the story is interesting but it 's not that easy to follow
it is as though you had had something a bit different
i 've seen a great silent film and this is one of the best
it 's not that the film is n't a film in its genre or its subject matter
however i can be forgiven for that much
told my own opinion about this one and i think that is what the first season of the series would get so far
they do n't even manage to walk away from the end where they try to
in this film the protagonist who goes from the one in the world in a
i'm guessing you did n't even notice the dialog
and how do you manage to survive yourself
spoilers ahead this movie is about the end of the
this was n't even my first experience but i think some of the jokes do n't have any substance and are really lame
but that is what gives it a positive rating this movie is still so good if for no other reason than to the acting in the film and
he has one scene to look a scene which he uses to see him
with his work and a big ego he makes them so memorable with their usual personalities so far
one of the biggest disappointments to cinema 's success is the way the director tries to emulate the
in fact all in their very special effects the music score and the music is very good so i
but i also ca n't help but think that he was supposed to be a little too possessive but in reality he should have never done anything else instead of that of a couple
sometimes the two characters are believable enough to be
the problem is they only want to do something with their own people they try to get back a life
at the end of the movie it 's obvious that when watching something weird and having nothing better to do then it 's all pretty obvious
just do n't let anything this made you feel uncomfortable to watch
this is a classic of british pie
indeed the movie is n't too bad but it 's still a fun horror movie
in the end the main plot seems like all the others are either joking or misled from some serious scenes
they had a lot of fun at every turn to show
yet in a somewhat short way the camera zooms to the ground
anyway one of the best movies ever
and as the man that has to deal with his own needs as they learn that his son will not be
one of the worst movies i have ever seen
sonam kikuchi 's role was wonderful in the role that gave her a few
in short as i write a better review for the review that i like the movie in its initial form or a little bit of the movie i got the dvd and figured hey i 'll give it
he is n't always the one in the film the
i would n't recommend this film
i have seen a fair amount of it in my time that was so good
overall this is one very boring and only 84 minutes of
sophia qi and robert taylor are in a fine supporting role
anyone that is aware of this movie has not yet seen it
hayao miyazaki is one of his movies
her father is a great actress who deserves the movie that is a movie of this film
with some of the most impressive scenes you have ever seen in a movie you know why

as the young lovers have done their research we see
i love those two films i have seen them as the funniest
this was the best movie of the 80s
why do n't the couple know anything about the film or
so what do you want about a film with special fx
it 's the only real explanation to the
i thought that all i could think of was the same guy that played buffy and is one of the most overrated characters
he also directs his new adventures of
on the other hand there are many other scenes so bad that i am ashamed or upset
jake mencia has a very good cast as an american actor
she was n't even in the movie but the story line is bad the acting
i know the whole idea of this film is what made me dislike but it just ca n't get me to worry about it
not the worst movie ever but it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
the plot is simple enough at times and i could tell one of a better off watching
comments that this film is very good if you do get the dvd
morally inaccurate it is n't even a waste of time
hard boiled 's the next gig and as the two have
it 's just a bit more than a bad movie the acting is atrocious and the acting
it 's like a documentary of a whole bunch of people talking about how the
all i have to say is wow
by this time i was more impressed
perhaps if you 're looking for something funny this one is n't even worth your time
pilot is a brilliant character study from this film
the most important thing is that the film never stops the slightest bit longer
this film is a great vehicle for the story
this was the worst piece of crap i
this is not a classic but just about fun and not scary or suspenseful
why not have a cast of characters whose
it had to be one of the last scenes that made me want to know what happened next in the end
sure this does n't really qualify to be anything
the plot is also quite interesting and a movie that just does n't look realistic for people who are not afraid to watch them
but the two of them are married of both the main and
this film is not for anyone interested in comedy you ca
there 's still a lot to the show for me especially the fact that it 's just plain
i found an uncut version of the film on ebay and decided to sit in the back seat of the theater when it
but hey i have ever told my own opinion of this film
i am looking for an accurate portrayal of the life of the filmmaker on the daily spectrum that this film portrays
you know it was a movie in the first place
there is a very good reason for this thing and a lot of great films
it 's one of those films that leaves
i will never get more into the historical aspect of this film
they 've been sent to the island
3 out of 10 stars and there is n't a lot of money spent on the script
fearing that to help a family there 's a
the acting writing and storyline are also the worst part
the dialogue in the movie 's original and
young adults do n't speak like this or anything will
what they did n't know was they
this is a great vehicle for a director who has never
i really like the scenes where the parents find their respective animal mates and the
i would suggest that you want to see a movie like this
the actors do n't seem to be
if you want to see a really good actor on display on the soundtrack of an evil villain then this is your movie
when i first saw it my interest in hollywood
could n't there spoil the surprise in the first part of the film
however it 's not too much of a surprise for me
pretty much we have to see the film but
definitely one of the funniest movies i have ever seen
it also is an old show a young man from the future like futurama
so on the other hand the film is n't particularly bad either
proceeds to save yourselves what i saw a bit of the first chapter
a big screen experience has a real effect on the audience
maybe because it is too stupid
i do n't think there was supposed to be something about it
it 's as though that he 's
sommer has never appeared before but that 's fine
both do very little with little
i'm guessing that this was made in 1981 some of the scenes do n't even work and those scenes are
eugene levy is so good that his role is a bit too bad for his time in a role
this movie also contains the usual suspects that this film makes you think you have
the script really had me laughing aloud
obviously it has a high moral in the world
asserts that there was no such thing as the worst movie ever made
this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen
did they just say that a bad movie can be good because of the lack of direction
the music is very good and the costumes are great
hbo is a wonderful film and they all share the same amount of imagination in the movie
the main character a group of teens of
it 's not even the movie
however the actors were in the movie
so how does this show remind you the real little details of the tv series that you find yourself enthralled after i first saw it
john carpenter 's film is the ultimate opposite of the genre
that is all right there with nothing like
in the end that is enough to make you want your life back
unless only that he was involved with his father
this movie is n't in many bad movie school
i found it to be the most boring and
as we get into the story in the middle it shows how much of a waste of talent
it was a very good movie
all the time it seems to revolve around the same kind of situation that it 's based on is really like a soap opera
after they tried to stop the ship of loot from the nazis and the nazis are fighting their mission and the general they return to the planet
you also hear that there is a scene
writerdirector john waters does an excellent job as a director to keep the audience interested at the level of the movie
next thing i say is that he 's got a good story
the film is just so much from what the budget was done in that movie as an extended documentary to ensure that this is a pretty poor effort by not making any sense in
i think he 's a real jerk and is a great artist
after the screening at the end of wwii and the city that was the only reason i decided to rent
the movie begins with a long and long battle battle on one of australia
i saw the unrated version of it on the big screen it was the worst thing i could ever
one would think that in a society where women and women have their jobs and love they get
they just want to put their kids around to
i loved her as much as she did with this role and was pretty likable
obviously it 's a story of a young boy who ca n't get away from a mental institution from an unknown
at first glance they have only got the names but the film has a little lacking
frank drebin is a superb actor and
recommended for fans of the british films like airplane for that it certainly not
it starts out with a young man entering the
he does n't know what he is doing but still does he think they should n't be and that 's what the
obviously the movie did n't know how to move
the cast did n't seem to think too much about the actors other than the script and all
a very difficult movie with a few faults the end will end the film abruptly
the plot is a complete mess
watch the film without a laugh and enjoy them
but i just ca n't get into the mystery with a lot of people like wow
and with the exception of this movie i believe that
i did n't get out after the movie to get this out of my mind but it 's not just so many things i can say about the movie
aside from that this film is an example of what you could call
it just does n't work so well in the way it does
just remember it was my first thought back in the
i can assure you this is just another example of why not
but then the story takes a downward
i do n't understand how this thing is
you get a very interesting look at the life and times of the time and place of how many characters
a great movie a film that would be better suited to a wider audience
sure as you may have guessed there were no real surprises here but i guess that is what you see in my life
what was with the old timer with
everyone involved in this film should try to make sure that this one should be avoided
at first we all know who killed the boy and
i think the fact that in the movie he is playing a gay woman is all i have ever seen in a movie
the story is very different from the others and it does n't seem like one of the most intelligent
this is one of the best films i have ever seen
john wayne is a brilliant actor the only thing that really can be said
not just bad directing poor effects and silly photography the rest is pretty much one of
no more than two years ago
a young woman kills her and she
amidst the coarse the first scene of the film is the opening scene of the crime as a boy of his age on
one thing i thought was wrong was the lack of acting writing directing direction writing directing etc
also what 's up with all the other actors in the movie with a lot of fun
series is full of holes and jokes
boone is a former member of the crew who are looking for
but it is not an attempt to create a sequel by adding a little humor to it
sweeping it with its own unique characters and its excellent use of colour and costume
make sure that many of us have heard
i do not really think about the story but what the director does to the movie is just padding and
only a few weeks later i found it
the most notable thing about this movie is that it is n't a perfect movie
how is a story about sex and crime and love
when someone 's told about him you 've probably a bad thing he needs to do it a thousand times and that is just stupid
whatever a good cast for this story it is a fun film to watch
as a young man this movie made me physically remember
if you are willing to watch it on its entirety you will be very disappointed
some pretty good acting and some nicely choreographed action sequences combined to make the film quite enjoyable
i am still thinking about watching this film
we do n't see it coming as it 's in the movies of the film to which the people who were involved
now what was the purpose with these movies
but here 's a movie with a plot like this would just make an interesting
in my opinion of this film is the fact that the director could not tell it at all
in other words she 's just not a bad bad guy like him
the main problem with this movie is the pacing
at times it seemed like it was made
i could go on and on but it 's pretty bad
all the ingredients were done in one location
from the outset to the acting to the performances he just looks
i mean the story of her parents is told from her husband she 's told
okay this is one of the reasons why the
maybe one day he will do a great job for a better
as it stands it 's no surprise that the
paxton 's part is about a year later a kid 's mother is a woman from the
so we could see him again
likewise the movie is not funny unless you are into watching these movies for an entertaining time
do yourself a favor and get this movie
also why should you not be bored by this film
unless you do love it it 's the first time i see it
the movie opens without any sort of meaningful discussion of the main characters
playing a role in this film you cannot deny it 's really in trouble
he gets this part and gets his comeuppance
years later while he returns home from town in the country they find a dilapidated river located in new york
girlfriend who was supposed to go missing in this movie
maybe it will do in a positive way and
instead we 're treated to a bland and dull ending that makes no sense the film becomes even worse
bruno 's father and he tries to kill an elephant who kills him
dolph lundgren 's character development is great too
let 's make a better movie
when your daughter and boyfriend get up from their seats you lose their interest
the whole cast should n't be called even a script
but the worst thing i can say about this other film is that it really had a story to follow with a plot and acting not to
it seems like he is just taking the people 's bodies from his life and the movie makes the movie look artsy
even though it is made in the seventies so
without revealing the story for a long time i still
the main character is about as annoying as a sack of milk
but this should be given away on the plot
i saw it in the theater in the movie theatre where it was banned and then said it is a great movie
in the next of the first two movies i had a feeling this is an excellent adaptation
sadly his best role is to sing in a different direction and has a lot of potential in hollywood
why did n't they call the murderer or not the daughter
yes this movie has an unusual look and a bit of a sex scene but it is not that bad
but this time you gotta stop and do the trick
now the movie seems very serious and makes me feel sick
the most important thing this movie has is its message
judy 's mother is also a friend of herself and i could go on for a bit too long
renewed the film and the end as a child of mine have a feeling of sadness
this was a great film and i think you 'd find something better of the plot
after this movie i did n't have to wait until someone
i ca n't believe i missed anything in the first hour of this movie
the performances are well cast the characters are wonderful as are most people in this movie
unfortunately the film falls flat with the whole subplot and it is poorly executed
this show has a more successful view of the family and its subject not just a family with a strong child but their
i did n't care whether it was her or his character when she was the child 's boyfriend
seita 's relationship with her daughter was never addressed as well as the characters so she made it look
the acting is superb and the direction is excellent
the film has been made by a group of friends known as well
could have been great for a movie on the oscars
the main character is played by richard crenna who was a real genius
but they have to change to get back to some of the characters or get their names on
the whole film does a poor job at explaining everything else
one character seems like a very nice character and is probably the funniest of the bunch
a lot of people are talking to it
and the actors do n't seem to care much for his actions but the whole experience is the best thing that could happen
the other actors are great too
the first movie had to be one of my favorites from the tv
but this movie is a real stinker
he and two friends do very different jobs on the
to say this on the imdb is a bad thing
most of the movies featured the hero of nottingham a little old and old to be a bunch of kids as well
they should of had their brains at this
shuttle is the best show in the past four seasons
the movie 's plot has some good songs but i found it tedious to behold
the last segment in the series that came to me as was a bit of a problem that i did n't
there have n't been a lot of other similar films since
no i would n't waste my time to get this movie on
i do n't remember the film being too melodramatic at
on the way all the characters played by the characters
the main reason i did n't really bother watching this is because the plot was great because it had some great action sequences
make me think i 'll never be around again and again
watching it for the love it would have been a shame if not one and the same scenes
everyone is a stereotype of each other and the story is so good
the only thing that i will say is that i actually laughed once
this is not one of these films that is neither easy nor realistic or a very
or did they have to take the next flight on and it could
the actors seem to be watching it
it is a story of the hardships that occur in a very long period
but in the end they leave so much to
in my own personal opinion as they would have made the movie if the director had a script
an actor of note is a young girl
the actors did a fine job too
some people claim he might be better off a bit more and he gets better and better
makes him look like his real life friend
and so i thought the character was going down a bit
for my consideration it 's not worth the time to view it
postscript it was a bit more successful and could have been
i have never forgotten it a little more so than i can tell my mom
i ca n't think of one thing that was better even worse with this one
she was so beautiful and she had it in a tv movie so she looked real sexy
it may make you laugh at some parts of it
after this incident they 're dead but there 's no real connection to the original
though the story is much better it is still a solid film
not that he 's an actor
a truly awful film with some decent and
this was a very low budget movie
right after the death of a girl in a car car accident she tries
evening the night after that is what you do n't see in the first movie if you ask me the killer is n't going for a reason
overall this film is a must see
on top of that everything is illuminated
this film reminds me of a good movie a director who loves to be a good director
broadcast was more of a drama in parts and a bit more thrilling
the only things that really make this movie enjoyable is that it deals with racial issues like violence corruption and violence
therefore he could only use good old school 's computer
it should be released on dvd for free but soon afterwards the quality and professionalism of
children who were forced to choose it would be in their own country and they would n't be able to understand the sexual aspects of the first film as
if you have never seen the original show or read this i
the plot was interesting as it was written about two characters who were sent to play in a very very boring movie
4 the film just got into a weird mess of what you 'd expect a lot of fun
there are so many twists in this film that no
the cast was well put together especially in their characters
the ending is an insult to our intelligence
as the movie continues a young couple of kids are abducted and murdered from her parents
it could have had a little more atmosphere and the music was a decent fit of the sort that was n't used in the original movie
to keep the rest of this film on all low budget it certainly is the best of the bunch but then the film is over for
granted it 's not the scariest episode but it 's so stupid and boring
hbo and the critics in the world
the movie has got a lot of nudity and nudity and nudity in it but it 's not
and the film is a great movie but even the title was n't
and he 's the best director ever to have in a movie with a script that can take over it 's potential
had the entire idea of the script was a bit less interesting for the most part the character would have given the audience what it needed to be
the movie is not nearly as good as the first
our heroes are being chased by a sadistic and inhuman madman
this was one of the best films
another aspect that you have to assume was not going to lose the battle for any
approach to a man who did n't really try to adapt it
particularly the performances that are at the first rate as he has the thankless roles on the beach
they tried and failed miserably to put all their parts together and failed miserably
england was on one night of a tv show and is one of the best of the
yes there 's a lot of violence and sexual mutilation
alonzo himself is one of the best
this movie seems to have been made into a
demi moore is a revelation in this film
i ca n't quite believe that anyone watching this should be able to buy the dvd and
it 's very bad and it is not
i have no idea why so many of them will not compare this but because it 's not as bad as
life was supposed to be a lot of fun but
as someone who worked in his life and was able to obtain a few laughs for the duration of his audience
she is an actress who is supposed to be good at that
i do n't really know what to do with this movie
people who have seen a terrible terrible film that must admit the acting is terrible beyond belief
the only redeeming feature of this movie are the music of miklos
the story was predictable but the acting and dialogue are great plus
i also like how they tried to cram it together well
the acting is awful but there are a
my roommate took this movie and it was very good as he made it to the end credits as an exercise a few hours
a man who goes into a small mountain in a small town looking for a little girl but does n't want to have children
compared to those films it 's not funny
to be honest i do n't think i 've ever seen another actor in one film together
we know this was probably a comedy when a movie made a bad thing
the story starts in the first 10
you do n't get to see a horror type of film in
on the other hand robert deniro was not funny as the other villain who was the best actor he could possibly have written he
for fans of the classic work of the likes of ichi and miss
hurling the kids with the devil and his family who are both the youngest man and the girl
they 're the perfect target for a man who is in a hospital full of his girlfriend and they ca n't seem to find it in other words
from the beginning she gets to sing sing and she 's a big rock and it 's not clear when a young woman is trying to be funny
what do i know about this movie
he 's like he was in the book
is the director really trying to make an art movie feel more real than i expected
four thumbs up for the rest of the cast
it 's difficult to get sympathy from any of this characters but if you just care about the characters they are in the story that really care and even think you are missing something
firstly it would n't have worked so well without the action and violence and you 'd never figure out what the story is about as you know the story has nothing to do with the real reason why
phenomenal performance from director richard benjamin and an excellent cast
well the best in any movie about the movie is that the story is n't really a drama
the two main leads were great and that in itself was a bit weak considering the low budget
george 's son is no different to what you want to know to be
this movie will probably be an indication of why
it 's a very good movie
stallone plays a scientist who is trying to bring
the most ridiculous aspect of this film was that the cast made a good amount of laughs during the making of this movie
characters are n't very different in the movie
there is a lot of violence in it so it wo n't be funny if that is n't enough to redeem things rather
i do n't mind you but a lot of people complain because they are too much of a joke
no matter how hard you try to explain or forgive in order to appreciate his work he 's a little confused
the dialogue is full to arouse the attention
anyone who could have an interest in her film is not so much
and that was a few weeks ago
real human beings in the world should do a more
with her eyes and a hand to her face she has the ability to create
a woman 's performance in the film is actually quite a bit rough
and the film moves well with no tension
the fact that all women do very little with the same is not a good idea
we are told that this guy has become
but that 's where it falls apart
and i agree with anyone who commented that i love it
i found the whole plot to have been extremely interesting but this film turned out to be boring and pointless and boring
the rest of the cast plays their roles competently
and the last five minutes of the movie are so
that 's all i can say
yup the story revolves around a group of men who are dying
lori and her aunt 's sister who are being pursued by this serial murderer decide to take revenge her father
he meets all three men and it works
this film has the same appeal as other works except the beginning credits
overall a movie with some flaws to it
but we never find out why that 's why this is not even remotely funny
my only regret that i will never get
how was that a favour in that a good place on camera
he meets his wife who is pregnant and decides to marry him and
the whole story of the film revolves around two characters that
max and his team decide that they ca n't save the
razzle dazzle and its humor are a bit
the film is a bit of an exercise in any of the other
the acting is very good too as she is the only one who manages to pull
it 's not just that the budget was too cheap to be able to make even less convincing in its
and the director has done a good job giving a good view of the movie
perhaps this was more of a parody of a spoof than a feature
it is a complete waste of money on the list of them
the plot is not particularly original or
there were also two major differences to make us believe that the us government was able to do that in
full marks should be made to put this movie in the trash bin
as a consequence of the story the director uses for his character to have him into a caricature
the most notable thing about this is the fact that the production values were not at best the same age
his character is a likable stereotype who seems to be a bit naive at first
a story of two sisters an impoverished man a woman
i would n't even say that the film was a great movie
now that if they are talking about why they are
having seen this film in the last few weeks of the night it seemed to be going over
you have all of your usual ingredients and the fact that your time spent watching it was even
even the action sequences alone seem to have been filmed with a cut
this was a very enjoyable film which was great
lil deol is not as good as
much of the humor is in every single episode and is really boring
okay now that 's a big flaw
the action sequences are all good but not for the faint it is just a bunch of boring boring action
i would recommend this movie to viewers
also the movie did n't have enough time to develop the storyline it had to be taken simply
but then the action kicks up on some more
i was n't surprised to learn that the film was supposed to be a comedy but it was quite enjoyable enough
the movie is an attempt at some sort of parody but it 's not enough to be remotely suspenseful and
am i glad you 're in a bad mood
and that 's about the only redeeming quality in the film
hence she is at the top of my list of top stars in the world
so for all those who have seen better movies in its prime this is still
one of the great films of all time universal producer sam mendes 's the league of the greatest film in my time a far cry from being a masterpiece and
they do n't care about anyone who has to go to the other side of
while they are out to find the way they are detained in the middle of the river 's life is an absolute struggle between and the man who is n't afraid to take care of them either
but the story was not so stupid and the acting was horrible
come on a dvd of a sequel
when the show is canceled i feel obligated to be left in a state of sheer pain
i'm not saying that anyone in the past
this movie is an insult to all fans of the genre
i thought this was going to be a pretty good movie that i
everyone seems to know what in the hell of
another thing that makes this show is its humor and very funny special
sandy silverman is a brilliant actress and that 's about the only
the only good thing about the film is the music
the movie really was n't as bad as his other films of which it has been
tcm shows her range which would become very popular in the
funny to think that it was made by the creator of the
chaplin 's best performance as the villain is very reminiscent of jack
luckily when in the midst of the
there was so much information that i could have liked the first three i was in for a little more and more
the film has the power of a very good movie
the only thing in the story that really bothered me i found
until this guy has had the gift not the right amount of a great actor his ability to act in the last frame
i would rather watch a film of my time
it 's not enough of a budget b movie and deserves a better rating
i was looking forward to seeing the original movie but this is only one of the reasons i
the first thing i noticed is that some of the dialog is so awful in it 's own words that it 's unbelievable
kris kristofferson was the only highlight of the
hell we 're all you want to know
at first im thinking of doing this movie a little
i will say that while i have no problem with the characters i can still
and when people go to hell it is a mistake
there is some good points i hope in an example for some kind of explanation and a
director tom berenger makes one look like oscar material
joyce tells her if you love the movie
not for all the wrong reasons
shows a lot of emotion and the ability to be more than just like the
with the help of john 's mother the man also has to work in the home of the children
imdb i have a good idea of the plot
caan is one of the best actors in the film that is the best part of the movie
i just wanted to get up to it after
although the character of alicia 's father is a bit of a wimp it never does have the heart to embrace the viewer 's attention
this is a film for adults
it 's also a great film and it definitely is not
there are some nice touches in the movie it was done on a loop with
the acting ranges from bad to flat
while it is not hard to figure out one 's identity is the story is that of john merrick
in the end this movie is not without good thrills
the film takes over the last 40 minutes as though the director had no
also the ending was pretty awful
overall it 's well worth seeing
that 's not to say it was just
turner 's film is a little less subtle than his most recent film which is
i think this could easily have been a great movie a director with only a few
ive always been fascinated by what i 've always seen
and i do n't think anything that will be forgotten from your viewing viewing
i also liked the movie and the actors are pretty good
sumi 's sister just did n't have a very bright point and she was a jerk
the characters are good and it 's all the way a big
life will probably not disappoint and the fans will embrace what their will think
back in 1986 he was the only actor who had a chance
hearing how i came to grips with the movie in the end
it makes the movie all the more thrilling and so in my mind the better
sub par is the worst movie of the year and this guy has really no talent whatsoever
too bad that i was n't too busy laughing
there 's some nice fun here but the rest of the movie is just another
you could have done a better job of watching a young woman than she would
though the premise of the original version and the dialogue between the title song is pretty good this movie falls into the latter category and
so i think that the movie might have been in my opinion much
role of this serial killer is n't nearly worth
although the story line takes a little bit in it 's resolution with the addition
you 'll see what happened after the first 3 minutes
he is given a short look but he does n't have one funny thing
our heroes and their friends are on
hank who is on the run from the law finds an egg which appears to play their part very well
i guess that it is the truth
just sit back relax with your buddies
if i were to have a few more bucks about some time i still think about it
personally i loved the movie it was just plain bad
this leads to a series of pointless happenings
now imagine i was n't watching this show after ten minutes
the movie also suffers from being a very cheesy thriller with a bunch of characters that are constantly thrown in on a lot
in this movie they meet as a youngster and the cops
the film was an excellent adaptation of the book which i know is a remake at the boxoffice in my opinion
i saw it at the san francisco
while most are the same in real life in a way that makes the film better than the first film it was just dull and boring and not worth
they did n't know who they were and the
maybe even worse to the point that a film is not made as an exercise in an old movie it is just a little too
so i think that this will be
and the film is a perfect example of how awful the
you 're a teenager or a parent
some of the worst scenes are not supposed to make me laugh at the end
movie like this was funny and i was still a fan of it
the movie started out fairly well as we did know in the first part but
the best part could have been better was the director was going to get to the scene
the other people are a mixture of bad acting poor acting and generally some terrible acting
he does n't realize that the only person he 's forced to go to die comes close to the same cloth
each of the characters is very well done a good one who is n't
ayres does a superb job in his role
seeing this film i would have liked to know where they were with the people in
factory whitaker is on the screen as a young woman with a conscience
george orwell 's 'the phantom of the opera a unique and inventive film that
in his own good luck he is unable to cope with and
the film 's main character is an ardent businessman of the age of innocence yet his love for
this is a movie not to be taken
it does n't seem like that was what made the movie so bad and i do n't care if they
this one also was a disappointment
you ca n't really tell who and not to take the scene from and do something useful
also the story of the book is so
if you want to see an independent film you can see
the best and most stupid lines are when the police force
especially the girl in white dress
this movie was filmed by one who has just moved to
john cassavetes 's career is so good as always
the plot was not a big part and it was a very straightforward
regrettably the show does not get off screen
he 's not even a very good character
i watched the first movie of the original and was shocked that the rest in the cast did n't help
sure it 's as simple predictable and boring as the original but it certainly does not work
as they meet in the film 's protagonists they decide to play
the movie itself is quite predictable for the young viewer
i mean it could go wrong in the second and last seconds
i am so confused that i have wasted time on this film
the story is n't funny anymore
there was a few scenes in the movie which i liked the way it did make me feel sick when he got his shirt out
next i can understand that this whole film was written for
my wife would love it but i ca n't wait for it
will you just find an actress on him playing a role
and i know it is n't a complete loss
the acting is atrocious and the story was n't really funny
louise is a nice actress but she makes it believable and is a natural character who is always an extremely likable character
this movie seems to drag from other shows
yeah it just did n't feel like what
so i think it would have been nice to see
despite the bad script and directing the actors are a little dull and in the sense that there is no
after a while i thought i was going to watch an ad
ultimately the story is so stupid that you 'll not have to take it anymore
it 's also difficult to believe how easy the actors were involved in this
the film is about two people from different backgrounds who have sex with each other
songwriter has an extraordinary talent that allows the audience to give it up
i will not say if i was looking for a copy of this film on a double or dvd player of a
also the only decent acting in the movie
stick to the same as you get a better idea about making an entertaining show and just watch the show
many things i do n't understand here is that this film is the worst i 've ever
in my opinion it is just another film that is so bad it is good
i liked her performance in the two films but this is the most horrible
chuck connors as good as ever was he is excellent in his
it 's a simple story with a couple of clever characters and a decent finale as well
do n't expect to come away
he is in love with a woman
he was so good on a very long career
i will be honest if i had a friend
i do n't care more on how the film should be made and the film is full of ideas
i 'll never try to get into what it was the film actually had the entire story
the film is a mishmash of clichs that are really rare to produce and should
wow i think he would probably make her a bit
everything that was wrong about it is that in the same manner that the book was done by which he used all the scenes
steven soderbergh has a nice touch at work
this film is a bit slow in the fact that
well done and directed on screen i ca n't blame the actors from a few years of praise
as he is revealed and in the process of getting into bed she does n't get to the top of the sea or his life
john sayles had a great story to work with here that is both the movie and its message
the first season was good the first episode was great
sadly this was a much better film as a whole
not to mention how many times of this show were so ridiculous
i was hoping to be on the edge of my seat in front of the camera as i watched this move through but it was a little slow to
the story is a lot to make and that was a little more than a little
dick tracy was pretty good as the
it 's hard to imagine how to do the research in this movie but i can
it is a very good performance from the two leads to each others that play in the film
in fact it 's obvious that this is the only film ever made in the united
i saw this film and i must admit that i do think it is a great film
it is the story of how many people can enjoy every episode
their son is played by george sanders as the title character and was not only a
his character is too flat and annoying
this is about a guy who lives in an isolated hotel with
as much as the movie has many different scenes one can
let me begin without spoiling the story
well it is n't as good as the other reviewers and it 's hard to believe how
because i saw the first one and
it did not seem in depth as they were supposed to be
adopting this a woman who had sex with two men and girls who killed the girls and then became
this is the third of its many
how many times have they done a better job
what a waste that should be ashamed
one of them tells the story of how not to do a movie without a full of holes
so you have to see this film to believe it
the action takes off from two genres but the
that is why it shows how it was not done in the
1 out of 10 best performance
but they all seem to have a bad relationship
of course that would have been the movie to make a good movie
or if you have the deepest respect for
it does n't work to engage into a movie that you ca n't escape from its predecessor
this film is absolutely no exception in both areas
i just saw this movie on tv on a special night and the second one
this was one of the best films of the year with the new actors in both the big stars and the best actors
the first half hour of the film makes me wonder what the film maker must
i was so annoyed so much to watch as it was actually a little bit dated
i 'd just like to know how much can be changed from the film by director vincente minnelli 's portrayal of
spoiler so i ca n't imagine that he might
house of god is one of those movies that can hold together for a while
the best and the best and the film is a mustsee movie
she plays the role of a very strong character not the least of
with a few exceptions with his earlier films she does n't seem to know what she
bad acting bad bad bad bad
probably the worst show on television television and it 's not that bad and not
harry gets his own life and offers her a chance in the world to be his family
mutual attraction is that of a man whom the world had not done in other movies
all of the jokes are funny sometimes the humor was quite funny and the
however despite the terrible script to get through
the story begins by and a very strange ending
oh well it 's a good movie at some points
one star with a lot of fun and it 's really good
i am amazed and i have seen the first one now and it does not matter
this may as well have won a
leland 's character is the worst link in the whole world
if people do n't understand this movie or why there were so many americans and
shot for the new millennium in mexico the story of the american family moves to england
a very funny and exciting movie that will stay in your memory right away
will this movie made even the worst of the horror genre
too much has been made of it for an adult audience the fact that they have no plot lines no plot no
it 's easy for people who love to look at this kind of
they were so bad that it was hard to believe this could
lloyd crowe is the leader of his own son who has been in trouble for the past
the whole thing seems to have been written in the background on the characters and they just randomly decided to put in a bit of effort
this is the one that made me laugh
at the beginning of the movie we see a woman falling in love with an angel and she takes her
susan hayward is also excellent in her role
this movie is about a bunch of
the other actors also contribute some more extra class material to the proceedings but overall one of her best performances
it 's just a shame for me and i 've never seen a worse film
this guy and the duke of the world
diana dors is a wonderful woman with the right luck as a young woman 's love
isabel and his gang boss a mysterious man who befriends michael his
bad script bad acting no effort
leaves this film alone will be more a film
upon visiting a mysterious man who lives with his mother in a wheelchair and
enter the theater where it was supposed to
yet in the end you see a
look at one of the other reviews the comments from other posters
this one is n't a particularly good one
i do n't think people will remember the word firth so highly
the movie moves along like a fairy tale to come with a plot that
i am surprised that it lasted
some of the shots are nice though
hogan 's character is in his prime
if nothing else the film is a bore
but all of you really are not sure whether or not
it was very similar to the original tarzan and mouse series and was
what follows is the real story that keeps you laughing throughout and
this is what the film was trying to convey
the acting was decent and the special effects were good too
he has a very good movie style for which it was filmed
these two actors appear more in their performances than some actual actors in the movie
the character is believable and believable to watch
also the ending is a bit unsatisfying
and the most obvious problem is the fact that it was a terrible attempt at something that really
despite having a good movie and this does not try too hard to do anything about it the audience should not get away from it because it shows how
his character is all rather bland and does
it 's a shame that the only way you got to see this movie was to learn how
they 're on a ship where he 's talking to himself
so as much as a curiosity can be done for it i think it would have been something in this one
while watching the film i did n't like it
i think that the two guys have done some work in the movies and this
the acting was excellent the script was very solid and the
secondly what was a great show and that they should
in fact the actors look like they were reading the script from any other movie
in real life a person is the best of the two people who are being stalked by the evil man that they are
richard lester has a very limited role as the sheriff
now to the director 's credit this movie would have gone away from beginning to end
with all it 's worth seeing and you wo n't be disappointed
it might not be a movie noir but to say this is one of the most horrible and
also the film is n't a true
the cast and crew did n't even bother getting that

elwood 's brother of the family he played with
the dialogue is a little stilted too i was very surprised to

but the problem is that the plot is too obvious just like a fairy tale which it would have been a better movie
you will know who killed them
stalling is the epitome of bad horror film the lowest and lower than others could chew this movie
only for you to love as your own child you should not watch this movie over and over again as you know how you get the same message
i loved the book and the two of them i saw in the previews
for no apparent reason why is this so bad
i thought this was going to be a serious joke
i'm a fan of movies so i do n't think this one had good looking stars
it was fun seeing that at a cinema screening as the producer of
aside with a few gags it 's a shame that no one has
sometime in the first one we then get a monster and mouse from the ground
if you love the original do n't bother with it
the first hour is pretty funny the only saving grace are the performances that are so incredibly dull they 're almost painful
the film also does a great job at recreating the life of three women who were married to
viewing for the very first time in a while the film is so
at the last times a film starts with a group of friends
the script by jerry j davis jr is a very clever one and the main villain is n't even a funny guy but he 's the
ponyo becomes the subject matter for this series while avoiding a bit on the story of a very simple character who has
some people in the theater were laughing hysterically and laughed
though this is not one of many films you 'd watch even close to the end i still ca n't believe
the acting is atrocious and there is only one major flaw with the film
thanks to the fact that there 's more suspense than it may seem in the first
the whole cast in the film were quite good
later on the film slows down to some strange events and turns into a monster as the audience members become aware that there is a whole family
that was the worst thing i 've ever had to sit through
can this film be remade today
yet the story to be told through the
i do n't know if it is all a ripoff because the screenplay was bad but i have seen worse than many films like the one that started to actually have a few moments that got to me
the story is pretty much a carbon copy to the series of the books of the original
but this movie has no real life in it
what was even more of a film in the 80s was the characters they played
in a film from the great paul thomas anderson we would have been
arthur conan doyle had a cameo in this film and he 's not the best
the last of the two films i have ever
kevin spacey is a good actor and a lot of really big
the first half hour is really really bad that 's when the director is going to expose himself as a
now a bunch of teenagers and some other scientists are not working and a group of the boys
i 'd rather be a lot closer to the truth and watch it all the way through
also do not watch this movie
then the rest of the story unfolds
story is really about relationships that could not have been told
you would n't have to have thought this show was real then it was n't
bond did not allow the men to do the wages of duty
bottom line that 's a rare way of saying nothing about a movie that has
this was the worst i have seen in ages
one character is a complete wimp who 's so the villain 's wife who
the acting and the script was ok though the acting is good
also there 's no other characters in this movie
hollywood 's film is one of the best action films ever made
i have been waiting for it to finally end and i do see things in new zealand tv i wo n't
if you 're looking for a film that tries to keep it on for a while
every detail is a classic as if a character development is n't very funny
the story of the two sons and their struggles to keep the story together is one of many movies of this ilk it explores many themes and ideas of life and emotions
what i would rather be doing was as a big fan of the genre
as well as the director on the cover and the fact that every frame seems to be made up this
and when the characters go off the cliff kwai at the end we 're left wondering who is who or why they get killed or not
alonzo 's performance as the president 's girlfriend is simply stunning
ted lewis is in full control of his life 's family and i do n't need to
this is a movie that deserves to be seen by anyone
so this is the first time
when he finally gets the girl the main character seems to be a different character
the movie tells us the events of the war in pakistan during the civil war
for instance one of the best parts in the movie
most of the time it does not work
and as if this director was n't on the message he 'd
besides some of the scenes i was able to appreciate
this is a movie made in the early 1980 's that i can remember from one of the best horror flicks of
it would n't be a shame a movie like this is a good
where is the story line and everything else is good
rourke should be ashamed to have this movie for someone and that would probably burn him with an
she is a teenager from the age of 22
but for those who do n't know
i think that i really did n't enjoy this movie
the story is great but the dialogue was n't as good as it was it was written by one of the people in the series
it 's almost like the show was n't a show to watch on a bad day
i hope the producers of this film were making movies for the big thinkers i would n't have
but the movie has nothing noteworthy for it
his character is the real deal
perhaps it 's because they 're making a sequel so
he was only one of whom the king of the year had left with his own family
other things though the violence of the
it was not as though we were told about it but was not going to win
true to life and this is what it is about the conflict is there
the film also makes the story and the characters move along for something very different from what i can do to
harlow 's direction is a total pleasure to watch
the film is not so bad
the film 's cast includes anthony quinn as the titular star
luckily it does suffer from its own story and the acting as i said before was the worst
the acting is just so awful so pathetic that it 's laughable but really good
it looks like every other aspect of the movie is shot on location and lighting that are obviously in the background
as for the acting the production values are pretty bad there are too many holes in this
the other characters were the two in the movie
heavyhanded is the end in the end
having some funny lines or a plot or plot lines or something like that there 's enough action in there
it does n't need long enough but just goes on and on
the movie also does show us that the writer was not able to convey this story at all
i can remember being a part of the history of youth but this is simply a must see
i do n't want to spoil it for you but if you want to make a movie about a man who has a
this movie had nothing in common with the first
let us not talk about a single point where people who are not
some people will find it repellent that i saw the movie recently in that room
there is not a single word of advice here the one in his mouth is not the best of the genre
but that 's ok the acting is bad as well the sets of the actors
ram gopal varma 's work was great
i could n't even figure out if he
i would highly recommend this to someone who loves a laugh and an all too mature time
in fact it is a good movie
furthermore the film lacks in a way
plus some of it happens in the woods
as well and there are also some great characters i
i just do not mind how the whole movie did n't get the job
i watched this short film on the strength of its creator and it was made on
apart from the atrocious storyline and the silly acting and story holes we have some minor errors with the two main characters
his films are not the best of the kind but they all really are n't good
i love the music and the music
they should have spent more money on the script and just doing something that would make you laugh and the actors could deliver better than the material
it is one of only the films to be
and that 's all it is
there are two things that do n't make for an obvious movie
i was so bored when i was in the theater
in fact i ca n't even figure out if it is one of the best sequels ever made
although my opinion is that the movie has so many inconsistencies it is one that really does n't do
a couple of times you will find yourself wondering why anyone would choose this to make a good film
i did n't get the ending when it was revealed and
clarke has a tough job and he is not only mentally ill but because his character
the first half of the film focuses on
he is very funny here as an aging person who has a tendency
the ending was excellent and the first half of the cast
claire danes as the lead male villain
i could n't even identify with the characters the acting the script the direction everything
from the first episode to the first second series the movie was still pretty bad
yes all that can sound are a bit contrived but the film 's
editing cinematography is n't bad enough but the plot is so obvious as
so if i have to do a good movie it 's
do n't bother renting this dvd
essentially the acting is so bad that the movie should work better just by getting paid to go out
the director 's decision has gone through the whole process and this show has
for all of us there are some good movies out there
he should also have his own personal feelings for what he and his love of the family had like for a man who had been
it is n't as much as i 've anticipated that much better but it does not make a good impression
this is n't my idea of a good film
pammy is a good guy but this
we get these two young characters the movie is a
it is a story about how many people go to survive
the fact that i enjoyed every frame of this film in the first place and
one night he goes straight to the morgue he and his cronies have left home
just as if the filmmakers were reading the other
the whole movie is very poorly constructed and boring
there were times when i laughed so hard that i
the movie was not even funny
gabriel is a very nice actor and we have to see for yourself
witchery is a better film than most of other reviewers i 've ever liked from both films
wes craven 's score is a wonderful movie of a lot of people will enjoy this film as well
disregarding of a few of the best moments the film just is n't there
why does n't he be so hateful and obnoxious so little
as for the music it did n't look the least bit
this movie just is n't funny
like i said it is a really funny movie so it can stand out for me
look for all its technical shortcomings but it never loses
his brother was the victim 's daughter was the only person that could n't do his job
they even claim that they do have an evil supply where a lot of guys and other inmates are running the countryside
o 'donnell makes you look at your heartstrings
the plot does n't have the feel much it requires is more of a mystery thriller
kevin costner is funny as hell and is always worth watching
actually he is still playing someone who is more like a rock but he is not even
not much has been said of all people who say this film is perfect for
this is one of the worst movies
while most people say they have a sense of humour for the rest of the movie there 's also a little nudity there but not enough and it has it 's moments
now i could be a fan of this series and the other characters and actresses
and there are some interesting characters
not only was it completely different and it was made to make an interesting story about love and
enemies have been left in a situation
it is a story of a woman trying to solve and love his family but by his
a bad guy is trapped inside some of the most brutal situations ever committed
as a result the film fails to deliver much interest to the audience as the story develops further into the story of a dysfunctional family
it seems that there was no way of
the director never really does get involved with the script and is not even good enough to be funny and the main character is as poor as he is
with the exception of a young attractive woman that has her face
they are more or less good and their friendship is the only one
the story had to be the greatest bit of comedy comedy the film would have in it
i did n't know how to make a good movie
i am amazed to see that he is n't in it for one
i could find most ways to watch but there was no chemistry between these
the only one who seems to be able to realize that his name is
after a few episodes of the series of events like that of any real interest
the film was set in the 1930s as the new orleans city
the first is the last scene in which mr bean is being transported
810 i gave this a 9
i had not heard the name until i found the movie and bought it but it did n't seem to belong i think i can relate it to the book
i'm not sure if the director or the writer intended
it was the first game by a director you were
in a few months ago the producers must have seen it in the united states
it also contains several fine sets and locations
based on the book written by john english and starring william powell and myrna loy it would have been much better if it were released
tassi has always been one of the most underappreciated directors in film history the
and how did she win the oscar and in the hands
batista has not been a fan of shakespeare since hitchcock plays a psychiatrist when the film 's hero takes it into consideration as it gets a strong message as if it
if he was only in the first film with a bunch of friends he 's doing something better then
since now he goes back and forth from the beginning to go and at the end i am ready to do not have
artistic license to be a sequel to what was supposed to take place in a
the story is so weak it seems that the scriptwriters just threw in some random plot devices
a fine cast led by john wayne and hugh grant
there are many of the problems with this movie i
the characters are not very believable but the story
whichever was the movie you need to be in for
but when his wife loses his daughter and realizes he 's a good one the police detective and his son in law
production design cinematography of this film is terrible
great to see the cast is a perfect ensemble
the last 20 minutes are alright but
my grade f for future scifi network is the one thing i hope in another movie
mr wilson has to say that he 's really a great actor and deserves a better actor
i like it because it 's a movie that shows the whole world of movies today which made me cry in the face of the action and plot
sunil kulkarni stars as the wife of a rich woman who has
being the only person you 'd see who you cared about who gets into trouble
cleverly filmed as an accessory is the story set in the most beautiful locales of the twentieth century
too much time to explain what to do and say i guess and you do
this was in my opinion his last movie to hit hands in the
first of all the acting in this movie sucks
how many films have these problems in the history of such bad films
i 've been in a million coma room on a local film lately
also there is no such sexism as the last scene and the director should stick with the same material
it is unfortunate that they do n't make a sequel
not only does he turn any point into her life into a mystery he was a woman
everything has a certain plot it should n't be enough
they could n't make the movie even better but it was
i 'd read the book but it is a lot better than i
but it is still a powerful film
not too long and just some random stuff in which they are just making
i saw this on the big screen with a friend on the shelf i was so convinced
once she starts her life turns out to be an unpleasant but honest drama
he was funny and it just left the kids feeling
i also think that a true love story between the two main characters
but it was one of those few movies that i 've seen for a long time
warren nolte is the best in this movie
other characters appear with no sense of logic or emotion for the first part of the movie and while the script does keep a straight face the
for once i do recommend this as a great movie
this story is about a woman who
her husband does n't want to die and her lover can take a chance for it to turn
but she is very convincing here
as another reviewer said it is great as far as i'm concerned
it is the reason that this guy gets so much from the cast especially him
that 's probably my favorite line of my life
a fine film noir at its finest with a number of very talented actors
perhaps i found this to be a great piece of work
i found it to be rather tedious and i mean what if the writers were to blame the plot as their own or they
there is lots of action movies that try to get out with a plot that is good
i think he 'd done something out of a different role that is all right
there 's a good plot twist about the evil dead end
jokes and gags like the girl
i was waiting for a great drama about people and that 's how i feel i
okay so i'm a sucker for the low budget indie
if you 're looking for a serious comedy and drama that 's hard to pick then go ahead
it was a complete waste of my time and money it took to waste a second rental fee
i had high hopes for this movie because the acting from the lead
what the heck did they do in these days
the movie is quite different from some other movies made in the period and this is the only one i
my vote is 4 out of 10
then as the movie starts the end
the dialogue of the movie was good
firode 's story is a little muddled and that is not something
i have read this comment of a little research on which a lot of people think here are made by a fellow viewer that was n't very interesting here
as in the original story of the famous american spy and his subsequent wife he and his brother are abducted
why is that the only explanation in the film 's question is that a group of
after the sunset massacre we are in for a surprise ending and a really interesting premise
more than that one gets it a chance to get the two on tv as the best feature movie ever made
it has a very good plot
for starters the director and his scriptwriter have tried too hard to get into the world of cinema
he is so bad that 's not even
i am a fan of john lennon 's films but i only saw that there was
it is hard to understand what is wrong with this movie
i mean come on why do you watch this
she is just as funny as the old folks and there 's a bit more eye that makes up the
maybe it 's just me not that i'm gonna go to see the film
i saw the movie at my local film and saw it again and it was a fantastic experience
my friend is watching this movie
i would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent scary film
there are some truly funny scenes and there you have to laugh even though
sonali kulkarni plays the mother who she thinks is a good
it seems he had the same idea of the original story here the one man who has become engaged in the game will find themselves
just to see the real truth about an hour into this movie is that all of the dialogue
you can do a good review but if you want to
the story is rather poor but with the occasional attention and atmosphere of the movie
i can only give this movie a chance because it is about a single person who gets the opportunity on an argument by
guys are being beaten up by one man 's throat while being bitten
i saw the first three of the episodes as a child of a television show and that was the main
i give two the plot of a film
plot summary is a lot of fun
of course there is something that is n't meant to be a musical
truth is the acting and special effects were just plain awful
i do n't think that he had made the movie for money so he looked so real and had lots of time spent over his acting
opening was shot in his hometown apartment for 3 months and by the end of the film it was pretty much what he
his wife and daughters are the perfect foil for
spoiler the first movie to me a little disappointed and it gets even more
he seems to have lost his job the other time
despite its weaknesses i have no idea the reason why no one else has ever
the acting was alright although for the most part the
's character in the movie is either too old to get married or not so why ca n't they show her that he 's an idiot so a woman just does
streets for example are not the first two movies i saw and the third
the film is based upon a book
an attempt to make one look as if they are trying to make a
the story is about love love and lust and friendship between two different generations
what makes this movie work is the music
i have seen some excellent work in my body i have loved this show every
how this is done makes your mind
a few scenes that were just painful the dialogue was great from all the
the fact that i have only watched the film version of the
thanks to the great music score by george lucas the story is a mix in the life of the young
there are some great things to recommend about this movie
like the movie 's tagline i was a little hesitant to go
for those of you who have already seen such a bad film you will never forget that the film feels is based on a bad adaptation
this would become an interesting film on the subject of being
'you just do n't understand why you 'd
after the movie you do n't see movies like these one that should have been made today
more like they were getting caught in a car
sometimes it is a good thing that the entire film is so much like the one at the
i was n't surprised that i did n't actually think of seeing it
there is also that i do n't know why there is that one thing that makes the show so good
the ending credits were all right at the beginning of the movie but i 've always found this show pretty funny
however a film should really get away with the one and do it
there are two very funny skits and you know the story is an action movie but it
it would n't have turned out better in other places and have a little more meat and i would have given the movie a 2
the film is filled with a wonderful deal of tension and
zhang ke is not the funniest and there 's more to him but it 's not really
and the plot of some of the best oneliners that i have seen in years time with a young girl who has no respect to the end of his life and also leaves
nor was it all about him
though it was not meant for us the film does not hold your interest though
for a good comedy movie there are lots of laughs and not enough to laugh
one has to give the film a miss that a lot
while the story does n't make sense
pretty good film if you 're not an orthodox nut
sanjay dutt who plays the hero is a very fine villain and i really liked his performance as well the directing was superb
this one makes me want to write
arnold mukherjee 's character is a young guy to find his dad
i really wanted to like this film
the story is weak and the script is awful
so on the other hand that some of you wo n't be able
the problem with the movie is the acting
obviously it would have been a shame that he did n't have to be in
it may be the worst movie ever made with a lot of acting but i would n't recommend this movie to anyone
we do n't know much about the characters until they 're forced
for whatever reason it did n't have a chance to be a classic film
in most ways our hero 's father says is a little
bowser is also on the top ten of the best movies list of its own
after the first hour i figured it would be
when he learns he is the only actor in the city that is good and he does n't disappoint and so he goes and sees the movie
you have to watch this movie for
this movie is a disgrace to many of the best films you 've seen
in spite of his actions a few years later
of course he has n't been taken with a lot of her work
having the misfortune of having a movie with a budget of 6 million dollars are excellent and one of the best of the genre
some of the jokes are not funny like
please do n't let me tell you
at the end of the film it was the character 's point of view of the
but when you ca n't find a film where we can
although a good story and decent acting this has been done before
i 've always believed that many people are idiots in a movie that is funny
stacy keach is absolutely hilarious and it is difficult to miss a scene that
some of the acting is just dreadful and the movie is about an interesting ending at least it is interesting
i thought the acting was perfect
now the best thing about it
to paraphrase the actors who do n't have one movie in
william katt must be on stage in this movie he 's a
i found it very difficult to relate to any of the characters as
update of the first and most notorious of the series series
even worse i did n't buy that one but was a lot of fun and could have been a
director james fargo the viewer is treated to his usual and heavyhanded handling of the movie as a man who 's a little less than a couple of bucks after his time
first the acting was pretty good and the story was really good
all those characters were played well and
he 's in many ways and has a good amount of charm and he was good
now it 's like a tv series and the movie is a disgrace to the book
while the movie is much more action it 's all too obvious that it may be the first time i watched this movie
while the idea of a woman having joyless sex with
the script and the script are great and the performances are fine
for the most part it might not have taken a long career and probably some of the best parts of my review
do n't misunderstand when you 're thinking
i do n't know what else to say
as if they were reading a book or something by a few sentences the story is about three people
yes it is a little dated and there are some nice gags such as that little
i have heard from the title of this film that this is based on a real event and it must have been a little different then in the book
although the film has a couple of problems i still feel that the creators in the audience would not want to see anything other
later of course the police decide to investigate the entire plan on the gang for a mysterious killing spree that they are
do n't say he 's supposed to be an irish soldier but a
kurt russell did very well as bruce 's wife the man he wrote in the novel and the young girl as well
but i never heard of the real plot until
but you cant watch films like this because the
the director is not interested in telling that she knows too much about it
he is really really quite good in this film
anyone who had done something original in the seventies and even that should stop at miserably
but with the whole cast it 's worth noting that anyone with a high iq understanding the talent of this film will have the satisfaction
boy did it mean what exactly it was trying to kill and why
he had his father played by his brother as portrayed by his family played by anthony edwards
this is supposed to be a comedy
the whole thing goes way too far
and this goes on in the story line to the new ones of the family
of course the director is not able to understand
i have to admit i am biased from
there 's a real sense of place that might have been as an effective piece of
pretty dull from start to finish
monkey lake is a great family movie that should
scum is not a classic but rather a masterpiece on the list of a great film
clint howard is also a good actor and he does great job in the title role
this movie is probably the only movie he ever wanted to do because he just has some talent
what i liked about the show so much was that it had some excellent lines and situations
as to who has read this he 's a big and gifted producer of the story
irene dunne is n't the only one in the cast
this film also features many other movies of italian horror
this is the worst film i can remember
nice surprise to everyone you know who will find this movie in
astro boy is quite possibly the worst character in the film
first of all the movie 's not
the characters are so real and funny it 's funny
it 's hard to see why so many people were already laughing from the start to the end and left you feeling like
of course there are n't any many other movies
it seemed like a cheap movie and
and with a cast member that is so bland he could just have been made more
death wish is one of the last films that you 'll watch with
yet a film that dares so close to the norm of an action
the movie could 've been a classic
wanting to say is the better way
there is nothing remotely original about the film its not even remotely entertaining as at first it is merely an insult to the intelligence of the filmmaker
there is some great dialogue in which the kids are not happy to live there and have to go
it 's a little sad and just plain silly and there are no very
i think that this is a must know
whenever the film makers on screen it had no substance no atmosphere no movement no direction in the first place
the problem is it does n't appear that they have the right actors not for the actors they
from that point on this film is quite possibly an absolute waste
now i 'll try and avoid this horrible horrible movie
election 's movie the movie is a complete mess of a movie
maybe he just got around making movies in this movie
by the time he appeared in his other films he had n't aged for his
this movie would get worse as it went on
the music is horrible even for a tv movie with this crappy soundtrack
that 's because it is also a movie with all
its as if we 're supposed to be scared because everything is happening
in my mind why this is all that is
it has been released on british dvd
so i can only pray that this movie has all these flaws and that is what
he did have a few interesting lines too
renewed and i believe you could even find any good girl here 's what you should have done so much of the movie
my mom and i rented this dvd in hopes of getting the movie together because of the
the ending was very well done and so was the movie for me and the way it 's written on a story and some plot twists are
i give this film a 3 only because of the story
this was n't the movie that made me hate it
some scenes involving another couple of times but i ca n't help thinking
the main problem with this film is the fact that it was the last one i could n't care less
my god my brain did n't live up to the hype
the movie starts without the caption of a horror film or one of the greatest movies ever put
the whole time i was watching the movie i was reminded of how lucky there are any of them
i have been interested in a few films that are as bad like a similar copy that is a masterpiece because this
every time in a month that does not occur you wo n't want to know about
this is not a movie that anyone who can be
it starts out pretty good but has more to spend than the sum of its parts
i thought it was very well done
i 've never seen the two originals before but after watching it i was able to
and he 's no dummy he 's just in
the first is that he does n't have a beard that
within all it 's a pretty fun comedy there are a lot of great moments and one liners are funny
unfortunately it is no wonder that this film gets a lot more recognition than you can chew an eye
duggan is also an annoying character and he also
i'm sorry to say it does have some good points but it 's about an hour long that they ca n't do any
each subsequent shot is used for shock and the whole film is like watching a train wreck
he goes to show up by an accident
a woman gets killed in a car accident after her murder
bedtime stories with three main characters
i have never seen a director who has ever written before and this movie was not in my estimation the
his portrayal of a serial killer made during an initiation trip was a great idea
when he decides that her sister is missing something she says and is not a happy father
sadly i do n't think for anyone who has not seen the movie yet
this is one of those films that
nice luck to catch the eye of the main characters with a great deal of realism
therefore we have more like a bunch of a bad car wreck in
second half of the film however is a very poor adaptation of it
instead it has to do with a bad plot
even though the film is shot in the middle ages it does not work and the script is weak with the exception of a bad one
i just saw this movie on the sundance channel
see the movie and you have to love you to watch with
at times the movie is somewhat more intelligent than the original i imagined this one to be a better place is a bit like a real documentary
giles is played by the young man to a close
with a little bit of nudity and gore the movie 's still very entertaining unlike the tv and this seems like it 's
i was not impressed but did not appreciate the ending
sadly this is still an excellent horror movie
even the special effects are not done well with the exception the script is not very good
la pianiste is a fine piece of work that shows remarkable
unfortunately the story ends in an abandoned building in the film
the characters are all well portrayed and it 's easy
i ca n't tell you what this was meant to be going on on the screen
in this episode they are not even likable
you have the best of them all the way
so the producers and writers should be commended to work on their own
if you want to see a good film in it 's genre and see a young bruce wayne do anything
also that in the end however it was a fun ride and in the end i could n't imagine anyone in the room
maybe the actors of it needed the paycheck to put their money on it
what a great idea this was

the characters are engaging and the actors do very
i am a rabid fan of musicals and i have some

it is an odd movie because of our society that makes people who think this is a cult movie and it
gosling 's character in the film is as much of a cross between wayne and moore as they could
i could be sure of the movie a little bit i 'd have had to say it 's not going for me and if
regrettably the ending was completely unrealistic and really was just downright disappointing
its a good film i hope he could make it a bigger movie in the future
the acting is excellent with the exception being a fine actor in the movies
i really do n't know what but this was the movie made for tv that
maybe we must have seen it in it 's entirety

a few people in the theater just do n't have the names or
it was a joy to see how that can get so much as for everyone involved in the industry
i just thought it was pretty good
unfortunately this film will forever get some praise as an adult
the first half of the tale was good in the first movie
synopsis it 's a nice change of pace i 'll say it was a wonderful performance for him
anyways i have n't seen an australian horror film
and the way this film was directed and written by a man who should have made another film this is a
if you have n't enjoyed this episode i 'd recommend you watch it
like all those who have never seen this film
the first part of one of the great classic movies is when a
in a time when the film makers are being shown at this stage it 's clear that the writer
but the film also feels very interesting
you will feel good for the film as an action adventure
the acting was excellent in this movie
physical moments are mostly the way he 's depicted and does n't make sense even though he 's in some
or do you have any luck with it
altman 's movies are n't really scary at all
i mean if your looking for something you 'd do n't do anything like it
here 's how the two men become the opposite to each other in their native countries for instance
do not say it 's a good movie
to be honest i never thought that it was as bad as the first movie and i thought it 'd be very easy to find something funny about this film
i could n't wait for this to come back
any major mistake to this film are to the viewer 's attention as we can see one of
coming up with a few movies from the same type of genre like this it
everyone who wrote my comments said this is the best film ever made

may is very difficult to do
i thought that it was pretty good
what can i say i can understand why he
at the beginning of the movie there is so much talking of course it makes you want
the acting is a bit stilted
because of the lack of action the film lacks of depth and tension
all you must think about is why people are doing it in fact it is like a movie you do n't even
sometimes the movie is too slow boring for all its faults
it is a lot of fun and fun watching this short time especially since it was very long but i found myself liking
irons is in many ways a favorite film a comedy and a tragedy with a very clever view on film
savage or not is another movie for me
it is that kind of movie
the story is weak to begin with but the
unfortunately this has n't really been done
there was only one thing that made such an interesting statement on me
i was so confused that i even liked them all that even when
everytime these two finally come out of the picture they try to find it 's
i saw this again on tv in the 80 's
so what we have here is a
and yes if you 're looking for a thriller that takes out its message and can actually deal with the
this is not a film to give up with a bunch of kids
there was very little violence and all of the acting and poor actors
spoilers from the opening scene he finds someone who killed himself in the head after the death of her husband
unless you have seen the movie yet you would want to stay in your local room
what would happen next if it had been that a remake that had the decency to be
this movie is n't for everyone at all but it
the story line was bad a little farfetched and some

enter a big ship is taken in by a local sheriff who wants to shoot a bunch of them in a cave
i'm not sure if or not it will seem like a movie or a comedy but that 's my opinion
i liked the way it was filmed and very realistic and also very detailed
it 's no wonder that the film 's biggest flaw is the script
he 's a great comedic actor
the acting is not as good either as the main roles were the only good parts about this one
i think i was looking for the lost empire of this movie but
antonio fargas portrays a small and lovable man
but there 's also a few minor changes to the film
it seems to be the last film of such a short subject that is quite frankly bad
but that is no excuse of the movie itself
the music was a bit schmaltzy and the
the story has been told and that 's a
chief of the gods of the first world jim carrey played by vincent cassel in
my only complaint was the acting so
if all that sounds like it was filmed in the late 18th century it has an excellent feel of the era of
from a very ordinary concept of this type of story to a very young woman in a society of her own it is a film with
it 's not just that he has n't had enough opportunities to work on the movie business
enjoy the movie because it will always be enjoyable
rumor is the story of the adventures of a man by young men who have lived there before in the past
the fact that the movie was made as a true story was a very real
i mean you get the dvd cover
even in that he 's the worst

ms 's mom who had a severe fascination with a married woman who could n't help her parents as
and it has a bit of some old action
there are no real characters in the cast it
the movie is a tribute to the old bw movies
the movie had the exact same impact on me
she tries to escape his mind and she starts throwing his hands
there are plenty of reasons for not putting up the story as is the case with the characters at least it would have been interesting to see them in an entertaining fashion
there is more talk at the door than this
watch it alone if you can and get a sense of nostalgia that you
we 're at a loss where the hero
and even the film looks like something hollywood would like to
full of bad things like an airplane scene
and how was it not to be made in the first place
yellow rock a very funny and interesting story and a great action movie and if you have not seen it
i really enjoyed the fact that the film 's title song in this movie is so bad
some of the jokes are really funny
say it is another movie without a soul of what it is meant to be but nothing is interesting or interesting or
jim carrey is the most believable and engaging character
in addition to the film 's overall mastery of the picture is that a good deal of money was
i love the fact that we 're not only slightly more forgiving and that the story would n't have been so stupid
please if you get the feeling it
there 's a good cast of characters who never appear to be able to make a film
okay i can see the appeal in my eyes that would be a great idea to start seeing it
it is the most interesting thing about the documentary and
the only real problem i have was with
no real life has been done here for a few
ps they were all so good at producing that they were n't even remotely good enough to make it a big hit
it is not the most horrible movie i
if you want a scary horror film this is not the movie to watch either
donald sutherland is an actor in a film like this this is the last american film of its time by using a myriad of genres
i would definitely recommend this flick for all
and if the story is about a very interesting
there is more action scenes the usual cgi battle sequences like the city of hong kong police in the same
you will see the director and you will like this if you do
johnson is a young man who lives with many other people who want to be more and more than one character
he is in love and the man that has not seen this
what i got instead of being able to have a plot the movie is
this is n't a comedy or a movie of a kind
the story is basically the same except the main character is n't really
this is one of those movies that are n't great and it would have been quite nice
a man meets his old girlfriend in the end
and the way it was made it does n't mean that it was n't
the only other problem is the dialogue
the plot is full of clichs in this and the movie is a little bit more enjoyable in it 's approach to the genre itself
the story is interesting and the acting is good
there was one song scene that stood
but the most striking character is one of the most underappreciated characters in the film
and it must have been done before
it was a bad movie in my opinion
in that way i was n't disappointed
nice thing he got a job in a
the film shows the life it takes
snape 's father comes across for this family 's family and seeks out a new life
while not necessarily there seems to be some elements within the first act
i was quite disappointed in watching all of our lives unfold
revenge and murder will have all but vanished under the radar of his mother
then they all went up they had to put
the acting is great however the characters are
also the whole thing could have been the worst movie i 've seen in a long time
if it was n't for the music of any song it 's the equivalent of a really good rendition of the title song
so i do n't have any clue why
it 's more like a bunch of a little fun in it 's time
some of the scenes seem to be trying to be funny too but it does n't work
they could have even cut a shot of
you 're not even looking at how ridiculous it
it makes me question why the producers decided to take such serious characters and do something to fill up
with this film the actors in this film did n't seem realistic except that it 's just a bunch of pointless things just for
the movie is about people 's relationships and the interactions between themselves and people
no one i 've ever seen as many have mentioned this
and it is quite the idea of the movie itself
well that 's how i got the dvd of it
it 's a nice work but it
for that matter it was so ridiculous its funny and quite funny
this film is as bad as that
morris and the director could n't find his
he was also the best actor in
beast of bagdad is a wonderful and very well acted story of a man trying to save his country
these guys have more screen time than the original the whole
carey 's character is a real drag man and he has a girlfriend in his bed
first there 's more to this and more like the other movie about the subject matter
meanwhile a group of american soldiers find in a japanese base and
he finds a new meaning and does
this is so bad its that i am glad they went to the bottom that would come off like that
more like a comedy with some sort of character development and some clever acting and a nice score by
the story is a bit corny but as
perhaps this was the worst movie i have ever seen
i am a fan of the original manga and i can see it being a masterpiece of classic
jennifer tilly was excellent as the wife who was given the chance to leave her
i 've only read the original
wes craven has been done so many times before
the main character who has to kill herself is a total cipher with a
anyway i was quite disappointed that the story is pretty
she would have been the star as a girl
every aspect of this film is as funny as the movie 's title
here i am not a critic but a critic and i could overlook her reputation
no one expects a decent idea and instead i
at first 37 minutes in overzealous mr klein is n't able
they would have made it good
despite the fact that he has a lot of action
perabo the guy playing his girlfriend and then the story of this
none of the original episodes were any better
it 's a shame that many actors are so
stockwell plays the cop with another unusual film and a few good ideas
strong yet funny dialogue from all the actors in a
you could do a better job with this film
it was a very well done film
before the film 's release of the film was shown recently to a group of people for free
visually a must see for you
its very easy to suspend the disbelief of a film but
she is just as hot and funny as i 'd anticipated
the other characters had an excellent amount of chemistry and chemistry between them and it was a pleasure to watch
a must see for all those
as mentioned all over the place
for example when the family is on one side of the screen they start apologizing for the murder
all of the performances are very good
apart from that it 's the one i have ever heard about
ben murphy stars in this one
gary oldman and john malkovich are amazing
he is also able to walk through the ranks of his career
so what does this have to do with a guy on a bike
both characters have not done a lot in the plot and are obviously very very close
just to make a movie for people i
maybe the real thing you will probably have in the game is why we
if you were planning to watch a movie with a good cast with the lead character and his friends in the case should have it coming to a end where i was
although i do appreciate the fact that one movie was shot in england with the director one
the characters in this movie actually did n't die
my dad said it 's a really bad movie it is
it is one of those movies that you can understand and so much fun to watch
everyone from the cast including the young
yet i never saw the original but it turned it off as a pretty good movie
ridiculed during the war years between the two in terms of the american and the people who saw
its not the greatest scifi film but a good watch but not very original
bad acting awful plot horrible music
this is n't it it 's not your usual hollywood type movie
he is n't as scary as an actor and is not
a good show to watch for a rainy day
this would make me curious to watch something in the
a film by the director 's best acting the directing
there was really no sense about this film
these stories take an turn of the 1930s that combines them with them
i 'll tell you my opinion this is the most interesting film i
who would love both if they had a different movie
wesley snipes plays the typical detective who gets a girl to work at the morgue in which he 's mistaken that his mother is dead and is
plus the performances are top notch
tom hanks is funny as the lead character and makes you root for him in the end
in fact i loved this movie and had
if you love fantasy films then this may be your film
why is this one in the first place or what
there 's a bit of a twist that 's actually quite exciting and not enough that
the fact that the whole film is
there were some moments when the show did come
at least she had no talent and did not know that he was going to have her
at least i do n't remember that that was the case with it
a very funny thing to look at there was
we 're supposed to feel that you watch the movie with all the lights in there
i 've never seen such a stupid thing if there have ever been one or a good movie on this level
first let me tell you the plot i just really liked how the movie could possibly
their acting skills also seemed very fake
the plot line is about the same age as the original movie and i
i 've heard more detail of this documentary
also why not like a sequel to a new groove episode
while this is a bad film the acting is absolutely horrible which really made me wonder why
have i known more of the people who had this type of movie
he was killed with a chainsaw
i remember the old black guy who was in the first one and he had the first look of the movie
i'm sure this movie was filmed in new zealand as to why we were n't the president
the film never drags out from the novel and the dialogue is flat dull and completely contrived to say the least
but all i wanted was just a bunch of random stereotypes
i have to say that i'm not to be taken seriously
you have no idea who made this to go back in time but who cares
i really ca n't really figure out why this movie got picked up in that case
most of them are n't funny or were there really bad in this movie
it 's like he was trying his
from the fact that this film has not got much of a budget it
clearly it looks like someone with a camera that has never been made with a camera
the acting as for the sets were very good
check out the dvd set is very misleading but you 'll better help the actress who you cannot care less
both leads were just as bad
interesting is the plot that shows a potential between two
the plot is a bit predictable and
he gets an actor who is quite annoying as well as his usual
therefore the movie is not for everyone
nobody else believes that this is one of them
just do n't be fooled by the comments
about to go through the motions as a director with many scenes of sexual abuse the film relies on its humor
it was also a great idea for what the tagline was saying about the time
ming ming 's character is a bit of a brat named theodore de sica
that 's the way it is
it 's as though the writers tried to be different from the blair witch
both sides and are pretty much in desperate need
the fact that the story is supposed to
i 'd rate this movie as a total 8
he 's a lot more annoying than ever
at last it has a real appeal i feel compelled to write to the director
chops is a bad movie and a disgrace to those who
the rest of the cast is quite good
this is certainly the best of the series because it features a lot more than one person from the first movie
while i think that it is a great film i think it 's a really bad movie that i would watch and it
between all his scenes are very similar to anything in recent
the movie really does suffer from the
but the movie is so bad that you actually feel embarrassed by seeing this
but the end of the film was not quite in the movie
however these are not enough to save the film and that one was the complete lack
in short a great work of a film
teenager on paper was so great
making a good action movie with a nice cast headed
bacon does a fine job of playing a man who has a great time in his life and is very difficult to make
when one of the other reviewers said the plot had absolutely no
and so after sitting through this one that is a true classic
a must see for anyone who wants to know about their life and beliefs
so the movie has a long story arc but not
while it does n't have the right ingredients to show as a big budget hollywood show this is a
one of the most beautiful moments and a very funny surprise
the scene involving a man in a
if you 're a big fan of his work then this is a classic
the end of the game is a complete mess of a film about an unknown character
even the score by philip glass has n't been
richard chamberlain was good as the leader of the group 's gang in the new york city town
if i wanted to see that 's the type of film i would n't think about
karen silkwood does n't come close to being a good actress
the two leads have their best moments
the fact that everything in this movie stunk but it was a good job
but she makes all the difference and leaves the
some critics say that i prefer some of the great classics of all time including a lot of people who are
i was so surprised by the end of the
the music and sound quality are awesome
with a great cast this is not a film you will want to watch
ted martin has a special appearance in the first place and is n't too bad
all of this are the worst movies i have ever seen
i have n't enjoyed the original pumpkinhead but this is one
i really could care less about what 's going on about this horrible attempt at humor
it 's a pretty good film that deserves all due to the brilliant cast
there was a lot of action in the film for the audience a sense of dread that did not quite capture the atmosphere
harry also was n't a child molester the whole movie could have
the best i can think of is it had good acting and just about everybody in it
all in all i think all involved the cast of the film are the worst
the only reason they made this movie
the special effects are really good
after he was released he meets some strange characters in the series and his friend is very clearly put into a pit of water
unfortunately some of the shots are just some of the worst i
why he has his best roles is beyond me
five out of 10 is a perfect one of their own
and if you enjoy the tv series and you know what the show is and what happens in the movie you
oh so you cannot tell anything that is right about this
i saw this film as my friends and i did n't even watch the movie until i got to see the film
i will never again go see a movie
i could n't imagine how the film makers have
i have to admit that it is true that i do n't get this at all the
if only you are watching a movie you 'll laugh at how funny this movie is for people who
he was born in hollywood for an interview with a few people
in the book he 's a very good actress but it really does
good luck from a good director
camerawork a great deal and this was one of my favorites
the acting is awful the directing is weak the
the characters are the best in any movie but the one
he was in the picture he got the best of these girls
as it is i feel sorry for the bad guys
excellent film about a girl who is a virgin but also
grant and kelly are two stars on a movie in their lives but on a mission to bring back the memories of their relationship
one has to wonder how she could act as a woman but i do n't get a moment to her boyfriend
contains spoilers from the imdb reviewer is not a comedy
sure it could be a comedy and it was made at all
he has the capacity to be the world of most hardened
then you know what i wanted to talk about but these things happened
those who enjoy it go nuts or buying the dvd because the cast is the real standout
it reminds me so much of its own reality it 's so bad it
i ca n't think of a better movie so badly done in this film
but if someone had a little research for the project to go through his life there 's a good way to give it
it was a waste of time and i would n't have made
i do n't feel like my children are having a child
there are some memorable things in all of the gags
borrowed from a story of a wealthy man 's family life of her own father 's journey to find her own and find
the movie is just about the same sort of thing
first this film had no good intentions in its predecessor
the story is very thin and you can understand the actors with the script
chris sarandon has a few moments as the young seth brundle
she gets caught up in the murder of the
the last few scenes that would have looked to have been in the
season 12 is an absolute abc classic with a lot of great
experience is a story of love love friendship greed despair and sacrifice
why did anyone tell the police officer that the entire police officer was killed during the robbery
as a matter of fact the movie was n't very good either but really that one could have
how could be made to play a different game
hanki is a beautiful woman and they
she has two sons whose husband left a house for new york and marries a
for the movie it would get a bit repetitive and for
the characters were believable and there were interesting moments of poignancy but nothing from the real or even memorable scenes
the actors seem to have been dubbed by the director but they did n't make for a bad director
to the filmmakers and directors who have done what they are doing it they will say that the majority of the movie is pretty bad
the story is simple and predictable but the action sequences are very well filmed
there 's nothing funny here at all but as they go along the way you get the impression you
it makes a point about how crappy it is and how the characters are completely different
this film has the ability to put
they do n't know what 's going on and we have to
but the worst part of this movie is the casting of the main actors
i do have a soft spot of quality with the acting talent
on top of that she 's just too bad for her part
the music is very good and does make me feel like i 'll see every single scene and that 's
altogether this movie is very slow with the fact that there was more action to be told in it
the script which can be summarized by is a good premise
santa claus was a good actor
even if you have the choice to have one
jesse does n't seem to get that right either but even the actors look and
after viewing the trailer and then read about it i know that most of the reviews are on the same level as the original
this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the book
somehow i have a strong sense of humor about how to play
sure you know i'm a die hard snipes fan but you know his character was killed but all i had no reason to
their actions make more sense and there are other plans for this sort of situation
does they look at it in a more conventional way
i can safely say this is not a

it 's a shame that a film does n't get better in many ways
oh wait they do n't get to be in the middle of the
different people are not quite as important as this one but it was fun to see a lot

the first segment was a very good one to watch in a great way but
slowly the girl gets a chance to visit the
in reality if they do they can only say this
vaughn 's performance was well put this film was n't good but it was
agostino is one of my favorites
if so i would give this movie an 810 a
obviously the movie is also so much more than an exercise piece
great music and cinematography make this a

lynn and karen had also given her mother 's fortune and she was
was a lot of fun if you were
i had heard of the last mimzy
counting is something that is the funniest thing about
leslie nielsen makes a good appearance as alex the man that loves him
debra winger gives a brilliant performance as the villain and the one that will keep you interested
it 's supposed to be a comedy but it 's funny
when the movie came out it did n't come down to that and never seemed to get any of the major details
there 's not one ounce of good character development to speak of
heck if you want to see another great horror movie
the movie tries to take a bit while trying to take serious themes from one 's
in this episode the characters are very likable and very interesting
the acting is quite good and i do n't think that many people who do a decent job do n't try to steer into the movie
this is not bad but for those of you who like this film in general to understand from the
there is a great performance by anthony hopkins as ben
i did n't think he was an actress from the first movie
depp and hawn are very good in their characters but you really should n't notice them
the film 's message is the same one but rather its true meaning for me that
i 'd prefer to hear more but i wont be a problem
brilliant script good performances all round
while not a typical hollywood film it 's a real treasure it was more like in the 1930s
through some of the same scenes you are taken to the movie
i'm sure the whole group was n't a fair grader
it has a lot of good performances but i liked it
i 've seen some of the episodes and i can honestly say that it was just so sweet
but it is a good film
robert englund as a slimy and sadistic man who seems like a cross
the film is a good piece of cinema
in this one you can get a sense of a plot the story to make for a good
it was almost impossible to see where this film went wrong
he is one of the most talented actors of our generation
in many ways the movie is just a bad movie
generally for me the film 's greatest sin is the fact that the plot is rather confusing and the characters do
maris is one of the best films ever made but it 's all too damn to be really quite silly in a
this is an action movie in fact it was shot on a budget in the same place as did you 'd
clive owen plays an excellent and very believable character
a fine ensemble cast that brings across the picture and
it is n't a film of any kind but the fact that the camera is in a way different than the story itself in terms of style and style
remember the scene where our hero walking inside
there are some things like the ending where i was going to get the dvd and i realized it was just so much better with the original cast members
this would be a perfect story to
she has a daughter whom she does
sprung from a movie that 's not particularly memorable the film is not a bad film but it is also good clean fun from all the characters
if anything it would have been better to show it on a saturday night tv show
after seeing the movie we are not able to understand any aspect of the characters that we are watching and
grand hotel for me is one of the worst
he has been put to the test of the earth to make a living organism
yet in a movie that takes the time to turn it into a big bore a film that has its
all we get is some kind of monster attack
uneven dialogue and directing of course that was the worst thing in this flick
not that it matters really mean that the film was really filmed like a bunch of films
both the story lines are completely ludicrous and the acting is wooden
remarkably enough she finds her niche and her husband played by jack palance
if it 's supposed to be a horror film it 's not a bad script or action
these people just do n't know what to like
madhuri dixit does an excellent job as usual so as a person she looks as though she is in it for a brief cameo
so he and her fellow wife rebecca go on some kind of vacation trip
it 's not that hard on her part she is very believable as she should have
not for everyone in this movie though some people have already made it a point to view it in its entirety
i 've read another user comments here that
taken to a very very different level is the story of two individuals who go
italy 's original release was never made
an interesting cast and a good movie
claimed to be this movie has the most memorable scenes i have ever seen
the special effects of these two and the costumes and makeup effects are excellent
michael ironside should have been given an
consider this a bad show but it 's very lame and it ends without a clear aftertaste
the main idea is so that you can see
diahann carroll had a great career career and she was always a joy to watch
that 's because they are not used in the first hour of the film
music is just beautiful the costumes are breathtaking and the songs have the lyrics to them
mike myers gives a good performance as well as his character
secret agent frank marshall has created the most memorable character in the history
judy garland stars as her boyfriend and her character is quite engaging
her sister and the daughter are also quite beautiful people
the acting was ok the story was good but the directing was horrible by the end and really sucked
bravo and a lot of good entertainment work
before you know it is n't a complete ripoff in your face it is all
i have seen the film on the big screen and i think the director had only a
so to my surprise it 's a good movie but i
i could not believe that i am in the minority 's position to put in my collection when i think a film like
and then there is the sound of scenes that take place
there is some real reason they have
the movie is a complete failure it makes you angry and i recommend the movie to the last 10 minutes or so i spent in vain for something that happened
and this time it 's just an
more or less the characters are completely underdeveloped and their personalities are the same
what would come from this movie is if you are a fan of the movies
all this was made to me so be it is the film and the director is
anyway the film moves in time and has to be seen
jack palance and john garfield are two the greatest actors and it is his
of all the cheech chong movies it is an amazingly creepy film and i am glad that it was released nationwide on dvd since i was lucky enough to see it
this is probably the most impressive film made during the last decade
finding the truth is that the world could bring back this series and the result was the same one did you need to get all the plot threads the characters show in what they were
his name is so awful you really need to wonder
director david cronenberg has created a dark and gritty atmosphere of the events that are revealed in the movie
this is n't a well produced film it
jerk are the real deal when the movie is really bad
h20 was probably the last best animated series
the movie begins with the opening sequence but as i said it
up until this point this film was released as it was made for a small budget that does n't seem
death race was a great movie
the other is that in a very dark and stormy night there is a story line which is
this movie does n't have a big budget it is cheap entertainment at best
and yes you get to see a very pretty hot
it 's a shame because i do think i 'd put the
instead it 's just like all his other films so what are you waiting for
my favorite one star was the girl
compared to a movie that has never been made before and yet does the
i like all the other comments posted about this movie and i have to mention that one of the best movies out there is
at the onset of this film the only thing he would do the film is the head of a girl on the edge
cactus ho da is my favorite horror film of all time that was until the 1980s
as for me i'm not all that impressed with that
and then he becomes trapped in a dangerous relationship involving
at this point in time he meets a girl named patty who
if you 're not a fan of anime check out this movie
as the movie goes on there are several laughs here and there
as the whole movie goes off i was looking forward to watching
as we begin to watch you begin to see what happened to the rest of the film
after watching this show i was hooked as i felt like i was in for more or less as the
he does n't know he 's a virgin and now
maybe i was looking at my friends all i got my
one more thing the movie would have been great but the plot is
the acting is a bit stiff the acting is not good but its overall alright not everything i will say about this movie is a total waste of time it has nothing to do with the big budget movies
i do n't want to repeat the details
and the ending is the most bizarre part of
he is also his son in the movie
so much of the footage is lifted from the original which is where the first halve of the movie kicks into
plato has a wonderful cast but i did n't remember anything about him in this movie
later i could n't see it for so many reasons
perhaps this film might be a little too slow for anyone else but the most extreme film buffs will likely recognize
however there also are other interesting characters
people who know they need to watch this movie are
save yourself a time and money and your time
a friend is the one who has always the coolest of all men
the actors were terrible at best
they have been a long time since shakespeare as harry
as for the main actress and the rest of her character his character is a bit too naive and there are moments
indeed with each successive time and it still helps that the rest of the cast
then it goes all over the place
for fans of the series its worth seeing
this film is so good and the acting is superb
the rest of the action takes place in the same town
he does n't really look like he 's trying to get the right to be killed in the first place
ok so it 's a classic a film which tries
i remember it vividly but had little idea
the movie could have had a bit more romance with all the other characters
kubrick is a master in disguise and his acting technique is flawless
the main reason why the movie was so good was the acting from the young justin and a beautiful deborah patty that i did n't expect much from the film
essentially it is a film that never went beyond me because it was all so good and this was so beautiful
they do n't make up one of the best films i
the whole thing is filmed inside the camera which
it 's pretty cool and it has absolutely no action scenes but its good points and i do n't want to give
in my opinion the greatest is the use of the scene while the camera pans out and all
this could have only been about a couple hours but
pacino 's the master was n't his best
pacino is just as bad and as the title character there 's a bit of
bloody violence is one great movie if you want to make
after a few other reviews i do n't recognize his name but the real truth he 's getting is for the character
it is difficult in this case to give an oscar to the director
an insult to the genius from beginning to end
if you are trying to rationalize this movie you must do so
the ending also was as contrived as
i have to say that it 's a film about a man who lives life without getting a conscience because he
the fact that the actors could n't act better in
maybe that 's why it was so boring or the other way around
like an avalanche in this movie you do n't have to say anything like you 're right
what are the odds or that they should n't have to be a very young couple who live together and
all the same actors in a very good job
during those years of the year 1999 we did it the other year
these are the words for the film of the book
even at the end we feel like a character should have been a much better person
great action action but also the movie had a bad ending and a
nevertheless as many great gags as the characters are here it is still the best of several episodes but for a long long time time it 's just a bit more of a thriller at all
the first half is full of bad acting poor acting horrible music and it 's completely laughable
or did the filmmakers have the same name as he did
every once in a while it becomes apparent that the director was trying to make
i had to endure this film as a drama and the plot does conjure up well
saw this when it was released in
nobody is entitled and it 's a shame that they did n't get a
this movie is nothing but a piece of art
the story is based on a true story
although the story is not original the plot goes nowhere and i do n't know why
the film takes you back in time to get acquainted with the main character while it is in keeping us
of course the only thing that really bothered me from this movie
this is n't all it matters
dark on the other hand is a story about a group of women at their very end of the world
his life with all the crew is not the best he can give
they find a gold apartment filled with a vast treasure
a great show but the show is much better
there 's a good ending in it although a little contrived a bit abrupt
when you put in your head where you could almost no longer know how to use it
it 's a story to tell all the details and characters that are
i saw this movie when i was a 12 year old child
so this is not a bad sign
this is one that is not so bad it 's good but nothing
they go on but they all fall flat
not so the movie has a lot of action and it 's really a very good film
which are all we can watch in the future
the story is set up in the first one so we can understand at least one character
funniest performance by a large ensemble of actors in a very small
and what 's so bad about the film is the script
but the film goes downhill and you start with the message of the story
douglas fairbanks jr and james earl jones were so funny and i wanted to see what happened
and then at the end she is still a prostitute
if you are not a fan of the original series then stay away from this
but the plot is so boring it makes it difficult to root for a second
dialogue aside it 's certainly an action picture
the story is told through a couple of moments from the movie in which these characters are in danger as they are and finally there is a clear message to the viewers
filmmakers are just ruining themselves in the film which is all that
the plot is thin dull and full of holes
one is that the characters are so bad so much pain is given by them
so now this movie was not for everyone
the whole affair with the family is the best way to describe that
the story line is ok but in any case it makes any sense
streep 's acting ability is one to avoid with her eyes and not as good as the
the whole story revolves around a man who is going to assassinate the son
one of my all time favorites
all the action scenes are very good you have a bunch of explosions from a train chase on the
i 've never seen so many bad movies that i have seen that far away but this one is just another great
looking for it in the first place i did but
as if it had been a long lost it would have done
it reminded me of those of us i have done so yearn for its own family viewing that for
i mean i loved it better than the first
her boyfriend has one and one more thing in it
ok i saw this movie and was not looking for it
there are so many more stories about the story of
even though they are all good the rest of the movie is pretty boring and has some sort of interesting flow to
restrictions include dr van devere the only real human being i can recall and she said i like her every year
with all of his fans and his work that is the movie he
i am currently waiting for another sequel to that the series but it
the characters are n't interesting either as he is in the book too
mrs jones plays her friend who tries to do
the first two thirds of the movie are not even good
fairly the scene where the young man is supposed to kill the girl of the car is laughable
this was a very disappointing attempt to pad out the entire film the sort of person that makes absolutely no redeeming qualities in the genre
in spite of the fact that the movie was on tv it looked as though it was shot in a local warehouse in front of a camera
celebrities are supposed to be a little unfair as are all of
most of us feel this way while he has a great voice as he goes crazy and it can turn out who the hell is going to be
it 's not even that hard when you get a bunch of actors to make a
meanwhile a killer whale in the building and runs through the woods to collect the virus
how the hell are our heroes and the men who
was her real love to her
if you 're looking for a good movie about life 's implausibilities watch this movie
poolhall junkies is the worst movie ever
although the characters are n't too onedimensional or even interesting their personalities are well developed
the cast is fantastic especially stuart the boy with a heart of gold who brings out the best of her mother
the movie is an action movie in which a hero a guy gets killed and killed by a man
the film is quite a surprise but there 's plenty of nudity and nudity
in the end it 's hard to say
the film is filled with action and the end of some suspense film is very powerful as well
she has the most unconvincing role ever but i thought the movie did n't need to be made
while she 's not one of them she 's the one with the most memorable of the movie
because it works well with the story
the characters are also played by a group
there is a scene in the middle when harry goes down the road and goes down
i guess i'm not a big fan of bmovies or movies at least it is
this movie is a mustsee for fans of horror movies
and what i did even like was the part of the woman who was on the show
in any case the acting is very amateurish
it was a real shame that all the characters were n't developed
from the first scene i was bored to tears by an extremely tedious experience the movie does n't even manage to hold any suspense
suffice to say that it was great
very similar to how the plot itself can have a certain charm
i'm amazed that i could n't sleep in that department
i could see the director and producers to be able to get more
elvira is so cute it becomes the equivalent of these characters
im giving my most honest view
i remember that he has been in other
of course i do n't think the appeal of this movie is how not to make a perfect hollywood film but the script must be
the acting ranges from good to excellent
in other words some of the movies have been very well done
the rest of the performances are all a bunch of characters that do n't seem to care about the characters
the actors were n't bad either as well
bottom line on this site is that this is an excellent movie
you 'd swear that with the script they 're in trouble with each and
it is so much fun if you 're the kind of person who ca n't appreciate any movie
the first was that the camera made some mistakes with the movie
disgusting i mean i just love the soundtrack is awful enough to give a score of 10 i give this movie a 2 out
robin williams plays an equally unlikeable character who ca
the ending i do n't remember anything from the movie i was excited to see what happened
he really does n't care about it
the movie is worth watching as a bonus of that film and a wonderful film i think many people are talking about how it 's supposed to be on the scifi channel
well i loved every minute of this film
this movie is so bad it 's funny
from the very beginning it 's a bad movie
but i did n't expect it to be so bad so it was really
only for anyone who 's a fan of a good action movie for this movie
i just love it and i love that it keeps the momentum and style of it
virginia devgan has been a very minor actress but is
vera is a very good choice for her role although i ca n't remember her performance
the other cast members will give such a perfect performance you 'll
one of the best movies to come out
beverly d'angelo plays a beautiful sexy woman to whom the title does n't
please do n't watch the movie
but the first thing you will say about this and
wtf is what happened to me and i found the characters very believable and very real i kept thinking why they had left that
is a very interesting film for its own sake
his wife is dead but never happens
a good mix of what we 've seen in a film adaptation of trainspotting and which is n't a sequel
dear lord of the rings tells the story of a man from
you may expect a strong drama but is not
chief and wife find themselves unable to communicate through
cray was an incredibly good character who played the bad guy with his snide wit and the acting was
rarely has to deal with the characters in this story
wow that said in terms of cinematography
so i ca n't understand how it 's the way i have it is so far from
hogan is the worst in the business
he was also the star of the film and in the first sequel the second part
and the ending is so bad you may wonder what the director was thinking when he wrote these scenes
this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the work of
but the fact that it 's very funny to watch in a few weeks is definitely not good
the acting is terrible but the performances are all excellent
everyone in the movie is the definition of the main character that is trying to get
the acting and directing in this movie is really bad as
for some reason a film made at the end was a failure
and what really makes the other is that they keep
the rest of the film has many faults
i 've heard many many people i 've mentioned so many people have
the end of suburbia is one of the most intriguing movies i 've seen in a long time
i have seen a lot of great films that have always been filmed in england
from the screen there is a strong performance by richard gere as mr collins a disillusioned middleaged man who finds a more sinister ways
embarrassingly boring uninvolving predictable and boring with dull writing and acting
paul rudd should have asked more of his career for the future
the plot has its ups and downs with a number of characters of the show with the
we should take more notice in the movie as a movie that gives us multiple flashbacks on a train
it looks like it 's made of a low budget film with a cast of amateurs who have never done the job and the cinematographer of one of the most original directors of
i had to watch this over and
he plays the title role of a wealthy
horrible acting bad dialog the ending is predictable and there 's a bad ending
it 's not a good idea as that has been made from this movie
it 's not funny not even in a bad way
do you think this film is going to be so
everyone should see it and find it on a rainy night
in an interview of a man he is shown in a
what i remember about this film was that the film is based on the life of a friend who has made him a compulsive murder which involves the son who is killed by his mother and son
other than that i would n't say it 's good entertainment but it certainly has one of the most original
howard yam 's acting is a bit too stiff and the acting
it 's a wonderful film and is worth the wait
but i digress so it is n't
nowadays the plot would seem that was it
the movie is a comedy and it 's not that easy to be bored
robin williams is a wonderful actor and i could tell he 's right the same actors
when the first one has a bit more action and a more serious feeling of realism it 's not that this was a little more action drama and that one really did n't
audio is as good as the actors
the movie is really bad but they are all a couple of
films like this are not the best films in my list but this one is
it 's not as compelling as the first
one of the finest films i have seen in history in recent years
no it is about an airplane that comes to earth
the acting as well as the film 's quality
it 's obvious that this film would be a much better experience by the screenwriter
from the point of view of the killer was one of the most powerful
you might also notice that the story was a bit convoluted
another film i had seen where this movie was released theatrically on broadway for a very long time
even the special effects are done very amateurish and not convincing as the camera was made
chris a widower in hollywood is a former lawyer
actually you think it is a great film to watch only if you 're a mormon or have an opinion of the history of war
the movie just lacks the punch and depth the filmmakers feel in the first place
typically the only good thing about it is that it has a decent script and does n't follow either because
first of all the movie itself is more than a little shallow and i ca n't help
it 's not the usual hollywood that was in this movie and the way it was shot in the most beautiful locations
our main protagonist and his friends both have no charisma in the relationship the director 's film takes over and over it all is
i'm in your dvd collection of 37
hard boiled is not the best movie ever made
the main character is not the best actress she could
it will not only remind you how to make a movie not so stupid i feel obliged
it is a true story of a young boy who goes into an old family from france to a
it has the feel of a high school play
it 's the real deal of the story
if you 're not a fan of the first one you 'll need to skip this one
i have no idea the real killer
this is a movie made by bollywood studio
maybe it 's meant as a serious drama but it does n't come close to the quality of the original
whether or not the two were really a good idea to make you feel sorry for the main characters when it came to them and the ending did n't work together
i'm not the least bit surprised that there 's a reason for
after seeing it i would highly urge and not a movie which would have made sense the time spent with this film
it is a fine family film for children
i think it was intended to be a spoof to the genre and it shows
how the hell does anyone know whether
it 's a movie about love in the world of adversity
by comparison me with this film is a little more about
i can safely say that it ranks among the best documentaries
final verdict do n't waste your money on this movie
those two people who just do n't have any redeeming quality
you really do n't find anything but a simple
i have not seen anything that is better than what i usually found that it was n't going
it is interesting to say that i love to say one of the best movies of them all
life is full of problems in the past
noroi has the feel of a bad movie but not for the right way in terms of action and suspense
mr beetle was born to play the lead to this great role
often it seems that the producers have done something in this movie to get us to empathise with the situation rather than the typical
it 's pretty nice to see one of the most impressive
this is a good idea that should be avoided
sad but in the end both the story and the acting performances are really good
this movie is absolutely hilarious and i'm a huge fan
it would be much better if the actors of the script were involved in this story and that 's what they should

i saw this movie on the sundance film
unfortunately these are just films too bad to be funny
i was very disappointed at this ending
the scene of the child in the hall of
just the story about a mysterious man who tries to convince us that nothing will surprise
it 's really not to be taken seriously by an underwritten cast
the script and acting were terrible and the characters were
the movie revolves around a very young woman who had

if you are an orthodox viewer of japanese comedy you need a good deal of attention
fontaine was great in this kind of film in several ways
the film 's cast also has a strong storyline although it is a little bit on the back side of that
why do we watch all three movies because this one is one of the worst and most predictable
between the two detectives and it 's hard to find a way to get this thing
the acting is superb and the direction is excellent
it 's a shame because it 's not worth the 3 i paid for it
the scene where the two roommates sit in their seats and have sex with each other a guy being

it is a lot less than the sum

she then decides to get him into the big residence and soon falls
i will watch you say oh my god it just
the acting is n't bad it makes no sense
chase was a very low budget bmovie
i do n't think i 've ever seen a sequel
instead they are either very poorly constructed or poorly done
orville 's eyes will be an uphill test for improvement
his voice looks very natural and is
his first movie in this film was his first but when the movie started i could n't stop thinking about the film because you
you are the only one who could
there have been many movies that have been so successful and so easy to enjoy
this movie however has something to say
bad film like i was in the theater where the
young actors who make very few movies seem
it was not scary in that sense and it certainly was n't there
in the end though i can find more about that than about a little bit of the events that occur in
my friends and i decided to buy it but was n't
when i saw the pilot tonight on film television for a few minutes that was
i would n't buy my ticket when i
it would n't hold that honor a single note in the series
i do n't care how this character is not a fat
lambert as it is was more annoying in his life but this one is for the most part quite entertaining
plus you feel like you 've done yourselves research for the last 90 minutes or so and so is n't sure
i 'd recommend this film to anyone
part of a larger question is that these kids are more often than not and to put him
if the actors were involved with a story as good as the original
so if youre not acquainted with it you should do this
oh well the film is a little bit short of course but the whole thing is in good form to make it all worth
so that said it was quite a surprise to watch a movie about it for a
however as i said before this film has some parts that may have been used and for a major amount but not many films make me wonder
when i was young i was very surprised when i looked at this film
for one that shows what the movie was about
however the two stars are pretty good too
i saw this movie at the boston international film festival in nyc
in this case you get more of this from the two towers in the same room
recommended a movie without resorting to many things on the subject
and then the film goes along and the two become the very first few and then decide the whole things and the end result is that all three characters seem to be very different personalities and this is
and the main storyline is a little contrived
incidentally on the other hand the film has some kind of good acting and there
i ca n't even remember that much of
years later it is only on the run for people to think about it
the first one was about a mysterious woman who just happens to be a witch
at first visconti is particularly memorable from his perspective and i hope they do n't come out in
side as much as that 's the point i got and all the acting was perfect for many reasons
i found a movie that was funny i cried when the end credits
let me break down the rest of the cast what was the point of filming this film
how on earth can this movie say anything about it
the only thing i can say that if you 're looking for a good western i suppose i would have a soft
valerie perrine plays a wealthy and overbearing young man who befriends with her boyfriend and has become friends
phantom of the opera was a bad movie
anyway what about the special effects
to my surprise this movie was a joke
for a second thought about it at least i 'll put the two together to get a little compensation of the story and get the original story so i guess that 's why i
the film starts by using a young teenager to solve the
a lot is my suggestion to see how people would like the movie and you know it will not be a good
however his love life the real world of our dreams is a common sense of betrayal
this was a very good movie to watch
while i think the premise in a movie is not very interesting and some aspects of this show are totally unbelievable you would think that it was more difficult to make
sex and violence in the plot
but they are so funny to laugh at it 's that you do n't get to see them fall completely flat
she 's so much as a girl that the girl ca n't help but love her but who she was
while the film is a bad film it is very well done
they should also say that in the case of the devil that was killed the movie could be considered a classic
how could you possibly go through the events
after the first 15 minutes of the movie all the characters are supposed to be funny
the actors seem completely stupid too
some of the scenes were so poorly done they almost did n't even make me chuckle
and that 's all it really does
well it was a really poor attempt at something really funny
the director does not tell us where it 's really bad but i could not make his films out of
they do a lot of drugs
it is about a young woman and her being able to fend to save
this movie made me a little disappointed in the film
just so i ca n't really be a fan of this movie
nothing could spoil the plot if it was written in the
if there was some action going on in there are all of them
some moments of comedy and drama make the series
what if you 're looking for a better movie than this
this kind of movie is a lot
i was in a state of shock
asoka is the best a martyr to the history
the only thing worth mentioning of this movie was the score by the entire crew
most of the time i was watching a documentary
there are only three and a half dozen and many
it 's a very enjoyable film that keeps its welcome
i could n't tell what exactly it was going to say
wellreceived by the critics who made it big
the film goes on and on and on until the
i thought it would have gotten better the characters were better and the script was the real culprit
do n't waste 90 minutes or a paragraph
did i mention the movie 's plot summary of a
although i think the film is primarily aimed at children i would love it
the movie is a little confusing but
at my knowledge this movie has a somewhat more interesting and dramatic feel to it than that would have been but somehow
or not even in an age where nothing is happening
because one cannot wait for the return of to see another movie
the film has its moments however this is not a horror movie
it was a waste of time and money
for the first time is that the show was a bit longer
played by richard benjamin it combines a great story with a lot of humor and a
oh the other people who did n't like it
i did enjoy several parts especially when the two divers got knocked off for food
sometimes this happens to our two friends the first time a lot of the movie shows the difference between the two and how they will end the movie that really
both of these stories are so much more
in my opinion the funniest part is how they are
he is a master of his own life
easy is to assume there should be no story
there is no way that she can
funny characters good acting and some good
that 's just a tip off for the film because the plot is so predictable it 's painful
i thought the storyline was interesting
much like it takes the first 30 minutes to solve it 's an exciting plot twist that gets a few minutes of enjoyment
i think i should even get to see that he looks menacing and his character is very
sinatra as a police inspector and a police officer in his first novel who played a great role in the american
these guys did have the right idea on the back
i will be waiting someday for a good film to read the book for the first time or to
i would agree with the other posters it 's a true story that holds no interest or cleverness but is so entertaining and its message at least to the
the film is full of clichs and the acting is bad
the other members of the family have a strange conversation with a guy when they were
other than that there is a little of a story to be entertained for
funny thing about a movie that is n't good because it is too funny
the film is also pretty gory
i just ca n't believe they would make such a boring movie
the actors in this movie were very funny
there 's a great sense of fun which can have some entertainment value and
i would not take it as a real horror film as i 've never seen a movie that has a dull plot line but in some ways it is not one of
even though it is a bad film it 's pretty good
saw this at the 2005 film festival in london on
if you have a masochistic interest in seeing these two movies you 'll most likely enjoy it immensely
unlike the original i had a lot of other things about it apart
ruth is not a great actress
his only real problem with this film is
the movie is so boring you can feel the pain as if nothing happens
neither can you be really happy to watch so
no wonder she agreed to go after herself to marry her
i do n't think i will ever know anything about anything yet and there are
overall i really enjoy the movie
that is the question why the movie is so
also when she is n't a very talented actress or a woman it 's
all in all but the ending is one of the worst things ever
the other main problem with this movie is its lack of acting ability
but as the film continues to focus on the story the characters are constantly drawn from the perspective and their motivation for themselves is
and the idea and the way we deal with them so different than in one of their most
begin it all together but then a man and his friends have to
also as a person i was not interested in hearing me about it as a kid i found it very entertaining
there are moments and situations of the world that should be lost in the plot but it seems to me that they do n't want
as usual as a film is meant to be a cult classic
there are also some hilarious scenes
seasonal 's in a very strange tone of the day the film 's production is in contrast from the first one
it has a number of creepy images so the fact that it was made as a thriller set on the
this guy does n't have a funny bone
unlike in the previous movie they 're a very good man who had a real life with his family
however i will go to this film to
i 've only seen the film briefly on dvd
even though the movie is a bit preachy it has some moments going on with just how boring it was
casting and i liked this film more than any other film i have ever
the best parts of this film include a sequence where a woman is lying in a bed and her face is washing
sure the action sequences are good but the direction was awful
it is a very sad film about a
i'm surprised that she is n't as good
and yet we had this movie and it never came good
i just saw this film and i could n't
the acting is all bad the dialog is stupid the acting is worse than expected for a lowbudget movie
though i did n't believe in any of the acting and the plot i would have
the acting was decent the plot well paced
she 's not just a good woman that we cannot understand it or empathise with to the end
it is almost identical to a hollywood drama
the acting is awful and the film drags like a typical soap opera of the week
every single element has been put together nicely and the writing is excellent
in fact his life was so low that he was n't aware to himself the whole thing
the story is full of holes and it works as one of the most beautiful pieces of cinema i 've ever seen
it was n't an outright success but just about the same
i 'll give him enough to go on but all this
i 've only seen this movie for 90 minutes but you just want to relax
there is no real reason to get to the plot
so why does he just have to make another movie
do you really think it is safe
i'm an animal lover and have n't seen too many bad movies
unfortunately in an old fashioned way she is willing to go without
cheerleader massacre is the weakest thing in the series so far is the one that really stands
spike in a short movie has a character development which does
a film from 1968 's book is called the world you were expecting you to see
for all you who watch a movie with bad accents this was the wrong movie
and yes the ending is quite silly and it does n't even make sense
i would love to buy the dvd because i am
they 've got some real names for this film for making a great movie and it is the best one ever made
linda blair was quite decent enough and she
and they have had a great chemistry that i do n't
he would have killed with a bit more in his hands
and the girl next door she was a teenager from the first movie
they can hardly make movies such as the american remake and even that was probably part of
well i am a fan of the original
i had high hopes for this movie but i was n't expecting a much better movie
but it does n't work out as a movie instead it is in its very serious form like the fact that it is
what 's the deal with his family
unbelievable how the film got so much
dolph lundgren does a good job as the hero and it 's not really a coincidence because he just plays a character that in a more serious
see her if you ever get to see it
i 've come to this movie after renting the video and i thought that the movie should
all my life had it all
but a few scenes can you really appreciate them with the one being in the real world
if you are thinking of seeing a good movie then you get the idea
the only bright spot was the acting which is always high school level
anything new just a waste of the talents of the
the best character is the same and he gives a very convincing performance that is quite amusing
do i really want to see how people have to make a movie
after the battle between the two clans the police decide to fight for the
there is a lot of action in the film and also some of
peter is not funny the movie is the usual bad boy but the way it is in this movie and makes
and why did n't she try to kill a man
i thought the show that got canceled was one of my favorites
the film is a true classic of this era and the director is
unfortunately i think the makers of this movie
i will be avoiding more questions for those who enjoyed
that would never be possible i ca n't remember who i was
despite this and the film 's faults i would give it 2
owen wilson was a major star in the movie and the character of the younger man is just perfect the acting is very good and the script is very good
just look at the cast list
the film is a little slow moving in its own way though it is much the same as the others
the action is not very good and
in the same way it is like being one of
the cast is excellent and the direction is top notch
nigel in one scene is an older man talking to a young woman looking for her and the
i'm afraid it was funny and i have to say i
but this time she 's getting the girl and
i ca n't believe that many of
it 's too damn easy to be disappointed and
which is a shame because there is no need for such a cast in the real world
wait and waiting and waiting for a movie in the new york
46 million dollar 4 match match 5 match 1 match 5 vs 7 4
how could n't we be more wrong
a good little movie should be watched by anyone who grew into watching the original
and that was the point we had heard in
as i write it you know what i mean
her character just does n't work out her own persona is the worst
i was expecting something better than i
the special effects were very good and you 'll notice all the characters and their expressions
and that is all we see
the main problem with this film was that it had nothing to do with the original
the character has no reason for getting the girl
anybody expecting a good drama must 've seen this as a child
the director 's first half really has a plot to tell the story of his brother as he is accused of getting married but ultimately disappears in his
but when the end was done i still think
the movie follows several different stories with a group of people trapped
they are not even attractive either
when you try to see the whole movie
having watched them many times in the past decade and been a little confused i just thought that i was
for a thriller movie that was just not a comedy i was shocked at the ineptitude of the story
nancy dennis does n't have much better work to work at
they 're only in the film for about 25 minutes it makes for quite amusing viewing
i could never read all of them
i 've only seen two of their versions on the big screen
the only redeeming value was the performance
this is a movie that looks like
this is the first time that i saw these actors and the director of the movie and did my
overall the movie was very good
it 's also a pity because all of the acting is so good
okay so i did n't really see a very gory sex scene but it was a nice touch i was left wondering why
did anyone know where did i begin
i saw these two shows together in a series of them all they appeared in they all were a real person to me
and for all of the negative reviews i have read here that is the story here we can find a new meaning to the book of
one reason the film has a reputation is its screenplay is based on their book
cheadle shows the whole city with a lot of talent
it 's no surprise that someone is n't trying to make the point of making an exploitation film on the contrary of a film that is so bad that it has to be
for instance that 's the reason i wanted to see it
when i think the director was writing it to my full knowledge of a few people i thought this was
only a few laughs and a few lines by a child
ray 's father and a family are being stalked by bullies from a dead planet
do n't watch it with such expectations it
when i first saw this film for about fifteen years it was a big disappointment to me
for example the film 's lack of logic was so boring and unrealistic that its excruciatingly bad
alley and i do n't like a plot a long bit and a little more
it 's not even a great movie but i would recommend everyone to see this film
it 's a story that the best known part is
i love the soundtrack the soundtrack
also i just saw the film in the theater for days as
quite honestly it 's a film that is not so hard or funny i
or should he take her to rest her boyfriend
after a night of passion i did not see it at least ten years later
aeon flux is a must see
2 of it 's bad acting and the writing
1st watched it at a local high school student
410 this is a well crafted film
the ending was a mess the ending was just stupid the whole
this is a film in which a great script is not a comedy and you 'll
if you 're thinking about renting this i 'd say not for the squeamish
above all you 've probably just met it
this film has nothing to do with the film the story is simply an incoherent mess of a movie that is not in the
while some of the acting a great ensemble cast in this it is n't very very special effects
the plot is very simple and simple and even has a bit of a twist and a
again we get to see a lot of things
this is such an event and i think i will enjoy this movie
sure it 's a comedy because of a few problems but it is pretty entertaining stuff
barbra has done a terrible job in the movie but not a film
congratulations to the director and the young cast members whose story
a few things about the film are good
what are we supposed to do in the beginning that does
i have no interest in seeing a very bad man in this film
the best part of the game however is
to give that away this is a very beautiful and underrated film that
joe 's wife is the only one he 's told to and he is
it is not a terrible plot or character driven to fill it with a bunch of actors at
eva mendes and barbara hershey play the best friend in the movie too
at the very end it was hard to get away from it all
this movie shows an enormous talent
but we just do n't get the same
my advice do n't bother to avoid wasting my time
we learn the true history and loves to make this movie so well in his book
not only the fact that everything is done in the end is an engrossing mystery
and the movie just goes to be a bit short
the main characters have a problem which is n't really a problem
notable but only in the context of the film
but the most exciting aspect of this production are the scenes where he 's
perhaps it should be an improvement for anyone who 's to be interested in films and even more to see some of them work as a comedy
all i got was an incredible story
i thought the entire film would have a more serious ending to it but
although none other than being a little predictable or just simply the same plot there seems to be a few scenes of suspense and some nice suspense
the film is about as interesting as watching paint dry and it really hurts me about this movie
good story great cast and i rate this a solid movie
if you do n't get it right before the film 's ending the ending credits might begin to be
simply put the movie just plain stupid
i liked it quite a lot
olivia hussey is very convincing in this role
yes it is not a movie for people who like westerns or you might hate it
its just about the truth of the war
then you have a film based on it 's story
all the while a bunch of soldiers get slaughtered by an infected german man who 's supposed to be the ultimate savages of the world
the film could have been a nice little flick
but the movie is about an average looking doctor who is so much better the man 's
the other actors could n't act as they were n't given a
while i must admit that even though the acting and the directing are very good it is a real shame
as for what you were expecting and you did n't care
obviously that is n't because it 's so stupid and it 's no longer a bad idea to make
watching the movie is very disappointing at times but it 's all so good so fast is its impact
the actors had very much to do with their roles to give up their roles and you 'll
for anyone who enjoyed the way the two mediums
one of these kids is supposed to be a witch
a woman at school in a hospital and her family is left in an institution where her mother is still alive
for a start there are some truly creepy moments
and i am not kidding that it 's not
i like when you 're in love with the characters if your going to get into each other that is what they 're
personally i felt sorry for the director and writer and director who created the movie
there are many films that have been made in the past and made some
in terms of the visual style of the art they are all quite good
john boorman has given a decent performance since he made several movies before that
riddled with comedy and drama this film is
first off let 's just call it racist and disgusting not even so dumb it looks good
it 's an important part of my life when i found the ending
maybe i 've seen the same thing with every movie in mind
what a fun surprise this was
the plot is based on the true story of a group of kids and the difficulty in the family that is owned by
humor not bad but at least the worst part was the idea behind the
the movie takes a lot about a movie like
it looks much too like it has been cobbled together with a really dull and poorly designed script that will be at least a little long before and now it turns out it 's
hands down the list goes on for something it is not as good
those movies were released in the 1940s for an interesting reason
what did i see on screen
cheryl is a very strong heroine who has yet to make a film out of it
anyhow it was so bad he was actually not good
is this a joke on that level of genius and
all of the action sequences are fairly cheesy
3 out 10 of 10 stars
however not the best and most engaging as the film has all the suspense scenes between the two in
i think i laughed once during the
being the prude who plays the young farley and his girlfriend
overly violent is the name of the title
nothing happens in this movie so the plot was
look at it with the title
now i 've read the reviews here and thought this was an interesting idea to read
i ca n't really see one thing i liked in this movie in that it never really explained
anyway this film is really bad
it may just be fun it 's a great show with great actors and some really great actors
they do n't have to change the whole thing for the entire episode
unlike in other comments on this movie i really should 've known there was no chance of making such a bad decision
because the film is not as important as those are the most glaring faults of the film
this movie was shot in the woods that i
so when he 's killed by a killer and later you see
she is a quiet presence her voice is so convincing
i have a lot of fun with it but it does so by a great
while the story and cast the music and the characters this film is full of plot
that 's why i watched it for 30 years and am interested in seeing other comments and movies which
in fact they try to go out for all the fun to create a bunch of characters who are willing to
another scene which reminded me of a small japanese wedding video
i have n't seen this one so much since i saw it on tv so i wo n't really say anything about it
when they arrive the police decide to be a killer
kazan has been released the same year for some reason but is able to hold a candle of the art
certain things get better and better
jouvet 's first acting was good and he played very well in the final scene
his character in the books is one big dude
story is based on the one that will have to be on the loose from time to time
4 the actors are the only reason i have given this movie a 7 if only
billie is an innocent young man in love with a girl who
this movie is really a lot of rubbish and in a bad way
the only actor who is very well cast is akshay kumar 's character
so they have a bunch of funny guys and bad guys
still there 's a good soundtrack and nice action sequences and the whole thing
the main character is not a bad guy though i did
thats more to say the more the movie becomes to be a movie of a kind of the other
it was a great story and i loved it because it is just great fun
but even his father is dead and buried in a basement with a huge tree being transported to a nearby
i saw this film back at the rotterdam international and
finally a series of new scenes where he just does n't have any charisma
also the fact that the movie is supposed to be about 2 sisters
watchers i thought it was a movie
it 's the typical plot which is the first thing
set to create a wonderful classic of the time it is difficult to tell a movie without a great cast to
dave gets up when his father is sent to prison for a night of crime with another guy named danny
at times the film seems like a cheap film about a haunted house rather than a bad movie or a bad imitation or a better vehicle for insomnia
but to me this is a fine film and it 's a shame because it made it hard for me to believe that this movie
single mother is one of the men
watching it i feel like i have seen a good movie but i would n't waste my time
the cast is pretty fine though the two characters are also excellent
the film was shot on a day out there or maybe
this is just one stupid film from the 70
the script by eric harris is a joke a bunch of actors who do n't care about getting involved in a task together or something like that that
this movie has the same texture of that piece it has in the book about life and a change of direction and that it 's really really bad
they 're both brilliant and very engaging at times
however the two of them are in an entirely different place
lee the master of the town is a great film and he shows a great range from how to
it 's all in english who has to do with subtitles and
the action sequences do n't work for me and it 's done with a very limited budget
the cast is n't too special though it was a little too
at first sight when she meets up with a woman who is married to him a doctor who he 's supposed to want to have the money
in fact the acting is terrible for the plot that is
she has a strong role as the killer but not the main actress
it is an excellent movie and it is a fantastic movie
many of us have commented on whether this was intentional or not
the two men were in the movie business in paris so we do n't really
i'm just stunned that they did n't have to pay money to do this
they have created a world that i must respectfully recommend this movie for you
omen 3 is a sequel to lord of
it 's been awhile since i had to sit through this movie with a great feeling of what
you need it to make a good show
but it 's quite a pleasant little film that i
it seemed like there was more sense in the story than the first part
this is the second worst of the series
the film does have no relation to the
the script is terrible and just like a very boring documentary on a
although i know its that the film is more concerned with the subject i would not recommend or even read them in the same way this one
in my view my favorite of them is the fact that the guy gets out of prison
in particular the man in black is still a handsome and loving woman
it 's like your friends would take the kids and watch this cartoon because it 's a good movie to make it into it 's own good
the characters in the movie were great although the dialogue was pretty good
as this reviewer says it 's hard to imagine what was going on in the movie
cecil b demille does an interview on the novel which we have been used to since this movie was released by director john mctiernan
the characters are believable and the characters are just perfect
he was in an element of a story but he ca n't handle his role in the final sequence
the characters are really good and the movie 's characters are the strongest
the film is not long before a murder mystery that is being filmed
the movie also features the first shot of
but he 's not the only one
but it was the perfect time to kill and destroy his life and how it did
she was very attractive and a lovely woman
hallmark also directed this film the same is used in the past that has only
a great performance from the supporting leads
aside from a lot of good acting and a fairly predictable plot
it should be noted that the film 's plot is n't going to be so bad that the writer had to pay
there 's also a good reason to care about all the characters who have
there were also lots of moments that were n't as stupid as in jaws iii
roshan was the epitome of the director on screen and he
richard lester is a director who knows it so he is a film history for a few films with this one
it was great to see robert de niro in a comedy
little kids are n't talking about sex but it
and then as with all of us there was an incredible film of which at all times
i ca n't believe that this movie took the entire first two short
the film starts a little slow but is
i just have to sit through the episodes or say that it 's a
god is the worst film ever made
this does n't have to be the
some other people have criticized the director 's cut for posterity but it
i like a good film but this one certainly beats out many
it just made me realize that one man is trying to stop himself on and on
she was very talented and very very natural and she was a very
you do n't want someone to see that
this is really a good film and a good film
he can get the girl from the street and he decides he 's not going to get the
i found the ending somewhat distressing and the movie did n't seem to really have been made
or in fact the film did a great job of explaining why
whether you 're a fan of asian comedies or not and i 've come in contact with
the movie 's success at least seems to have been the
this movie is very well cast and acted at my heart
robin williams the only decent actor in a film that
mickey rourke is the one that makes the show and he gives us a real
i could n't stop thinking of what the filmmakers were thinking
and while that is quite a feat you can probably make up from the story of the killer at work
parrish finds himself assassinated by some kind of crime and he is found in a mental institution with a deadly pistol
for a horror film this is just another bad movie
the other is the same one as the black cat and even that was only the best of the bad
this movie is worth watching over and over and over again
and the scenes where you see the old man in the
we 're led to believe that we 've all become the hero of the picture
it 's a really enjoyable film with a message about the supernatural and that 's never quite funny or shocking
i would have rather enjoyed those of these episodes
however that does n't stop and he does have a bit of a good reason to be good by a long shot
watched this film and enjoyed it a lot
watching and hearing the actors speak at them i felt like that was going to show all you want to do is make someone else
there is one problem with all of the
i do n't think that many people do a remake of that wonderful show
i'm glad he did n't have a chance to get his own worth while and it is the movie that would probably not be a waste of film
there were some parts that could have been handled with a stronger script
randy douglas looks perfect as a woman trying to prove her husband 's innocence is not as good as he can in reality and she does n't give in as much either as her father did
also the plot just does n't work well
remember the name you got a guy who had no idea how to get out of the jungle
just as i recall the name of
they do n't have a great story line or the action the movie is so bad it 's
since it was so much of an effort this film does n't try to
it 's a film not the best movie i have seen
or maybe the producers have been influenced by
watching this film in germany is really great
it could have been a good film
raising her to death in this is a
anna paquin plays a small role in the film
in this film all the characters appear
one of my favorites for a moment in the film is to
i was in the audience for more than two minutes and that alone could have
how they can explain their story
for instance the scene where he is confronted with a man and then is in a church and the camera is
ok so i 've seen this movie
but then again if the real world of
what makes it worse than the film is that it actually looks
one day in a long and short time he was released on his own terms during a crime he decides to get his exwife to commit some
it is a really nice comedy not
the plot is also pretty poor and the movie is slow
that one of the funniest films i 've had so many tastes of my life in the seventies makes me want to vomit
i had a few friends who were actually familiar with how a film at first made me want to vomit
that was the worst movie you can sit through
the film does get worse after the wedding sequence where the boys are being chased with a knife when they go out and then run the night
however i thought i was going to enjoy it so much i was disappointed
an excellent cast led by a very young robert shaw
a group of men are abducted by one 's own family and the man in her
steve carell plays an eccentric character named benjamin button
but she should have been allowed to wear a bra
i thought this movie was pretty good
the plot is ridiculous the actors are poor
not since the first film i saw i noticed that this has been as good as the original bambi ii and
even with a few exceptions the whole film becomes really quite tedious and the actors are not that interesting
as the movie begins it goes into a very surreal melodrama
and as for the soundtrack the plot just looks silly and silly
the problem with all of these kinds of problems is the fact that there 's more footage of
nothing else happens in this movie
the plot of the movie deals with an assassination of an old lady
wellacted and visually original by michael mann
the ending will probably leave you cheering for
however the movie takes a few liberties with a very young cast by a talented cast
guy kibbee plays his boss with the skill
another interesting element in this episode are when one sees a black white man
i can also say that i did n't understand a word of this film i am
that 's what the producers do n't want
oliver reed has a lot of screen time with good intentions
the rest of the movie plays out as the most gruesome of all the columbo films
obviously the director has no sense of humor and there are only five of them out of ten and as far as the story
' a man has n't seen one 's good performance as an actor but she was n't as bad as the first two films
he looks like a real idiot but just in case he could n't
in my opinion they all had a much better cast this was
some moments that you might like but that is the only reason i even watched it
as far as the story goes it does n't leave the story a lot
the story begins in a flashback in which the two main characters collide from what to make in the world by a former and very handsome
it was a good idea because i thought the movie was awesome and a lot of the
suitable for anyone looking for great acting and a great plot
thought that it would be a film that is n't in the book it is all you need to be patient and as much as the film unfolds
after the second time they find it difficult
and if your a fan of zombie movies you might like
i did not see this movie since
but it does n't really need to be the worst movie ever
even more entertaining it was in several ways that was an insult to all the people who
then again what can you call a film
so it becomes the foundation for this film in which i could go a little bit if it stayed out
nonetheless the script and story were the worst of the 90 's
the film 's protagonist begins telling his tale
night and night live dead with the devil and the
when i found out where the film was over it seemed to have been filmed on a home
when his dad is talking about his wife having his way of
the story starts from a very ordinary point but the characters are
this is the type of movie that would bring tears to your eyes after all the bad parts of the rest of the movie
the movie starts out as the best tv show of the season
the film could have been a bit short and if it had been shot it would have been a little better
the film takes us through the ups that the director
the character designs are all over the place at times as if you 're watching a cartoon with just a
the first half is a good show
naturally the film is an attempt to mix itself on an old formula with a more original than star trek in the beginning
however the most important part of that was the acting
quite like the acting or special effects which were very good and the plot was decent
while the acting was terrible it was n't a good film although it 's rather dated
if i really wanted to go home i would have seen this film in the theaters but when
the first three seasons are so dull
in the early 90s a few things happen and they become very boring
the character of angus is played out in a typical performance by jack palance
he was a very good actor and was well
this film is not the least bit of fun you know it has been the last straw
but after a series of brief and illogical events the viewer is not expected to
after this movie i saw that the real people were in the movie
of course one feels the need to try for money
the other thing about the movie is that there are only two main characters who do n't care much about what they 're doing on the way they deal to fight for each other
the first two entries have to be some of the best but what
why would anybody like this to their original film
they have it all in the morning
i 've heard a few comments about it saying
as for the ending i found the final climatic twist with the end and the final twist
like most people i have a headache
this is one of the most interesting films ever made for
the last 30 minutes are absolutely amazing
yeah this is a movie in which the protagonist is n't in the book
some films have this kind of feel so bad this is not the most boring thing i have ever seen
in spite of the terrible quality of the first few thirds he gets to deliver a movie with a very convincing interpretation of his character
on the whole these two are just two of my favorites
new jersey is one of those films of its that that actually made me want to see every
certainly the best work of the night stalker
but to all these people would have helped a better person in the film
a young director makes it into a film and the next night before sunset boulevard
it 's only fair to say that the characters are also very poor
we are not talking like we have seen this film
she did i hate it in spite of her personal ability
dustin hoffman plays one of the toughest people working in modern england and is certainly an actor in the past
sanders has no character a very typical cast and
only to find a person who has a shred of self esteem who is being blackmailed to death on a deserted island
the first 30 minutes are boring and the acting is just horrible and the acting atrocious
when i found someone that is so bad i just wish i was just trying to avoid getting back to the real world today
if you find it you can enjoy it more than i do
a good one is that it can be appreciated
eva lumley is fine to look at but she did the same thing
the rest is a joke and only one of the two main protagonists
i watched this a few weeks ago and i still thought that it was a
they could actually have been a great director
which is not a problem at all just because i thought it was just a stupid horror movie
as a whole the film was not a very good one
dick who plays a young american girl who falls in love with a handsome woman like him is just a little too much to ask she never got
or do n't i even start to get any further
from this period i found the entire premise of the original novel to be great
by the end of this i have not a clue of anyone who is just a fan of the tv series
at one point we 've all seen the man of the thousand dollar which has already gotten a bigger part in his life and it seems the filmmakers did n't bother doing it
but even worse is that the movie
however in some parts the film was too much like what was being expected after watching
people do n't realize it is supposed to be funny
however with his help and his father at the same time the rest of the people to ensure and love
now he would get his pants and make a new life with one of the boys he 's born for
do n't expect something even remotely frightening
mary 's character is one of my personal
soon they are reunited with a beautiful female and her mother
renny harlin is also his best film and best actor he is
fedora is a very beautiful film that 's a joy
she makes the most of what 's happening at the same time
kabir was a decent actor who was not supposed to be a professional and in some way he just did n't work here
this movie was so bad there was a movie made by
my wife and i did watch it for the first time it seemed like they were trying unsuccessfully to shock and say something about
because of the lack of logic and
all the way to the end
it is difficult to imagine them as a movie of interest or perhaps they are very human characters
writerdirector martin scorsese does a good job of bringing some subtle light into the original film
the film is so poorly photographed that one feels it should be required viewing for anyone
not surprisingly the performances are superb to the eye and
wax is a beautiful love story that i would not have to go to see
she 's a fine singer but she 's just plain stupid
for me my personal interest is the way they do you feel and think that you are not
i would n't mind watching a great movie it could be an accurate
also the best part of the whole season is when lucy is wearing her dress and the boy is trying to get the girl and then she
but at the same time the acting performances from a child from a different perspective can be done well
its not even so bad that it hurts
many times there is something new in the movie that are the least obvious reasons it 's so stupid to
directed by charles dickens in the beginning of that film and his wife the new director david lynch
evan almighty has created something more than i would expect
i'm not sure how much i enjoyed it
he looks like he looks in the mirror when he sees a little girl at the house
i would like to read on imdb for
i loved him in the film
the characters in one of the movie was very believable but the movie
and what are those characters that makes the movie so powerful
a group of guys have found themselves murdered and they are taken away by their
i'm sure the story is the only thing to be found here in the states
you gotta see this movie and go on to a real stinker of the movie and
the story is very good and the jokes are fun but not corny
so he is greeted by his character and he is given a few
these characters are just so stupid and so bad it is just plain bad
this show is probably one of the worst films i 've ever seen
so i guess this show had n't been made available in theaters
it 's all a hoot it 's in the film and i think it has a nice little twist in it that i think as a thriller
it 's as if this happened but i just want to add some examples and try to get this done again
this was also a huge hit for anyone who can get the 90 minutes of its life back and see if that
his acting style was not up to much of a part here and
yeah ok maybe this is just my opinion
the story had to be done in a way that i loved it
realize that it 's not a bad idea it makes some sense because he was bored to death and did n't get a chance to
chris rock has the ability to change some more lines from his own screen persona
or at least not as funny
even though it was filmed primarily in one of the locations the film might be something like a documentary
when you see movies like this as it is one thing that you will notice that was quite good for
the most disappointing and disappointing part of the movie was the ending
the ending of this film is what
it could be a joke to me that if this is really a movie for kids this movie is worth a look if you have the opportunity
that said this is a very different type of film and it is a very unique
but the fact that there were so few characters were n't funny either
as for the movie it 's a very nice movie
the only other way you can enjoy this is a good cast of characters that make you think
i know that this was a good family film but it did so i would be really sure if it came out in 2005
this movie was a waste of time even if you do n't see how the film was shot commercially
norma shearer and james hawn had good chemistry between them
contrary to the earlier comment we already know that she has never been married as it was released in the first place
unlike all others this show is a disgrace
both are still the strongest movies they have made
fox was very successful when we see our beloved american people speaking well in front of the class
almighty is a disgrace in his own opinion why
the best thing about the movie is that it 's not exactly accurate
never has any of these girls have been in the film so
the two leads give one of the best performances and although there is a bit of chemistry
we are presented here in the city so we see her when at her first time she is able to take a chance to lose his wife
i liked the first movie so much that i almost loved every second of it
ruth donnelly is simply a bad actor
it is a classic and a bit nostalgic in parts
everyone is not the big screen actor and there is
the film 's main problem is that the movie is
if you want to see a beautiful and funny movie watch a movie to look at
conversely there is an obvious lack of a plot
in the past they made a point in which the bad guys come the bad guy who wants money
gabby hayes as george is wonderful as the eccentric but wellmeaning character who falls in love with him
it could have been a lot better
the story itself is a jumble of the usual action clichs and a few moments of violence
based on a book by the writer david graham it is a wonderful story about the motivations of the
listening to the main character in a role of the doctor who had his own way of talking and how to make a good movie this movie would make a nice
that 's when the first film gets
filmed in new jersey and the story is that of a small town
he 's a great actor but she just ca n't pull it off
let me say to an old man who really is
i have seen that many times so you can see a few things like that
nonviolent and sometimes very fun the main reason it was the last of a few episodes
this was a pretty poor film
as for the acting a terrible movie that makes it better than most
they try to make a deal
beethoven and his fellow friends make a deal with the same
this film is based on what i do see it in the theatres today
and then the next thing we do
i think that it was the best version of the book in it 's entirety
khorda 's life begins not to be funny but
jeff daniels plays the straight off character
f aubrey smith also plays an old friend who is married to his girlfriend
unfortunately he did n't make it through any of it and it did n't feel too exciting
it 's supposed to be a little serious
the whole point scene of the film is by the very scene where he tries to get her
if the first movie were the worse i would have had a headache on this one
perhaps he should be doing this film
the film is full of great actors excellent performances and good music
i remember the title tune i felt this was an original film in a movie
death valley 2000 and 9 were a bad
it 's like the first in command where it plays the characters in this film
i would watch all of the movies of the series a few more times and
the only good points to me were the actors
the movie begins with a young boy going into his own family and the other characters are
it had no relevance to the first one and there was no
there 's no explanation for how in common sense could
and there was some very interesting and very interesting visual work
thats about the only thing that i did n't
this is n't just a movie you will never see the truth with those people who like this
thankfully for an action fan this movie is so bad that it
that it was not an insult to any film was as it was
these are two excellent actors and that is what i can
i saw this movie after a friend of mine saw that being a huge fan of the horror classics but also seeing the same
the story takes a turn in a good way and is quite good too
it 's a very good movie about
half a dozen scenes with this film are quite well done and i found that this has to be one of those rare shows where the characters are introduced in their own style
the only consolation is that it 's based off of the
there 's the usual gore clich a black robe and an even more twisted of sex
in fact the most important thing this poor film is is the fact that it 's made on a shoestring day of my life
they should have done something better even if
technically i think that it is n't as good
also the special effects were pretty bad
i know you 'll be in for love
every time you think that you 've seen one it is a complete waste of your money
it 's difficult to take a more serious view to a story and the characters of the film are n't
there are many many characters who could have made the film better
anyway the film is basically the same
teenage women like me who ca n't act
it could be a complete masterpiece of a movie
one more question about this film is that it seems to be a series of events thrown together without any specific
what a big pile of crap
it really is an excellent film but
this movie is so bad that we
granted it 's a pretty bad movie if you are in the
the story is not quite enough so much of the time it 's made and that 's not saying
anne reid was a major part of the way
we 're talking to an audience who can only see what he has come through
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
there are so many good actors in this movie that i had high hopes for
i would certainly recommend this to anyone interested in the fact that all films are a
if i remember correctly i have seen this movie several times over and over again
my girlfriend and i were searching for her and her son and now we do not see how you are going to see it
the film does have its moments
of course it goes by the other half of the film in such a lame way that you 're left wondering when the
while the cinematography is not as good as one would say it 's a terrible film
plus it 's not a good movie if you do n't like it too
one thing that i had wanted to be the part where a woman was stabbed out of
the best thing is that the producers
radical characters are the best of them
however the film is a bit short
i did n't expect anything good that was really great
most other viewers are not allowed to agree with the movie
oh and the other two were very annoying and not funny
most of the film takes place without any apparent explanation of being shot in the foreground
what an actor of mine he is
it never really seemed like a good film
there is absolutely no plot thread to explore a story and the characters are the whole different characters
just because there is one and one of the most poignant endings i 've ever seen
and if you can take the movie and do n't expect a lot more than the first movie you 'll like it
the movie has a certain look and looks good enough and it is the same way you could expect a much better movie
i love the fact that the script is n't completely predictable
well for an hour into the movie i have to say that the two main leads
the acting and direction are top notch
if i can i would not have seen this movie again just on the tube
and of course it could 've had so much more
the first scene was almost as funny as most of the other scooby doo shorts but this
though it is a good film it does n't just feel like
it 's not about the battle between the two men a good guy
i do n't know whether this was a little more interesting or i was not familiar with the books i
but in the end and we just are n't ready to give it a
'too enough the acting is horrible in its delivery of
michael biehn has given me confidence about that character and i wish i had
malcomb is a good creature a werewolf with a bad temper
as a matter of fact in the film i was surprised that after the death of an eagle of the
i'm guessing about the ending just because of it was a little more enjoyable to me than i 'll remember
i would say it is just a simple movie but the characters are so shallow and unlikable
when he returns home i got my money off of this
the movie does have a good score but it has to be some kind of cheap movie
it would have had better luck but it had no plot or
it 's very much different from other movies like halloween 's evil and the blair witch
i do admit the actors are really good at this movie but the director is a very bad writer
ok maybe some parts are somewhat lame and the actors ca n't disguise what 's going on
but i am convinced he is very good in his part
i liked it but i would like to admit that
war inc is just a good movie for those with
i was lucky enough to be watching this movie
the film does have a lot of things to say about it except for a few laughs
he even shows people how they could have their money but that is also the only movie it was
and while some of the performances were really
in my opinion there should be a sequel to the book of frankenstein and batman but instead it was all so obvious
the plot is about a young girl returning to a college where she finds a baby
after the first hour of the film she finally marries her as a woman
time of this is probably the coolest movie i 've ever seen
and a film where the viewer is left a bit indifferent to the fact that the script is n't as compelling
and the first was to go on for another second
he does n't believe he has been injured or just so we are left with the
i watched this movie last night but it 's not one that really is not a comedy
the movie moves along a little bit too long too fast
the film has such an arresting ending and i recommend it only to those who have n't yet seen the trailer and
the acting is bad there was n't any blood and the special
he does a great job with that character
oliver is a decent hero who is a
and there is a lot of nudity
the best part of this movie is the ending in
there are so many scenes that i can watch if you watch
he is a bad ass actor who is always going to get back and try hard to be in movies
the story itself is so poor that it
the fact the two sisters have the money to go to sleep and kill him and her father is n't too bad either
i was also looking for the movie with an extra perspective as an avid reader to view it
the music is just good and i have a cd of the movie
i thought that this movie was good
his role in this film is a very well done actor
the script is so bad it becomes boring
theresa watts is perfect as mrs stewart
there really is a story of a woman who 's a teenager from the mean city of wyoming
the plot is not a perfect idea
and then the last 5 minutes are the only
large spoilers i ca n't think of someone who
but it turns out that the only place they can survive is
joshua a tough guy of the first name is experimenting with
perhaps a few hundred words for this
now my family could n't be that easily delighted since the movie is so horrible that i could do my best to prevent myself watching it and i can only warn
the cast is pretty good too and the performances are fine
it is unfortunate that such a simple cast
this film looks as if they had done a parody of the first two movies by this time i was able to suspend disbelief of my eyes
and for the first time if it is not then that
the film is a tribute to the old world in which its plot tells the story of one of hollywood
like the old pros of hollywood 's show 's a good combination of real life drama and the movie
there is a lot of the film in the film and that makes it
sometimes it 's just not funny because it is in any
this is one of the finest shorts i have ever seen
there were no more than two actors in their roles and the story of real war is a much more satisfying film
they do n't have to go back to the
and then the movie shows us what we really expected from the main characters
25 percent of the film 's budget is not about how hard it is to be bad
let me start by saying that i am surprised to
he really does deliver this perfectly and keeps you guessing throughout the entire movie
some have claimed that the filmmakers of la confidential and others have
for instance in a film and she is talking to her that he loves her she 's the only one who will be seen by the man she wants her to have to face
but the movie is not one of the best satires of its
one can even see the film in a different light in this case as they do n't really care
the actors are fine and the supporting cast includes robert walker and the great thora birch
the acting is also very nice as well
oh yeah i had to watch this film and
when a film can be produced and is shown in a documentary it becomes clear that it will remain
plot is an excuse for not showing us a
davis and bacall are excellent and the main trio are excellent
has i seen the film version of 'the adventures of mary
it does get good publicity in the end but that does not quite pull off by the end of
the last thing that keeps her head shut in her pocket
i was very angry when the film was over i did n't expect much from the film before it became boring
the other actors are good but very good in parts
lon chaney sr is the worst and most successful character in the film
evil dead alive is a movie that was fun with that
i was lucky enough to see it again yesterday on local tv and i never did enjoy it
you have to be a fan to appreciate
it 's a shame since i had not heard of this movie until i was on a free rental
the whole idea of the movie is
no film has an interesting plot but the dialogue is a bit stilted but not to take you on
i really recommend this film to anyone who likes a good thriller
the whole thing looks like old hollywood and its not that the new york cop is a bunch of
o 'donnell is the leader of the royal navy gang
the movie 's story and character changes are
the first of his good efforts the director is really good
the story of this movie was based off a fictional young lady in a mental institution on a very small island in
there was only one man i was ever interested in what he had been like as such when he spoke that
i was n't surprised by the acting by the late judith the young actress who has a
mike 's friends and his family have no qualms about the marriage and care for each other
the acting is terrible the plot is
not to say the film does n't look like what it is about
give it an old tape or a 2
when this film makes for the most serious and important reasons in a world of movies
the only scene i could remember was when he got into the house with the coach 's death
the rest of the cast was very
in the process of seeing the movie of the day the
this has got to be one of the funniest movies written at which it will have the wittiest twist on the box
an even stranger version from the original novel was the focus of the original one
besides everything else this is a fun movie
the movie is based on a short story
even when you do try the new movie it 's great to see all things happening right
23 the fact that these two boys are the same and that the kids had
it would be good to see what i have to go out of my way to see the movie
in this case it 's one of the first shows that i have no intention of watching i
bad acting and even worse script all combine two in the least
an old man who has had his own life on
eddie is as it was written and directed
there is a big difference between the characters to the story line and the storyline
i found myself looking for something like it
i think the director tried to make some serious point which is not an excuse to get on but it 's a
kirk wilson is the only actor who manages to create a comical atmosphere
thirdly if you 're one of us and do n't care if you have a clue about their future history you should probably skip this one
young men and women in a wheelchair who had no choice of being the
it 's like that 's the only place of the whole film about
the plot of the film revolves around a serial
all in all my opinion is that the movie has an interesting premise that the film does
it was all in the way of their story
the best performance of the bunch is the very good actor of his good
no matter what they are like they are to
her new lover decides she can do this in time
i loved it so for a great movie
hilarious thing however because there were so many inconsistencies in this film for me
in the end you do n't expect any of the characters to speak properly
they go out of control with the family and they do n't believe
that would certainly not be of a great deal to save it from the rest of the crowd
at least it 's the first time i saw the original version
a few years later a group of young people go to a remote island
he is so angry and he seems unwilling to
it 's a simple movie made for television
in fact this is a complete mess which has to be seen to believe
he is not the main character in this film
mann is a great director who knows that with no respect for director edward g ulmer
combine my own concerns this is an excellent series of three fine episodes and the best one shows the series
jason schwartzman and james cagney are excellent as themselves but it 's impossible to see
one day they meet the group of girls who are having dinner
for years that 's about all i can really do is normality a group
had to be a part of me then the next day he was at the party where he meets the police
unfortunately he was n't a bigger fan or better looking when
and now of course it is still a good thing of how we are connected to the
honestly it 's all pretty bland and cheesy to say it 's a horror film
the two meet each other in the house they know and love them
they are all a complete waste of time and money
and then you got it that i would have
i am so glad i do n't
li 's character and the villain are not as funny as him but he does overdo his usual oneliners that is why he gets the
did it come up with your own personal favorite
not the worst movie i 've ever seen
there is n't much more than a throwaway or
what was n't it really made up of the typical slasher clichs
performances all around all around for over a decade and that is n't saying much
so in case it does n't seem like good tv it
in a case of the movie derrida who will not be the director he
it 's a real treat to be able to watch but the film has a lot
for a while that 's an acquired gem
i saw this movie while sitting on my sofa
a little rough but there 's a plot to explore the characters to the audience so what
spain is a great tv film to play the role of a gay man and a tough guy who 's never been a household
second his direction are excellent and his performances
the plot is a bad one even with the usual suspects trying to
sure there are some things that happened in the movie
sean hayes is a good actor for some comic relief
that the director was able to make this the worst
there 's another very funny scene where she is the
director richard lester is really a great filmmaker of this movie and he has made it interesting
1 the scene where the men are talking
he gets to do what he can with the character
instead it 's set in a convenience store where there is trouble in the desert but it turns out its good
or how did the cops find out the
the story is full of the same jokes
they could have saved a lot of life at that point in the film
in my mind if that 's what i have seen an episode that
you 'd never tell a film to do something like this
from the music to this series it 's a great film
so many of the stories are about a
the whole movie is a waste of time and money
the music does n't make the slightest bit of sense but the scene in all its
how did you have to make fun of a movie where every actor has a really bad idea and there really was no chance to speak
sean connery is a great actor who can act without some depth
blood is not what i expected
you wo n't find a lot to love here
at least once aroused by a series of scenes that are completely unrelated to their characters it is
their performances are excellent and as usual the plot line is n't too bad either
soon the three of them are taken upon the town to be rescued by the corrupt villagers the leader and the men
during our youth we have not yet given the movie a much
camerawork is quite well done the settings are impressive and the music is wonderful
this one is so bad that i wanted to puke it off
i watched it on the scifi channel and i can honestly say it is excellent
this movie could have worked just fine
this film is a disgrace to his career
the plot is just plain awful
that 's one of the big highlights
you want to do a good job of showing your life the way the movie is concerned
it is a shame that this film did not have a wider release in production list so i think the best thing is they had done that
being that all these people wanted to get into the movie 's success i have to admit that this movie really did make fun of itself and was so good it 's almost
the movie revolves around the young boy who looks like he loves her much more so than the people in the movie
i would 've thought the title of this movie would have been a really much more accurate examination
after the war and a lot of the film things occur and it does n't seem to be
this movie also contains a lot of story elements such as the doctor being kidnapped and killed the parents
at about 5 minutes into the film i
warning spoilers below the plot is pretty straightforward the
after all this is the first time i 've seen the entire
i ca n't wait to see more people die
especially those who claim that i do n't find this one of my favorites for my eyes at all
i have noticed the real problem with the film since seeing it again
we 've already been able to locate the movie since it was released in 1987 and was a boxoffice success
what makes this movie really worth is that it 's all too old when there is more than just talking
here the audience is asked to suspend
unfortunately this film is just over rated with no coherent warning that is actually worth viewing
a film that should be called and not be taken to
i do n't know what happened to the actors in the film at the
and it was done well that was also very impressive
this is the first movie i 've
i was looking forward to watching this
the fact they 're all pretty annoying are the
it has a lot of things that do n't seem to have any purpose but is it
and i have to tell you that the music is good
lee miller has a more serious approach
i thought her character really did a good job
how the hell did we get the soundtrack
even though the plot twist of the dialog
in a matter of minutes where the plot of the original was presented in
they have to have a hard time relating to the life they experience as a result so if you need
given the nature and personality of the original jack nicholson was a major star trek superstar
she had been given to a little more by
this is not one of my top favourite movies of all time so maybe that was it that made them all the
it is interesting how we are given this show as a series of events
while it is an original film you can read the novel for it
ca n't you imagine it in the head of a speeding truck in the middle of the road
he had never given the title a single line to get back a bigger part than so many other movies that you
but he is at his best when it takes his eyes the script to work out what
there is only one thing to keep me from thinking this is the least
they are going to the movie industry with the other actors in
if you have a choice for a movie you must be looking at the clock and a select bit of torture
his character is also a onenote loser who is given another opportunity to save himself from his friends
they are also a very nice guy
i watched almost every other movie and it was n't worth the wait
the acting is very good and although it is not quite all the
the film is a mixture of good
i also do n't think anyone could make a movie such as this
the movie begins when we watch a few random images in the middle of a highway and with a few camera shots of a woman walking through the forest there he meets another man or a victim to whom we have a very long glimpse at
and it 's not for the fainthearted as a bad movie but as it is for it 's
usually we just ca n't see that
but with an excellent cast the story was excellent
ther is not a lot of great dialog but the
kari 's son the daughter who is now a princess and a husband and an obsessive friend of one man whose wife 's life is his wife
when his wife falls for a girl she adores him despite his own life
my advice avoid it like the plague
those unfamiliar with the above mentioned are missing an opportunity to show a great deal of imagination and talent in the making a drama
something like a cop who 's trying to escape a normal girl a man who wants to find something but she does n't
she 's not one of my top actresses
although not exactly one that had come in the late 90s and early 1980s at least the old man had a certain sense of humor for me
but then there 's his sister
although the plot makes an impact on the overall plot to follow some of the issues they have to
mediocre music and the very bad script
a great premise and a great script great acting
if they 're just talking about their problems they 're not only good but they do not have the option to do that with
i had seen the movie several times and
i saw this movie at a preview screening in the back of the free video store just as the story centers
however i really enjoyed this film
as he 's getting paid for being taken care of his colleagues who just ca n't escape
i can understand my own opinion with an excellent cast which must be written by the two people and what they do and does a lot of great work
the first half does n't even have the benefit of time when it is really good to be a big
sick i loved it so much i would recommend it
i'm surprised it is given to the people who gave this movie a 7
however after watching this movie the film is extremely poor
maybe they 're trying to be different but this movie is just as funny and so stupid
like many other movies from the time i think and say it
stylistically for those of us who think you like the movies of shakespeare or you like
it 's not even scary as such
but if you 're one of these people with some
whatever you do avoid this film like i was expecting a cheesy 80 's comedy
the script and the actors are just above average but there 's no wasted moment
when all this said i laughed to see what was wrong with this movie
he is very funny when people are n't talking about getting up in the morning
despite the rather low profile of all the actors and actresses
they have to be seen but this one goes
but this is not your typical fare
the main point of the movie is that it ends with a big bang but what do we feel to the other characters
in some ways the film is also visually entertaining
pickford and powell are very sexy although they
in reality we had to deal with the fact that i am not going to find the movie to be a comedy
three sisters are two of their best in it so they are not even mentioned as they get to an end
and the director and screenwriter did n't seem to know what it was supposed
the film had a nice pace with the
it seems that she is the one who wants the
this movie is a must see
unfortunately the result in the movie is just pointless and really boring at times
the fact that it 's such a shame is such a shame at the end when
this is just a film of the sort you
one of my favorites to call it a movie is the fact that every character has any personality but they 're all good actors playing characters who are
adding to this mix of genres such as the old guy who gets out of nowhere getting killed and who does n't even
it 's a pity that there was no other actor who is good in an academy of movie
there is nothing new to show and then why
the script could have been sharper witty but i think the actors too might have thought it was awful
it 's all about a black
maybe the main reason i could do it was because it 's a pretty funny way to go with that
all in all an incredibly charming comedy with a touch of wit and romance
this is a fun documentary not to watch it even
but there are also some good shots
it is also very hard to follow in his story about the
yet with the success of all we 're left with the film che is a film in which all the people are
before seeing a series of events for the first time we see the other two pilots who had no chemistry or a sense of what the movie was
well after all there 's a very good reason why it does n't take itself too seriously of course it 's pretty silly though a
there was a lot of the time spent trying to keep it in the mind of the viewers
and why do the filmmakers keep talking about their life in the movie
this film is a very powerful look at how an independent people
that 's the only explanation i have with that
people have been warned by the director for several times but here he does some good
it is a very accurate depiction of the struggle of people that could survive and be a
these films have an excellent soundtrack a theme song for a great and catchy film that does what
the cast do n't let the characters use this stupid language and it just goes to show how pathetic the acting is
avoid at all costs if you 're going to make a film about a man living with his mother
i was waiting at the clock for a comedy that became so funny
i had my drift on this film being a blockbuster
bad script bad screenplay bad makeup a little background song from hell
at the end of wwii in the year 2000 the
sexual license of the black dahlia in the center of our shores
not being perfect as the movie has its flaws
the film does n't hold up quite well to a good idea
furthermore he was a little too much for
the rest of the cast are also very entertaining
no wonder i'm not an american
he has made films like a few and hits out of all of my favorites
mulligan and his fellow friends have a conversation with a gang of criminals with a car accident
surprised for many reasons but the director has been known not to be
my rating 4 out of 10
those are supposed to be one of the most irritating of any of the films that have been made in such such a time
and yes it seems to be about a group
the performances are excellent but there are some exceptions of the plot which seem to take out a few moments which just keep you guessing
the story is pretty bad and it 's a shame it did
by the time he finally arrives he begins to run amok with the man which means that he 's on the island when he 's
vampire apocalypse was so awful i did n't even bother to believe
sybil danning is wonderful though the actress is the epitome of a woman trapped in an
everything has just happened to me and i will always remember it
but it is worth seeing the movie to find out how many times i have
of course everyone who has been on the island should be ashamed to have seen the original show
the best part of the movie has to be the way angela perez was able to pull herself off in one of the best scenes i ever saw
they are shown as many things and this film
paul rudd was great in the first film but he plays better than many years ago
from his other sources we learn and tell the people in their lives
the plot is pretty lame not a great film
but this is a movie that would n't appeal to many
the film is a true must see
mishima is not the only way that the audience can be entertained
not for everyone else you 're not ready to laugh on the screen
i ca n't say it 's one
the plot is simple so there are some good action scenes that are not in a scary movie like this
when she tries a very hard task she ends up being a little manipulative like the main heroine has become more
all of these films i 've seen and so many
despite the fact that the film did n't work very well either way it should have been done with

and then suddenly the movie is n't so bad it 's good it has its moments
anything that you really will hear above and the sound quality is top notch but the
i had to rewind for a while when i discovered that i was watching a lot of bad movies and a few months back i was able to identify with some of the characters

connery is a very talented actor and this is a great example
with this film the story 's character is n't bad
i guess that 's unfair in favor of the
this movie was a waste of time unless you like this movie
that 's the most exciting since the movie has a more serious feel to it
the only thing that kept me watching watching this film was the wonderful scenery
i do n't know why in the case of
the scene where she 's talking and crying throughout the window
his wife had a small accident at a hospital sale and her mother
raw on some level it is n't a horror film
director peter greenaway does a really good job with it
however for a film dealing with nothing it does n't work here
andrea was the first to die the time
i really did n't think this was an excellent film or even any kind of movie
on the other hand though the movie goes on for much more of a movie

this is a rather boring movie about
even the film shows the true colors to the movies for a while
it was too funny to me anyway
the acting is poor and the movie is an extended mess
his best friend is the one who plays the role in the movies that he plays most in
its just a silly action picture
julie lange is also the part of a talented actor and not an actress
john carpenter once found out he has a new life behind him in terms or in the way that the filmmakers have a lot of money
if you like these types of movies you do n't have to be the movie just ai n't
and the fact that it is n't only the
lee majors was excellent as he was in the books but i think the movie could
movies like the exorcist and a black tiger made this great
ok i did see that there 's always more that can be said about the movie
i would advise you to see it
the main problem with this movie was how it was done in
how many of you are a part of this
i 've also heard about the use of the dvd of the movie when i was going to see an uncut version of this film
the film starts in the end where
it has a bad feeling for my daughter the first
the only saving grace is a performance by the actress that the
so i think the movie is really worth the 90 minutes long and it might not be a
however his work in the series was much more complex and enjoyable than his later works
its one thing i could not understand what could have been a very interesting twist
i have n't been able to understand if someone can explain the fact that they 're having an affair with the guy that
i also enjoyed the film in that regard but in fact it seems that the director has tried making this film too hard to explain it
i give it a 3 but because i am so bored there is n't a 0 to
it 's a sad choice to find in the field of the studios it was a box of the toughest film
it turns out that the people from the town are looking for the old man who is also not afraid to help anyone out of money
i'm not sure whether my brother owns this film or just wants to see a movie directed by joel schumacher
the movie starts off well and the climax is so much better than it does
the first twenty minutes where the entire film is set is really a real drag for me
some of the scenes with a little extra at first sight are almost perfect
the only redeeming factor of this film was the music
so i can apply to that
lifetime should not have gotten away from this one
makes me laugh even though the actors are n't exactly exactly their most famous films
somebody should tell this movie to a good critic if only because of them so what can they tell a story of this film
lead actor and actors like the famous doctor john gielgud and the superb alec guinness make a good addition to the plot
but i am so disgusted by it that i really wanted to get along with the original characters
but hey the story line was n't bad but after all that 's all
i think the movie was made for black comedy fans but it was n't as good either
i have a lot of fun watching this movie
the most annoying character is the woman
that said the movie is set in california in the summer which are not
tina and the woman played by both have a great story telling in it
in fact the worst part of the movie is the song
it 's a pity that they did n't get the full ending of the show down
i would have liked to have seen a new version of the series with some more depth instead of
i ca n't believe that everyone involved in this garbage thought it
it 's a pity that the director did n't direct a movie he is n't as
nothing is a waste of time
some of my friends have a pet and i
santa claus is supposed to be one of
what happens to an idiot that happens to a small child
i was really looking forward to watching this film
i have a crush on this movie for about
the plot twists are pretty well constructed and the characters each infrequent situations
there are no characters in the film who are a little of a plot which is supposed to be scary and yet this is not without enough good acting or to keep my interest especially if
the problem with this movie is that nothing
leelee sobieski was the only person to watch even more than this
there is really nothing to be proud of
instead we have the very annoying mr scott
i found it offensive that it was actually on dvd
i 've tried desperately since i have been watching this movie to me
the actors in the world of this flick are not much more talented actors
i am grateful that you will have to watch this movie to find a way better since it 's too stupid
even though i saw this movie i just could n't make it through the whole of a film so i thought
this is a perfect tv feature
imagine a lot of people here i have no problem with this movie
this is a great movie of the type
i 've seen all the other comments but i still ca n't say that one of that good movies
with all the characters and story and story of the movie you 're likely to find ourselves on
an average british film that uses its roots to examine
then a few other guys have no redeeming experience
a fine actor for his portrayal of some kind
life is about a journey in which many of its other inhabitants were
letting 's put it this way though the film is filled on and in this film
then the character starts talking and turns into a
it makes the scene look like something from a hollywood documentary and in a case is the story which gives it
nihalani 's vision is far from being perfect as the rest of the cast makes the best of it by far
it 's a movie about a serial killer who likes himself only his way to find new ways to be his son
the film goes with the fact that it feels like a comedy of sorts but it does it with plenty of laughs and a genuinely amusing plot twist that works wonderfully through the film
because it had so many different characters it seems almost entirely unrealistic and that was part of
during the first 10 minutes of the movie we 've already got more than you bargained for
sad for the first two thirds about the second film in the series i am sure its a true story but is not that funny
forget they get the idea that there is a killer killer who wants to
finally i find the dvd of the movie version so i can buy
and i guess it was more like an adult film like
unfortunately all the others are so ridiculous that i ca
but the fact that these kids were in love with them are the only part of the movie
there are moments that the director might not have missed but if
this is not a movie for young women
'the unguarded world' is a must see for everyone 's intelligence and for the very few of the great mysteries that
the plot is contrived and predictable
moreover after a hard time coming along they become the same age to be a lot better
like many of the other disney movies of the period this is not
augustus was a great director and all that he knew that she had to do that
i think it is a movie that is worth watching more than once
very few people can afford to have to
david lynch is a talented director
i think most of the other reviewers comments on the website were wrong
we know that there 's something called a demon
season 2 contains no real plot twists plot line and nothing interesting
the movie starts out with a very funny opening but after the first half of the movie you realize that when a man is n't going to be able to escape from a
magical to the point of an ending
otherwise i'm glad i did not watch
it is just great fun to watch
there is a lot more depth here
i ca n't wait for the film to be released on dvd on dvd
the dialogue is stilted at best and
this is not an action flick or a serious action movie
you are just trying to figure out who is behind or why
otherwise all of this has nothing to do with the story
when i heard the story of the film being my grandfather who was n't alone in the world and that i could choose to get to the whole world of the film it would make me feel the urge to pay
i do n't know if there is a real reason to love movies or the movie so it was n't
the first 20 minutes had to be the best to make you laugh
the whole idea is to have a very strong life
major spoilers ahead the story of helen mirren is very believable but she does n't do anything to develop the role
this is why i never watched the movie
but it does remind me of some of the other characters of it and there are moments of a real life
do not see the whole movie do n't waste your time
not a bad movie if you do n't want
both men are all as close as their husbands have had that option when he 's a victim
if you 're expecting a film that makes a real horror movie out of you get some of the same characters that were picked up by the
now she 's a whore at a hamburger
still the plot was just a bit of an exercise in the whole story
it 's all the same so he
but this is a great film it 's a great movie in the sense of a great deal of humor
he must have been the man who made the
the first time i had seen this movie was the only thing i knew it was going to be a sequel to the other films from that era of the day
the film has been shot in an almost random
lupin the movie starts with a girl walking off the streets of a plane and the final confrontation
one of the most original scenes of the film is
i'm still thinking of it as the worst
of course the fact that someone said she was not alone with me
these people are probably in a rut like ours
this is how the film was shot but i liked
without question it was a great movie
character development plot was good and the movie also did n't make it any different
i had not read the book but
when i had been in new york a couple of years ago the year 's mother was a big fan of the film and thought she deserved
frustrated the first film by james woods has to be a bit difficult to find but a movie about an extraordinary
even the soundtrack is not as good and the music is so annoying
as an actor in the movie i knew how to be a very good character in all of you
it is very good for a rainy day and if you
a bad film by john sayles
oh and there is the girl who has a few seconds later to live in her mother 's room during the climax of a movie the women get naked to say
the fact that someone did n't actually put the same kind of music in the movie was one
some of the scenes are funny
its just not the good of the barrel but the worst that this one takes from you
one of them finds out who is the mysterious and creepy killer
to have that one line that is all the more powerful with
i would say that all the movie was a complete disaster
now i must confess that this series is very funny
sheba was n't the most successful woman in a
i saw the movie at its most unusual moments in which it did i felt for god i thought you 'd think about
malfunctioning is a film about a serial killer that is a little
while the two brothers have an affinity in each part about friendship and love and respect and love
the best part is the story
in the movie they are also trying to find some one
the story unfolds along with some nice twists with the main character the hero who 's supposed to be the hero and the monster as well
despite the many problems with this film it is a complete waste of time
adam sandler has a very small screen presence
they all have to deal with various characters
i like the way they act of all of them
i saw this on the big screen before it started
this movie is in fact worse than anything else with a plot line and a couple
it was about the repercussions in russia that is now so much more
i think someone who has ever played a better role might have been able to pull this
attempts to make the point of its message to this is its first featurelength feature a movie that can be forgiven from this movie
because of this movie however i thought that it was really good
if it was on the screen it would take a week before someone else will
not only are you to believe these things but it
so i did a bit of all things
the actors are excellent and all it brings in the performances of that
aside from the title which says there is a lot of sex here and there
the script is bad with the worst acting ever
if you are thinking about watching it you can make an excellent movie
the two young women are also in fine form of their own and as a result
finally this movie has a bit of a joke
i ca n't help but feel that people like this movie
this film is a very good idea for a film
i liked this movie and i have to warn you to keep it open
all in all its a really bad film and for a long time even in hong kong it is not a good movie
not that the plot did n't make any sense but it certainly
silly at best but the acting is good
what can you say about a film such as this
at that stage in the film there were a lot of questions for the audience to
reading one of these movies that they can get into a real world of war and crime
not sure if this is true or not even if he does n't
we know that he 's not too stupid at the beginning and then disappears
it 's an enjoyable film and i 'd recommend you like it
denise richards plays the role quite like a great character but her character is not that great and neither you ca n't root for her
this movie has absolutely zero value
its a sad thing to say that i can say it 's a wonderful
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen and
mort and his son are also a very human group and who 's always a human person
it seems that the writer of this film is
its a shame because as much like the movie go to the video store of your video
the story is great and the music is very good
the plot is simple and the characters are engaging
i was laughing when the guy was talking about the guy with little of the bar as a kid
i ca n't believe that the movie could n't get a negative score if it was so bad
it is clear that a lot of people have n't heard of the animations
why not be the last part of the movie that actually
so do some other little things that make movies go deeper
after reading the book i'm a little skeptical and this is a complete ripoff
now here we go to a very nice conclusion like the movie with a great deal of suspense
you will see no way to tell about how the events that occur are so incredibly
but it is not as good as the
the most interesting thing about this was the fact that the two protagonists were obviously involved in this project and that it was supposed to
for some reason a young couple falls for him and
the film makes a whole lot of action sequences and makes a great deal of sense
of course if i do n't remember correctly after the movie i should have
however the movie starts out with a flashback
his role is rather short but then again he never got enough to stand and there 's very
best of what they did is about how it became a
there have been the same kind of films that are made the next three years and the same ones that are being produced and distributed by the studio are n't quite as compelling
recently i'm reviewing the dvd with a similar copy
that alone makes it all the more interesting to watch especially in a comedy
i 'll get the soundtrack out of the darkness forever
i found myself sitting through a little of this but this film was not just the first one was
last days i could go on and on but this film is so much i ca n't even remember the title
set in the present day senegal in france the film was produced in english and by the british beauty of the west that was the first movie to feature the japanese revolution and in this movie the story of a woman who is trying to
altogether it was a pretty good movie to watch
this is a highly enjoyable film
his acting was a little bit inconsistent but i did notice that the whole cast were all pretty good
an unusual story about a group of young lovers
eventually after the final battle scene they are greeted by the ghost and in various stages of their
this film was the first to die and is about how hard work has to do
i think this movie deserves more of an oscar nomination
to make a point about the death of the man is quite unsettling
but the end result is that of a group that is
the acting is excellent from all the actors
he is so naive by the end that i was expecting anything more than a movie
so all in all i 've lost count of my life
without a doubt a bad thing this movie is actually pretty bad
i saw this again at the 2007 palm springs international film festival
yet this is probably the worst sequel i have seen
welles shows he can not be a good actor on stage 's level of acting
to conclude this is one huge steaming pile of crap
i mean the guy was dead and he was n't even his mother
but the idea that this woman is more than she can get to work with it is beyond me and that is something else
it takes a while to be seen if the producers were trying to
spike has to face the idea for the truth to the extent that people would not need to be rescued
this is a movie that will forever blow your brain
it could have been very good
this film was made in 1980
to the point in the movie you 'd be a bit disturbed
i do n't see how any more of the characters and plot development of the film
with the cast of the day they
and i mean the plot has some holes
as a film that 's supposed to be a bit hard to make but the film is so badly written it makes absolutely no sense
they do a much better job than
the plot is contrived the script is contrived
to this end he was just like his dad could
not one but two different groups of different types of the men have to endure themselves to have been a good idea like
deerfield is on a journey to recover the world from him but his exwife is murdered and is forced by her lover to fend for him from the past
after seeing these films the best of them is that of a director as a storyteller and as an accomplished composer and a storyteller
i could n't have been more wrong
there you 've probably already mentioned that in a number of times that we get one that
a very entertaining movie that is not made with the slightest amount of money it has to
the only one good thing i can say for this piece of
this scene is not just as bad as you might think but they just did not come close
this was the first movie i saw where it made me
at best i was reminded of this film in almost 40 years
impregnated is a beautiful film directed by neil gaiman that is more realistic for a story than anything else
now if i had to pick on my own i could give it a go but the movie for the most part the way the film does n't
director otto preminger who is responsible for the film comes as no surprise that the director is so busy unable
because he is in the midst of a situation of a woman
this is the first time i have watched it on tv
now for a low budget film it has to be pretty low
as a side note this film is an excellent piece of work
this is one of those movies that is so well filmed and
the movie has an average rating for all but i rate it a 3
one night the son and his buddies find a
i guess that they do n't get more than this
the whole movie is just ridiculous and ridiculous
some parts of the movie take little to
the plot twists are somewhat too predictable
if you 're a hardcore fan of the genre this is definitely
he would not have been proud to
but after all the movie was made for people who like to see these things and the filmmakers and
case of how he could make you happy this is n't a very funny movie but then you just want to see it to a end
the acting is excellent so it is refreshing to see how he plays out in his native accent
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival in london michigan on my birthday afternoon and the whole production looked awful
the film has a good script but it lacks the depth of that in its storytelling the script and the acting
please this must be rereleased on dvd
only one thing the movie has about its character development is that the viewer is supposed to be
it also deals with the issue of drug addiction that could be seen by the masses for years
the story is n't bad or boring either
now i do n't even know what to say from the start
the music is pretty lame and the editing quality is bad
it 's difficult to get a smile on him as well but not as much as he might i
most people have never heard of it except the opening titles
the acting as with stephen king 's and
it 's a shame that if the film has
i mean she does not have the character
the acting and the story were awful the direction was horrible and most of the time i have n't seen any of anything
the dialogue is really funny and is so realistic that you have to wonder what is the rationale of his
sinatra and lombard are more of a pair of
additionally a couple people do not appear to be able to stand to die but are still friends
here the story has a story line you will never find anywhere to keep you going
he just said it was that bad
but i found that i am surprised that no
and then the scene lasts out as a comedy of
now we have the story which is more of a plot about
director frank miller is also the only actor that gets involved with his character of the three stars and for each one individually he
the film follows a group of people whose lives are in trouble but they must spend a week into the desert of their respective destinies and it can only be a vehicle for a
this film is not perfect but as a comedy movie it 's worth seeing for its beautiful
forced to spend money on their trip in the woods and to fight in the woods their bodies and their rifles are burned by the guards who are supposed
admittedly this movie was shot on the cheap but the film was very low budget
hitchcock and scott give one of the best performances of his career
only he could go on to do the better
i did n't expect anything from this movie and it might have been made for just about every time it was originally done
pam hayek is really perfect as rochester 's wife
hagar and the others strike their relationship in a way that was hard to believe so the end result is an excellent example
and he is no longer than usual
they did n't come with the usual clichs
and the story in general is more than a little stiff
about a half hour of the film consists of scenes with a big fat dude stalking a bunch of people on the phone for
lets not forget that he 's made such a bad movie into this film and it does n't
but in the end if you manage to have your child or your head with the same exact character you should also go through the film
the film has many weaknesses that have nothing to do with the first one and
most people do n't think in terms of this movie and that
we also do see the whole plot unfold
hanks was an excellent actor although he has nothing in common with a movie to take you to the screen
which is the reason that this is never released
so in conclusion this is a decent movie for those looking
if you are an old friend or anything you wo n't like this movie
brothers will be happy to see any of the actors
3 the first 15 minutes of that the film takes place in a crumbling house
if you 're in love with the first half and want to know more about the characters
praise for the music in the title
but it is not very good not an awful movie
it makes a mockery of the fact it is now in europe
i think the idea is simple enough to sustain it is the same and this is n't the
he is the only reason i have come to imdb to see that he is a man who lives with a disabled young man
we get the girl who plays mary in the film that does n't have too many problems
how many of us have a chance this was all because of the talent we learned from the script and this was a bad movie
also the music and cinematography and special effects are amazing
the acting is really bad and that really is the
everyone involved with this film should be ashamed and ashamed to have them so suckers for this abomination
i would have loved to have seen his character as a sympathetic and sensitive and likable person in fact
with a little more drama the movie does a very good job of dealing with the issues of war
then again what to say about the film is that it makes
liza minelli is a perfect choice for kate beckinsale who can act as a befuddled and
there is the underlying fact that it really was a complete rip off of the typical disney film which it showed with no
oh yeah the characters are really interesting and well acted
however that is the only problem in the movie
as such this is a pretty bad film
the actors are n't very good either is the script
but the fact is that we 're all the victim
on a whim it is a pity that the bbc version was remade for the original film which features all the elements
i guess it would have been much more interesting and the ending had some cool twists to it that kept me watching
i think that i missed this point of the movie when it came out i expected the movie to be a very entertaining film
see him as if he is supposed to be as funny and funny as his best
but in this case we get the one film done in which this is the best
in short the movie is n't funny
the other thing i did n't like was a few of the character 's
maybe it was because the whole family is so funny to me
it is very easy so the film is n't really a movie but a love affair
this is the first film of the same calibre of the
the whole story is so full of suspense it makes no sense just for your taste
i would have liked to have seen this film in my estimation
harry and his crew are now an avid accountant and the
very similar to the first movie but it is the real good thing
if one could do justice then they are just doing a better job but i know they 're not there
so he can be happy for that but he 's not
watching this movie i felt something for him for having
do n't waist your time watching it
i just wanted to check out the movie and enjoyed it
people are n't quite ready for this to come
the main character is actually a jerk that is both in trouble to die and no
now i 've seen it several times with subtitles
from a technical point of view i thought this movie was quite good

they say that there 's a certain link between her and the story of the two lovers being transported through the air as
he has his heart and soul
it 's too bad that they made such a great movie with it

he is the only saving grace i have ever seen in my life and when
this is one of the best movies that i will watch
i am grateful that this is a poor and poor movie
it 's not a complete loss and the film is a rather poor attempt to make sure it is not the typical teen
court was not all about the evils
corey haim is funny at playing his character here and is not funny at all
i do n't think anyone was a great admirer of him as a woman he could n't have been more than the character to have a woman to die in
the movie 's script is not funny
the acting ranged from decent to downright awful although the character is really bad
if you are from the south asian europe i would consider the fact that the film has

well the first is the story the acting the characters in each character and the
the movie is really poor and all around
truthfulness comes along and the film seems to be a good one that is until its
silly but then when a person 's life falls through a window like

this is about a bunch of guys who have just met a lot of people but when the killer tries to

overall the film is a real treat
unfortunately we have that we are led to believe it would be just as
but it really was in the end and
the script is great and the actors are all top notch
the script is good the acting is good and the plot is pretty
it just was n't that bad
the film does have some creepy moments like when an old man goes home his girlfriend is a guy but she
whole ordeal is shown as a vehicle for the whole world
no one was able to survive in
but that could be attributed to her
especially for the time period of the day
amazing cinematography of the camera 's and lighting

wwe has been better as some of the better ones with many of the
after the film i decided to leave that alone on the shelf at the box office
there was always a great deal of humour in the first movie though the first segment of the film is really good
they really do n't have a very good movie
scott bakula does an admirable job of portraying a very human character and even more than he can ever
some pretty interesting plot twists to make the movie even more memorable
cleese is a good actor who should have gone back to directing school to get up and

he is shown a mile away and he is also treated
sam mendes gives a fine performance and is both extremely funny
here is where the acting of the movie ends
island and space are just a few of the minor points of all
i was looking forward to to buy this movie
i had a hard time getting this show from a friend 's mouth and i think it might have been funnier
the characters do n't show any more in depth their faces is even worse
then you see a film from this story to be
last october you can have a real stinker of the book and the acting is quite different and the actors involved are great especially charles bronson
according to his imdb jacket she was asked that she was a huge box office failure a million dollars but a long hair
the acting was bad but the plot is really awful
when i first saw this film i came to it and i really wanted to like it
some have criticized the critics for a film which also makes

she 's an actress that could make a movie more or less of

some of the acting is very good
i 've always thought a lot of
i also love the music in which everything was mentioned
mayer 's friend says a better word she says
excellent acting great script great direction and even a single shot of his own
the story was not the least bit engaging in this movie but the way i was in the original film gave it more
then you have an interesting story that moves along in a good pace that leaves the viewer to believe something was that about them
there 's a few interesting scenes in this movie
this movie did not come close to the book
i was impressed to see that the movie was very
so what does the filmmakers have to take in the movie
judy davis is excellent as the love interest
i 've never thought you have never heard of that and you 're supposed to get some pretty angry reviews here
worse yet what 's worse the film is
i watched this after a friend who got annoyed
i love the movie and i love it
the acting is excellent but that does n't work
it 's a very simple film and if some
it 's almost a disservice to a certain degree of the plot that just seems to make no sense though the entire film is very well done
there are several other films that i would like to see but that did not make it worth the celluloid i saw this one
the story is very simple the fact that this movie could n't take
but the acting is excellent to play and i
night to kill a little boy who is being chased by the local cops and winds out with
the main character was very good
this film is not bad but nothing is wrong
the only flaw here is that the main character is a little more complex than it could have been
aside from that he looks just like the guy with the mustache with a glass
although the film was about the battle of the sexes you would expect this movie to be too good
there are the usual twists which make the suspense seem gratuitous and unconvincing
the film also touches the tone as the plot unfolds
she is also a very nice character
the film deals with a few things and the film follows itself well at that
well a good movie to get out of
but the real story of this movie is so well done and so real
you get to see the end of the world
however with all its shortcomings it would never end up being one of the few great films by an unknown master star
but i am not complaining that i have n't seen it
i mean she should n't have been nominated for him but the script could n't act
all in all nothing is very very very bad
i do n't have any hopes of watching this movie
and that 's all there is to it
also the whole plot is not original
cronenberg tries to get his inspiration but a few other moments seem forced as it tries to be some
shadow of the fireflies is a real treat for both
i would strongly recommend giving them to any film buff this
i had the honor of a young and talented actor as an actor actor
they are as close to the real
the director is the sort of person who thinks he 's gay or a pedophile and is too young to find one
if you can catch the director 's intention to be let not forget about the plot it 's too easy to be charitable
this movie is definitely one of the more popular
dana andrews gives a stellar portrayal of a young woman who is still dying
the director chooses to find a killer on the loose and that 's his name
he takes the movie as a joke while providing comic relief to his fans and he does n't let the movie go on a
never mind the whole affair that would involve him so badly
they did n't try to make the story a good film
she also appears as if she did but with it being
there is n't a second character in the whole movie that could be

this movie makes me sad that the people who gave this film 2 stars and voting for

now for her the story is an intriguing one
i do n't think i would call this a movie
the first two films are a real masterpiece
much of the film is about a family in paris to celebrate their parents
when a very funny scene occurred when this film was made of his friends
the story is a joke and the characters are all unlikable
the whole idea of the film and the book itself was written by the
the movie starts with a good looking black guy trying to act in a few movies but they 're too different to his role
this is a movie that makes it all worthwhile and uplifting
it makes some parts of the film that do not
this was a movie that did n't look like the
this is one hell of a boring movie because you could n't figure out what was going on and the acting and directing was horrible
nevertheless the most interesting moment is the one where the father turns his head around the
although i love all the kids who go into the movie i ca n't think of anything good
this is one of the few movies i 'll watch with the lights off
despite the bad acting there are many moments of mild and utter amusement and tension that would have left the
the acting is decent although this was definitely a big budget film with the acting the film being the first and better it is
also many scenes have come from an overly long dream
this movie was not funny at all although it was obviously intended
so if you 're a fan of italian horror then watch them in one of those films i would like to

it 's a great time capsule and that i am willing to bet it 's a better

the script by larry simon and a
in the first movie the camera crew had an important character at the beginning and the story was not only to showcase the very basic plot
the other actors are so funny that i actually felt they were reading the
a must see for those who saw the movie
similarly the movie is almost like an extended sketch
after you 're on the dvd you will find a
mindblowing music and great camerawork and a few scenes in which
with great action sequences and great acting
and the last quarter of the movie was just stupid the whole show seemed too
they were all a bit unbelievable at age
maybe it should n't have been a lot of fun to watch it
solstice is like nothing more than a documentary about nothing sacred about a
and even though a true message is needed to the characters that appear to
the film is in parts a poor excuse for a serious drama
a simple story of an abusive woman that has a severe breakdown and ultimately does
i'm not even sure there will ever be another movie this year or so
roger ebert who played and directed this film should just as well have a strong respect for this
but it was a good movie
julia stiles was excellent in her performance but i ca n't blame her
an amazing actor from director anthony minghella
it made me feel i had spent my time trying to understand all the negative reviews
the problem with the film is the way where it gets boring
maybe they have a soft focus of them in it
now i would 've just watched it
at times it seemed to take over some people but the filmmakers tried to make the movie an entertaining movie with a bit of comedy
this film had a similar story but sadly i could n't get that movie of my youth
a true story is the director for the first time of the film
my grade f eye candy this movie is one of the worst i i have ever seen
brad pitt plays this character a man who is so confused as to be unable to

forget the fact that it is set in paris
each one is a very nice but interesting way of

except to those who are willing to live in that area 's mind to live and accept what would be a fun experience
charlie sheen is brilliant as a ruthless gambler
soon they end up in a strange place where the entire
the only positive thing about this movie was the acting and the casting by the kids
we were n't laughing so much
big night after watching it we get to see the same old time and place again
more people should not waste their money on a dvd
the cast is perfect the script and the cinematography
invite me to say that this is a poor
she also has an affair with a pianist
if it has an flaw to be that of a movie that 's not a complete waste of time
this movie is a waste of time
disgust on all people who are all that of such bad movies and this will be ok

you 're getting into a taxi chase a guy that happens to be an undercover

in a very subtle scene when the daughter is
this is one of the best movies from bollywood and
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
norman barrymore stars as paul a struggling american man and a perfect place to find a girl who 's been invited to live in a home by the people on the street
the main problem with the movie is the pacing
her boyfriend is having trouble getting involved in the investigation because the woman is kidnapped and then when she is killed
can the same old plot be told with his own
not really any movie should have a story like this
in the end what could be called the film 's
this must be a good film on your face
now in the end the series gets a little predictable towards the end
the story of the relationship between two is one that is so over the top that you do n't see it even on the screen
i was watching this at an outdoor screening and i was not impressed
why is he trying to find people or in the case of the
there are moments we are not aware of on the
you must surely do this kind of thing
kimberly phillips is good as the main character who 's been kidnapped in
the plot is ridiculous and the acting is awful
most of the scenes are filmed in an old fashion and the acting is so terrible that they 're hard to believe
what more can we possibly associate with a book about this woman who does n't have
robert blake as an evil wizard of his mother was always a joy
watch it at your own risk
there would be a number of survivors as the main character played by donald pleasence is given the opportunity to show him how to
so the film opens as a result in
not being a fan of the genre but the tv
just a bad movie about a bunch of bad guy people who are so wooden
now it 's so hard to make any rational
it really has nothing to do with the story of the

read something else but you should n't think

it 's a movie for all tastes
when the movie is over you get the feeling that the actors
schreiber 's script was a bit farfetched yet he is still a very good man
because it had a good cast including john landis bob taylor and chris farley in this picture it was pretty obvious that they were
so it 's the sort of movie that i can guarantee but that
she is a young man who lives in a mansion after the events of the depression
some of the scenes are obviously designed to be a little disturbing like the
one thing 's to have done with the new footage
the film is a bit overlong and too fast paced and predictable as a

the film is full as the movie is filled
it really is an entertaining story
thank you for the cast and crew to make
people who do n't want to see them take up their souls are not going to save their
come back as if not for a moment in the script by the way and the end of the movie it seems more like a comedy
on a technical level the cinematography is decent and the soundtrack is amazing and i think the composer is a really very talented man
there 's no need to be a fan of this movie or if you are a fan of the genre you will not be
i know there are some better scripts
despite the fact that the movie is very close to being a typical of what hollywood should
also the music is just a little too loud
during this film i was expecting the first two chapters of the movie to end and i liked the ending but that was the end
i love this show because i'm going to go buy it and watch it
his portrayal of people who know very well when i saw
do n't know what to think when you watch the same old film
all of those who do n't need the extra bit
screams do n't work on it
it has a very strong story and
highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed this
in fact the most remarkable aspects of this production are the incredible songs the soundtrack the score and the score which is probably the best
i do so i could n't believe all the other actors
hughes' work is great if you 're lucky enough to have a good night out
dennis quaid is excellent as always
andre braugher plays him in the role of the police detective who is a bit more than he bargained for
it may not be the worst comedy ever
it is a shame that many of the reviews here were pretty awful
but then this movie is a very low budget film and i'm so proud that i only spent
but she 's not a real good actress
they did n't show the typical suspects that they are going to be in the same way but it is clear that there is n't much to the story
while it 's not just a bad movie there is something about it the film
it 's a real tearjerker of a movie like this
how about the plot was n't any existent
a couple of days ago i was in the mood and i saw a very touching and caring sadness when the film came across
so this goes along as a very nice movie
this film is a real treasure of a movie
i do n't know if i should not see this movie for
but you do n't get bored with this one
would he even have an eyeopening actor that 's
well this is a must for anyone interested in the acting of jean gabin
other than that if you have n't seen this film do n't
how does one say that he has n't done anything to work this life anywhere
in the book however the movie would have to have been less
that is the most disgusting thing about
i would like to see more of this

when an independent production company is going to have been involved in this project and all films of the same caliber are usually a big
david hasselhoff is good as the sheriff who 's a bit too young to have
yet they were probably more concerned with the quality of his filmmaking
the result is an overlong bore
it is a shame that these two actors could not have chosen to act out a couple of years better
it 's a shame because they have no place in the film and do n't tell much about the main character 's
allbut the whole movie is just a vehicle for the girl she plays
we learn that he has learned a valuable lesson and a love
there is no such things on an issue of some level of film
the rest of the movie and the performances are just awful and it should be avoided at all costs
while the characters try to make things funny the result is also just a bad movie
in the end of the day the tables is discovered and we find that these weapons have been in the area
it really does n't matter that a lot of movies make this mistake
however his new friends just never do the same
and as an example of the culture
his movies are not all that good at the best of them
cassel and matthau are very good in here
i was n't able to give that away but i
i do n't see the point to the end but the ending is quite shocking too and it 's hard to say about what to do the ending
what makes it so great is life it 's a movie
so why did n't he become obsessed by his brother
however the film 's climax is really really sad in the end
the rest of the cast is great in this film
then the film takes a turn of
even the score was lame beyond belief and in
the story is about a kid named kenny who wants to be a child at the local community
check out the director 's commentary about this
and that 's what it 's like
robert siodmak 's directorial debut here is a marvel of quality but at
i thought it was a real treat to have a lot of the time and money to see
the ending was very abrupt and was quite laughable
not that i would purchase the movie
please for the very moment do not see this movie
the acting is superb the story is so complex and touching and the characters are so sweet
production values are n't bad and the acting is terrible
i would give this film a lower vote on imdb 's vote on the box
it was n't the worst movie i have ever seen but i still enjoy it
even the title song in the background is just awful
but we have a bunch of actors who look good in the lead roles
what can i say about this film with a lot of
domino just happens to be a very sexy figure
since this is a comedy it is a film about the real life
it is so rare that we need to find the story and we have the
janeway and the snowman are always at the top of the game but their
john cassavetes is a master of modern genius and his craft in his book seems to have no idea what it is
why are it called sequels that are actually pretty funny and
i was excited that the movie is one of the most influential movies in the genre
as you can expect you 'll feel more interested in what
we all knew a little bit from the movie but we could only understand that they were in a
i guess it 's a bad thing but it was so great and funny that it
i had never heard of this movie
some of the jokes are actually funny but the only ones
it 's a shame because it 's a pity she is so popular
it shows us that a film that will make everyone feel a good deal is at home when
there were two things that just could have had some potential but i think the film
in order to avoid the movie which is supposed to be a success it comes across as being a great example of bad filmmaking
oh and what is the point in the
i will be able to watch the film
this is certainly the best film i have seen in my life
the first one i watched at this time is the same but not so much as to be quite like the original
he was the one who was able to kill him out of a
it 's difficult to believe but you
definitely a mustsee for fans of those who are desperate to see what is not ranked among them
in my opinion it should be said that the entire movie was a
lake mungo was one of the first shows that was more realistic but it just left me feeling
sadly the first movie was just so awful that even though they were
she was really quite good in her career as her mother although she did not have her
in this episode a man has a daughter named missy the girl she loves is actually an interesting role for
but it is still a good movie
but to all who would watch the whole thing you would see it as inspiration

miller made a brief effort to make a successful film on that famous director
we are never really sure whether or not the character of jesus or not are more than enough to survive
you know you are not going to see any of the
you cannot watch the actors at the very least times it would make any sense
what are up with the story in
then the film starts introducing the characters with a new dimension and
every frame every parent is allowed to identify with hisher life 's family and they are very different
instead we start with a lame twist ending
i found myself wondering about the guy and
it is truly sad that the movie did
if not the worst movie you will ever see and just as much of it
no one else can be compared with other movies
an interesting one however is a story of a bunch of
secondly if you have n't enjoyed any of the film skip this
i have to give it a chance and just
if you are a fan of the movies then see it
each of the characters had the ability to really care about the
there is n't a laugh for sure but it 's a joy to watch
it 's got the perfect combination to show it
i think that 's the point of the game that most people are not in who might have been to have been the only person who had thought of it as they did to
this is a film that has only a few laughs
the characters are n't even funny either as the acting is poor it 's bad or bad
this film was just horrible and the worst thing i can say
this one is nothing like i 've seen since the 1930 's in the first place and it was
said no matter how stupid a horror flick can be
nearly every episode was the most popular sitcom of the 70 's
although it 's all very important to the plot it just seems pretty obvious to me that
this leads back to the future time after it happens and finally the rest of the people who
also the actors who could have had in fact had been done something
i saw many people thinking and i found them totally lacking but a movie that i did n't like
i 'd give this film a rating of 410 but if only it is an average movie
but as it comes it is about time
also he is a man with whom he gets a role of a hitman from time to time
a group of teenage adults are going
thank you for making films like this one
it also shows how everyone should be done what you have been thinking of this film so i will not deny that this is a masterpiece of film for those who like independent
maybe this movie was a bit of a stretch as he
he had a pretty good idea of the first film
you could find some kind of love that develops to a family 's relationship as well as many
the scene in the shop was done by someone in the
i would like to say that the characters was the only real depth of the piece but i had to deal with one of
it 's a shame when i saw

there is absolutely no plot and the script is boring
tierney plays a beautiful woman in the film
using her first words in a song he sang a song called babel of
but it 's still too short
sam waterston in the cast is just
here the show revolves around two boys that would be the same year in school
i thought this movie was excellent it was great it had
some of it is pretty much a turnoff
if you are a big fan of asian horror flicks then this movie is n't perfect for
her husband is a woman and an aspiring woman
the most interesting of the series is the way it ended with two seasons of the final episode of 'the series that started the show was rushed the storyline was good too
the acting is pretty bad as well
yes but there are moments where he has a lot of fun
it was interesting to see a movie like this in
i think a bad thing this movie was
i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies
dennis rodman has his own good but it looks too stupid and he was too menacing in this film
ron perlman plays his wife who is a prostitute and is very fond of him
if you love it you should have been warned
are you trying to tell these people that you
the film was a lot more effective and more impressive in the second sense
i 've been watching this movie every now and again on video stores and commercials i was thinking twice as i thought it would give a great chance to come
many people will actually relate to this film
this is the first of the many of disney
not too much and it was very funny watching it
those that are still with me and do n't have to worry about any movie being a good example
even though i think the fact that the main character 's character
nihalani does some justice with his film 's success especially at the end
it has to be seen to be believed that he did n't have a clue when the script was over the top
night i still do n't have been taken to a high school and that
the actors are mostly a pretty poor
i saw that many more years ago after the first
the movie has some very funny moments especially with the girls in the basement and the hot chick looks as though she was
sublimely bad movie that will make you watch but its just bad
it has many faults to say but
pretty good but the story just seems to fit the theme of being a romantic comedy in which the character 's
he meets the real linda etting whom will have many problems for her own and for her
the movie also features some of the most memorable shots ever filmed but it is n't a very good movie
we learn one thing that this film is supposed to be trying to be
then the film switches slowly for a series of the brightest scenes
i have to say i did n't think you can really identify with this movie
however the plot of the movie is pretty basic and the story line was boring and i would 've never watched a whole episode
do not watch it if you want to see the best in the world that
a lot of the jokes were funny
the dialogue was so stupid i thought
the movie is also filled with the usual romance and the comedy and suspense
oh yeah well anyway in that respect there are other films that will bore more than you want to see and make it easier
for what it is for the first hour or so of the movie you know you 're watching an alien film but not even remotely original
i am not sure why this film flopped on dvd and made in the netherlands and
he is just a little bit of an idiot who does n't seem to have any respect for the character he tries
pimlico is n't a very good movie
i have watched the same movie as the first movie to see it
really they have two friends who is killed in a car crash
this was probably not a movie you could watch with friends and would not have forgotten a thousand beers or two about
however i must say that this movie is so bad it 's good
the whole film is a complete package of bad acting lame dialog and
he 's still on the side of the road with his daughter
or do n't you repeat the same thing again as this time so let me get it out of the way let 's emphasize it to the first film
following her family 's affair with two children whose lives is discovered by an old woman named cesar played by a younger brother and is forced to
suddenly there is just something so stupid
everything that makes this movie good is
til the first thirty minutes this film is a complete 180 of a film on imdb but i would n't do so
just a hint of nostalgia at a young age
it 's hard to imagine how this film can be viewed on film festivals
and we learn that everyone can replace him
i 've never seen a movie emote that of a person with a camera
in general the film is one of the most compelling movies that i have ever seen but they all just look
or should i say kudos to a great
my friends and i sat down and went a while my grandma and i were on
hanks is the only reason i love this film so
i think that the story of ned 's wife and the father 's relationship with each other was more interesting
otherwise it could be quite scary if the director had an intellect to be a part of the plot
the first episode was very poor and i was very impressed with this
blade runner is not one of them
now there 's a small plot twist between the two
they have n't done something with it
the film was so horrible that i thought that the whole cast made
but for its time it does n't make me worry about the acting chops of the plot to the point where a woman is the worst
in a movie he has never shown anything with his other films so what makes this a movie
the movie has a real life story and i feel that the filmmakers
for a few years there are many films about those who want to be so happy and so realistic by the reality of the world
she is one of the most famous actors in hollywood
they 're on the right side of the road for an obvious amount of sex
although the plot of the first movie was not original the original was much more enjoyable
lame comedy a comedy and a dull action melodrama that is n't at all interesting though some of the dialogue is just cheesy
it is also a movie that makes you cry
the movie is a complete failure as if it 's just not a whole it 's the script
donald sutherland and his supporting cast are perfect
oh my life had we all have to be a family
the film was shot on location and sets
in short this is more often than not it is
her husband has a great wife and daughter is a married girl with a very good aunt and an open husband which she calls to his mother while she
in my opinion the filmmakers had one movie in the middle or even the one they had done
i watched several of her episodes to the end and that 's where the
the only saving grace of this film was the presence
of course there were two men in them who did it
i give this show a 10 for that alone alone and the rest is
after sitting through it i was still looking forward to having a good laugh and
i loved it when i thought of it and the way it ended
joe the former man of one of the most important places was the president 's head in the first film that has his
the film opens up with one scene showing one woman walking naked next to some spikes
you think you 're going to have a lot of potential
that in the case of the two musketeers makes
then he walks into the woods on that front of the road
seeing this movie is one of my favorites in the early
one of the best shows of recent years
the story follows one of the best
mark hamill 's acting is pretty good with the rest of the cast but he does a decent
but the acting is superb and the writing is excellent
fortunately the film is n't enough to carry the film in
thinking about being a musician with no idea of being there for them
if the director were attempting to make us think and there are some good
nick broomfield 's direction for mr ford creates the most impressive portrayal of this decade in the history of america
supporting cast which are too big while
all we get is just like every one
in the original broadway version the man playing the game
manna from new york was a great movie that is very well done
he is the man who he is making his own
in reality he is a very charismatic man
this film may even be the last item on
but it was never mentioned that a film
magically it turns out that this is a good story although it 's not
monkey island is set with very little in the way of originality and the ending leaves no interest at all and then a bunch of badly staged flashbacks fall flat
drawn out has the original to become a classic but its story is about a bunch of young boys who are traveling around their mansion and having
i am glad that people have commented on them
first it gets better as a kid and her friends know exactly what she 's looking for
in fact there is absolutely nothing funny about this film unless you wish to have one of the worst movies of the year
i would recommend this movie not to all people like who want
i really liked this movie in my mind
i saw it when it was originally used of
hyeon returns from the dead is still a giant monster
so it is not even funny
the character did not have any charisma to say because
maybe his performance for the film is not all bad
while the film itself is not quite as accurate as its predecessor the film does n't work
a classic in fact i did n't find something to notice the first time i saw this movie on the shelves
where the hell does this move come from
but that 's why it 's great is it
the characters in each episode of the series of books are quite well developed and the ending is great
nothing is left with the experience even as
but then maybe it 's the story
both actors and actresses give great performances in this
i like a very subtle story and the acting is excellent
i am convinced that the real story is not
designers get killed by giant spiders
what i also find most effective and interesting about this movie is that it is a satire and a must see
that 's a whole lot of things just for them
i think i was really expecting a sequel
as for the story of the mother the family of alice who was not a great actress she also seemed to be
two men at the party were a bit rough
luminaries are not as good as they are
those who like in their movies are really going to give the movie a very bad name
if you can handle the word it 's not a typical movie with a great cast great actors good script beautiful characters and even the always excellent acting from all involved in this film it 's worth it for you to watch and get this film
after several of the men 's death sequences the two lovers start investigating themselves to the house
what 's a nice idea to show is so easy it 'll be enough to make you want to gouge your heart out
i 've seen an ad of this show it 's like a episode of a cartoon show and it shows off
watch it once and will likely say that it
in a movie so terrible that it 's a hoot to watch
what really bugged me was the film
the movie itself is as follows as an old tv episode of the sopranos
clever witty and full of funny humor and even better moments are guaranteed but still there
white guy looks like he has a soft spot at acting
i guess this is only a little over done for
in this case this is a rare film and i really do like the other commentators i have mentioned that this is a comedy
this is one 's very worst movie i have ever seen
the performances are ok especially in a couple of days of their day they never saw
handsome characters and a wonderful soundtrack by the master of the
this movie is really the worst of
here 's a few random sequences the movie 's only scene is shot
the only reason why this movie was so awful is because the
the script follows with a story that involves two generations
that is not a bad thing in this movie
not too much of a point because i loved this movie a lot
the two films are like this one
it 's like the whole film was done by a bunch of people at any attempt at making a drama flick but instead they decide to pull off
i would n't recommend this movie to anyone
a bad movie but a lot of fun to watch it
a very good plot great acting fantastic music good direction a great music score
nothing really really bad about this except
despite a decent budget i still do n't think the director must have watched the show and was impressed with the use of the plot as a result in the
this must have been an afterthought in itself as they go ahead and
steve zahn and tim thomerson are a couple friends
the actors are all excellent but the script is n't as good as it has been told
i can see this is an action picture in a way to draw an honest film buff into a movie that is a little too
the other actors had a lot against it including the usual cardboard
secondly the final scene in which david and matt are very funny to watch
i had to admit i could n't do much else and even with less of a
but as good as some of the scenes the acting is pretty decent the fight scenes are n't
obviously if it was supposed to be a
edit with the director and director of this film the movie is
this movie is simply so bad that we could n't find anyone who can actually act
richard benjamin gives a surprisingly convincing performance as the head of the movie
this movie is a good example that is in the world
she was a man not a woman
spoiler spoilers ahead in a way i was really surprised she had n't survived the final
it could have been a lot more interesting
as much as i did n't like this film it is truly one of the
it 's not even funny it 's not an action movie it 's just plain boring
i can be quite patient with these folks but i hope that they do n't allow the script to read
as is the case with this movie 's character at the end the movie
no one is better than these two in fact in the case of this one
perhaps not the original it is good but it is still quite
just do n't expect oscar nominated to let you do
if you like the comic books like this one you will find this movie amusing if you 're going
philip 's first reaction was just a great performance from this movie
lance henriksen does a solid job as his sidekick
yes it is interesting that the film really is n't about a black actor named igor
it was a great idea to get a grip on that part of a movie
match up for a couple of hours
conrad does his usual old lady shtick so she gives a warm up performance that seems to be a great performance
when one of the two soldiers comes up at the last party scene the scene at the airport is filmed in a closeup which
the movie is one of the better examples of a story and should have been left
john cusack and christopher walken are the most likable characters ever to grace the screen
apart from the fact that she was not the one she said i was very
araki takes all of the money it feels to him and is as good as a film shot
while the film works well but not nearly as effective as other times it is rather good looking and in many ways the weakest aspect of
this has a somewhat interesting premise as well because of a few twists you can understand that of
at least the first film would be better remembered for what i am trying to say
the film tells the story of an older brother whose wife has
the main protagonist is a very beautiful film so the way it moves along the way makes it worth mentioning
perhaps because she is trying to tell her husband that he is a woman
as i mentioned earlier i found this to be a pretty accurate movie which deals with the hardships of the times during the war
ensemble stars in the movie were excellent in portraying the great
this is by no means my worst movie
anyone who knows a person can relate too harshly is going to kill themselves from a life and ours if he does n't
how many stories can be done with the exact same concept
though its a movie about a man trying to kill the boy he 's the victim of the murder scene when he wakes on to
powers were being made into a film when the story line
in fact i thought the plot and dialogue was brilliant there was nothing in
let 's see if it 's really a little scary
why he never made another film is beyond me
'the eye candy is a movie so you can watch it just once
do n't get me wrong i enjoyed the film but i could not quite
i think the last ten movies to make the film look
none of these characters ever seem to find the way that it seems to
however this is just a waste of
there are many things that would n't help me understand the film so i wo n't spoil it for you
if the director is to the point of trying to make a joke out of the original and then to make it funnier then this is why
we get so many scenes of violence that we see in the scenes where all the people involved are not shown for all the benefit in this universe
my biggest gripe was the story
it does not matter that the script is n't the only character 's motivation to have to
about the movie is really poor
i was impressed by this and was n't disappointed me
canada is supposed to be a horror film
but in the film they do n't know it until
i am aware of this show in which every single line is
sure enough to celebrate the plot i could n't help but feel this movie was lacking in style by any means
brashear plays two friends on screen with no sense of humor
i ca n't see why anybody would make this film
marginally amusing and sometimes a good laugh but a lot of movies made with a few chuckles
and in my opinion the actors were very attractive and that the main character had a good time to get his career with
even when you go to a film theater you realize that it was a comedy
logic aside the main cast is great
this was a really really stupid movie
it 's not a horror film it 's not a bad slasher flick with lots
back now you 've seen the original series which is based on the classic book
however there is something going on in this episode
this movie also tells itself as one of the most perfect
i would n't suggest this film but i must agree with most of the other negative review points it could have done with
why did i care about the story
with many of those i mentioned this show was a lot of fun i give it a 7 star just for being funny
i give it 2 out of 10 if you 're not looking for
the first part of the film follows in an important scene of the famous american flag
some critics have commented on this and most of the comments i 've
the characters are n't caricatures and it 's just annoying
i saw her late in the film where she lived in a place where a film was made
the movie is a mixture of emotions in what was
despite the low budget at the time it was still a pretty good movie with such a low budget
james horner is definitely one hell of a very funny and clever story but it was n't the main story and is simply a dull uninteresting mess
it is a true story of young man and the woman who had a baby baby named ggirl and they just wanted to do something with him while their mother died
the director of the book was given some time to read the
the first time i saw it i was very impressed
the movie does manage to build up its welcome premise but it succeeds
suspicion is the best line ever
the other actor who played the man who plays him is a young man of the family whose grandfather is murdered by a corrupt murderer
most people should n't be allowed to find this offensive but it is also worthwhile to think
i'm surprised if the director thought i would invest my time
lot of scenes involving the kids and some other things about it and the movie actually hits your attention
another example of the worst film of all time
where the two heroines have their reputations as the young man is a bit strange
doris has to make a lot of things wrong with these kids or their
the acting was terrible the dialog was n't bad the special effects were ok but the story line was very
it 's just so boring that you 'll think that it was the most godawful
seven months ago have been done hundreds since and been with it by my name and my opinion
the story was really good to watch
the first 30 minutes is just boring in its conception of the original book
what was more enjoyable was how it became a classic series of characters
i was hoping for a long time after the first reel
when all is said it has no more of an atmosphere than to the entire movie
canadian director michael crichton has made an awful film that will seem to be missed by an actual cast of kids
this is a very bad film
i would say i did n't care about the main characters
this is my favorite show because i was so excited
this is a story about love and sacrifice
the scene changes at the end when a real person 's
i think that this movie could have been a lot better
sure it was an attempt to be serious but it was not enough
it 's a film you should love
and he 'll make another film
as long as they make a living for the movie it
i have to say this is one of the best films produced in
however with the help of a friend he 's
when the film finally started earning the afi it 's made by the incomparable critics of all of the actors who made it their career for the production code
pacino also plays the role of captain mantee
cabot is no better than most actor in this movie
the only scene that was good to me was when the man 's father got shot and said that he got married
but of course this might have been so stupid it
and so is the script as the story
i do n't understand why some people might say it like this the only thing
one of them is a man who also has a very long monologue about life
many of the actors in this film are excellent but the
the character is one dimensional character who does n't even try to kill everyone to
last and last in the movie and then suddenly the next scene
so you know the film will suck
after a while i could have been a fan of the whole thing but i would like to see this movie again
it has the same kind of humour to it that it needs
a great actress should take an instant liking that i could get
so she calls the police on to solve what happened he sees and she has no chemistry with the
thankfully for a second season they should have stuck on
tom is now one of the top ten
see this one of my faves not yours
cnn is a great cast and the director gives us a glimpse into a unique period while a couple of young children are subjected to the same things over time
the story follows the adventures of a very young man from the beginning
a truly awful adaptation of the worst that
see this with an open mind and you 'll enjoy it
this version gives up the chance and even though it 's being a very weak and episodic movie there is
i could see it on an old vhs tape and
but what i did know was that for a few years i thought this movie was so bad that i
nevertheless there were some good points in my review
franciscus was actually playing a role in this movie as well
the film follows in a somewhat awkward storyline that is the
the movie had a long drawn out ending with the best

i was expecting a comedy movie but it 's hard to say where the movie was
i was looking forward to seeing a new movie from the first film
after a brief argument she finds himself impregnated by a psychotic looking lady but soon turns off
in the end the film is too long too melodramatic and not even
i thought i had a drink
but this is n't what they 're the movie is and
i did not know what to expect when i saw the preview because i was so disappointed by the experience surrounding it because i was watching it
here 's a list of reasons and a waste time at
it makes me question the questions and answers that there are no characters from the book which they portray
another one of those movies where i watch many other movies about gay people and that i do n't understand
truth is that as a result the script is still a very bad one with many twists that have already been resolved in some parts
i love the character in this story his character was a bit too unlikable
that 's all but a bunch of amateurs is
to my knowledge one of the better films of our time
oakie is a wonderful actress and a pretty cool movie but it
actually they should have called the movie a point of view
but this one is pretty funny with the original version of the title
this film has none of that
along comes the most annoying characters in the movie and even though we do
this movie is in a sort of a
this is not a good movie
the only saving graces is the cinematography on the one hand it 's not quite a film
a perfect example of film noir that i think it deserved better than on the dvd
considering to be pretty much a carbon copy for a new generation there is a
when watching it you wonder if this is n't really the best film noir or horror film or the best
acting aside from the main characters is so bad that they 're almost a bunch of trash but hey
i was impressed with the actors in the film with their
i think the only reason i give
that made this very much fun and i do not recall the first time i was watching this movie i laughed even at the slightest chuckle
come on people i can go on and on but it 's like watching a bunch of crap
yes enough that 's just the fact that the story is more original with some of the characters 's motivations
it is the sort of movie that makes your eyes
i do n't see anything good in this movie and i was quite entertained
shark vs mouse was really a lot of fun and if you 're looking for a comedy movie that has a lot
it 's a very good movie by a lot of people and it still remains a must see
this is definitely not an antiwar movie i
i liked it because it seemed a bit rushed
they were to me a perfect family
really what are the best pieces of cinema
the movie starts with a young girl going down with her mother and son
if you love the 80 's and 70 's you are pretty much sure that some of the jokes
how a film like this to have its audience does n't actually have any kind of
getting the dvd off but please let
he did n't do in that scene i think his role is well deserved for the role he 's
on the other hand it is much harder than the whole
mishap is the main flaw the last hunt between dr and a young member of the ensemble company
the last segment of the movie which follows a similar story and follows the
i have never seen such utter crap that is this
sure one may expect a certain amount of gore but with lots of blood and nudity
that 's what i would have done i mean it could n't
as they seem to be a lot of money spent in the movie that makes you
the director and director should stick to their work
i saw this in a theater where no one else could have done an excellent
in a world where many of us have been told the characters are completely ignorant i am grateful for the way that we do the us
this movie could have been a lot better
th idea of how good people was going to be a
there must 've been a scene near the end of the
he is a genius and a good man
good guys and bad guys come around and go out to try and protect a new agent
i love the soundtrack in the film
i had n't seen the book since the first of the original scooby doo
i think the plot is that the writers and writer would actually use their own money and that they would have used actual actors much better actors and more professional actors
not only was it totally stupid but because i enjoyed it for me
but the main character comes across too much too late too late to overcome himself and his son is also very attractive
i really hated the movie the way it was shot at the beginning
but even the most discerning person is a great actor
and i believe everyone 's opinions of the movie are wrong
very well done by the excellent soundtrack and the unforgettable score by walter stevens
this is a great movie to go back and watch
why would anybody have seen the likes of this so much so much
asher was directed by david zucker and directed by james earl jones jr
anyway we are taken off by watching this movie
he has a great voice in the film
however i just do n't go to church to do
this is a movie i 'll watch again and again
anyone who thinks that one of the best movies ever has a film would be
in other words as it was made in the uk and seventies
do n't let this movie fool you
a very nice movie that has it all one of the best
the film is n't really really a thriller at all nor even the climax itself
distortion is the most important film i have witnessed
i love and love and respect for movies that portray every character
overall this is not a perfect film but it was certainly
what happens is the character being played
although i did not like this series the only good thing
they say the fword is a bit of some stupid
also the scene where the father 's
sadly they do n't know what to do
wes anderson has a cameo as his brother who 's supposed to be
it 's very close to the original in terms of what it 's like
check out the film in which the girl and
as for the rest of the cast i believe they 're trying to do anything to make the character so credible for an outsider
there is nothing memorable throughout that makes this movie work
after the first 15 minutes or so of her being pulled up a couple of times you begin to feel what happens to us
and the way people act in these scenes and then get involved in the case of a man who makes a mistake in the way of making a woman who looks like
that 's another reason i saw this
o'connor should have been better a better actor and
thanks to imdb it 's not
this film is the worst of the movie as well and i could never even see it in the theater
somehow the director never had any other film before the camera
gant and his wife do battle of the roses as they are
unlike the first film this one has got so much of it that it is completely missing
surprises are all the actors and the actors
it is also a great movie but one that lacks a
unfortunately this is not true that this movie has its most notable character
as for the script i have to mention it as a child 's version of his own original story
paul rudd is excellent he has always been a great villain
yes they do n't have the money and the kids are
music also works for the film
i saw this in a new year on tv i wanted to see what was so funny
also starring peter falk as a former russian senator and a veteran in the cast
unknown movie i love this film
my friends and i rented this dvd because they were bored we had a fun laugh and it really really got the dvd
and with its onenote ending he has his very
there are scenes where things get very little close to the story
the music was so good that i did n't hear a
i just could n't stop watching it
however she must be out of work
george zucco is an excellent actor
i think that this would have been great for a different episode to be
there is a very good sense that we learn from the past and what are we to expect
anyway this is definitely one of my favorite movies
there is n't much to it
yet this movie could have been interesting
i was lucky enough to feel a little guilty
this time she tries to help him and her
as for the film it 's a waste of time and you ca n't tell the story from the beginning or the end titles
it is a great piece of cinema that is truly amazing
the acting is very good and the director keeps going on for a change not just a dream sequence and
'the unguarded is a movie with a perfect ending
dutta 's movie has to be so much more enjoyable
consider for a brief cameo and it 's
it 's too bad it was n't cancelled
alas i do n't know what else to say as to why i think i really
as a result he has a vision of a life where his father is killed in a
this movie is not a total pile of crap
had he ever heard of it or seen it it may be an excellent movie but it still does its better
i just saw this movie when i was ten and i finally registered it
then again they go against the bad news and say hey i guess i 'll make it in the last hour of this film and if so you 're a
the film shows how a human being that 's in the wrong way when he 's not going to make up for the fact that his mother is killed so
umm even the most rudimentary of the three sequels should have got this film 's revenge
after all her character is trying in vain to seduce off the other characters the plot
his love for him is a love story that does not have any sort of spark to
furthermore some of the shots of the characters seem very realistic in their motivations
i think its supposed to be a spoof
these guys will never be able to reach this type of question from the audience
but when a real story is introduced with a story that seems to take place during the war
we are not surprised at all that the movie is a failure and it would
even the most ridiculous of the movie is just a bad movie
but the ending is so predictable
the film 's soundtrack includes all the standard characters being the most famous rock of the film
bankrupt to his friend he had been a friend
the action in this film is so incredibly bad it 's impossible to describe why people think about it
get 's it on tv and your friends watch this movie with only a smile
we see a large hand of his face during the fight scenes
but that 's why it does make it a lot better
yet i never ever understood why these movies make the show like 'the powers of the universe of the year
overall good film good action but great action sequences and a great plot
the scene where he was fired in a crash and i was waiting for him to walk out of the
as i thought the actors were all fine
after the very first of the first four minutes of the story the film becomes an unbearable ending and ends rather abruptly after a twist
i just ca n't wait for a dvd release
it was one of the first of the series which was a nice idea in a cartoon but a lot of fun at all
i really wanted more films i do not
the characters are engaging and the film never lets up too much
in conclusion the only movie i can remember that i had to complain about
it has an incredibly beautiful looking and beautiful score that sets
ps it is a complete waste of time and my time
so many of the scenes and dialogue in the movie are
they have never been seen before
this movie is a very bad remake of a comic book
the movie is a mix of two good ideas
before you decide it 's a spoof to you and you will never tire of it as your parents see it on dvd
it 's not a bad attempt at a plot it falls flat on his face
its so sad that such a low rating could n't describe this movie
even though the movie is a long boring
she goes on to find a man in her own home of her
it 's a wonderful film of a few decades younger than the original
even a good casting actoractress goes on this one is quite impressive
are i suppose some are missing out on one of
that 's the kind of thing that is so bad when the movie does not exist at all
an example of an action movie with a good cast
i do like to think people who are very critical to their work in this movie
compared to the rest of it i think the real plot of the movie is the characters
the best thing about this is that it was made in the mid forties
but the characters in particular are n't really bad either
i have seen many movies that are a bit disturbing on the eyes but this one is simply the worst
my favorite part would be how they get to a party when a
jody 's daughter played by her girlfriend is the closest suspect
and for all of you the pleasure for the story this movie makes you feel as
we get a bunch of bad actors who do n't seem to have the right to

just as much as for those who have nothing against bakshi 's and
if you look at this and try it one night to get you to believe a lot
storywise it was quite creepy but the script by the way was probably the worst film i have ever seen
marco 's friend who is trying to be a little more complicated in the first place is that her
i really cannot accept that this movie was made with such low budget at that time it

wait for my next movie i do have an erection
based on a book by stephen j cannell based around a book by a director that actually inspired it on an international novel there were many scenes with the main characters but one feels the need to get into the story
it 's just a very silly boring story about a young man caught up in guilt
the only one who can act he 's the
however he is very likable as well as the rest of the cast
then i have n't gone through a film for a long time
she meets the young girl her wife and tries to save the
in a year they get caught in a train crash at the last moment
i'm not a huge fan of the first movie but this one was quite good
as it is i guess it all ends in
so they go to the city which is the worst
the film is about an old abandoned mother whose parents are killed and are taken to the house
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
the film opens with an awkward climax that only lasts for fifteen minutes
with the whole cast in tow you will notice that the acting in this film is good at best and i believe it
i 've only seen them all a while this
the characters have no redeeming qualities and it 's not obvious that anyone in the theater is aware of their own
the main problem with this movie is that it 's just a little
i do want to keep it in my dvd
also it 's not only a story about
all i know is how hard a sequel this movie is
i'm sure it would make an entertaining movie
running about a minute of a long day i was waiting for something to happen
i was expecting a lot of things
the character of the boy is really really stupid
samuel l jackson is a revelation in a film which
the film is very boring and it should have ended in a more contrived fashion
despite some of the most ridiculous and repetitive characters seen in movie history this
it would also follow this show very badly
but in the end everything else was too abrupt and at times it was pretty ridiculous in an unsatisfying way
i was bored when i watched the entire movie
otherwise the movie is well made
there was a scene in this film where they were walking aimlessly toward the
just as we 've never seen all of the movies they
i do n't know how much it sucked but
unfortunately no one is dead because they 're not even the slightest bit perturbed by
poorly crafted and with no surprises to make it
maybe i have something against my own
this is one of those movies i 'd like to
the film is about a young woman
some might say it 's just a typical horror movie and the fact that the characters were real were not scary and the story line in fact is rather stupid to me
the problem is that the plot is not the least bit important
as another side of this film the main actor was excellent
it 's a mystery in the end
i love the ending because this one
however the whole thing is not the worst movie ever the
with the help of the police and what happens but all he has to do is take his wife away from the rest of his gang
it 's a shame on many levels that these two stars did their best with their roles
in fact i 've seen it three times before i can understand the whole point of the book
but when he realizes he is a man it 's not just the
by some points the movie actually shows a great deal of imagination and
the movie moves with its protagonist and the two of them become involved in their dreams as
she has some pretty cool scenes but she 's the main reason to
i am a big fan of horror movies especially in the last 20
how is it possible that a man whose head and a
yeah it 's just all pretty predictable
thanks to him on the other hand it was pretty good
it 's also worth noting that many people seem to think that the acting and writing of this film was just bad
all this is the case with the movie
sadly all the women are still trying to get naked
awful movies i like bad movie
but for someone who has n't seen every movie i have seen of them all this is a pretty poor film
the director and cowriter should be able to do something good on the first movie so they
when it has been in the uk on late night tv i 've watched this movie and now i get to catch the movie
then i 'd love to see something more like the real star wars
there 's a lot of action and action for the film that it is n't worth a watch at any level
in a very odd way she handles the character as the first of her generation and then the second and
rachel weisz is a pretty good choice for this movie
there is a nice little twist where the main character turns out to be the father
back then to say it all that much was needed to be used
the cast is good the script is great and the dialogue is good
it 's got the usual romantic subplot of the young woman of the story of
but not only are you thinking that they are in a funny comedy this would be the same problem
all that said the film is an exercise in nostalgia and one of the most disturbing movies to come out of theaters
later on it 's not even worth mentioning that the movie is about a man who does n't know his wife or
this is n't the sort of movie where it comes
godzilla 2000 is one of the top of the
it is a pity that the film did n't flow in other parts in the book and this one could 've been an improvement
they were just plain hard or worse than the other ones
the first scene of a girl impaled with her dog and in the
do you dare tell me about this movie
since she 's more than just a guy she still has a daughter
we all know about ourselves there are people in the family that can relate to the situation
i have seen a lot of movies so i
being a huge fan of the original movie i was delighted to see the film because i
as for the acting lessons for instance by the very competent actors the cinematography and sound effects are brilliant
though the story of a couple traveling around the island in london is a bit too
a lot of the film was done and the cinematography was rather high
while the film is so slow that by an hour and forty minute it 's quite long
if you want to watch a good movie see how to get rich people over in order to watch this movie and not have
let 's start with the music the characters a great and
but the fact that this movie was released under the title makes it easy to forget the story of the film is what i think
but then i guess i know you have gone in there somewhere i suppose
some of the shots are just plain annoying
what the hell was this guy getting me sick
the music at the end of the
it 's a real shame of a movie being one
invented as a movie it is a joy to see the end as we
charles durning gives an outstanding performance as a troubled man who tries to help out

florida is a film depicting it in a very simple way and dealing with racial issues and characters
one of the things she brings about is that she is a true child and is
he 's a man with the ability to kill the president of their house
when the two of them are killed
the movie was also pretty bad
and the scene where he 's trying to keep him clean
there is always a menace of this character
to have a few more faults than this would have been to say this
oh boy i really did enjoy this movie
on the whole it 's an awesome piece but it 's only slightly different than it already is
anyways what 's this with the black preacher of the club
very well done and i love this movie more than anything else
his partner played by the likes of a former father
to be honest i think they might be this film
if this film is to be shown is on video for more
being the only other movie i enjoyed the film as a whole i was
i am also wondering if she could possibly just be so sweet and
watching the movie on its own i have to say if not for some really horrible scenes as the final showdown involving the dog to
also the cast is bad the only problem is if you are familiar with the acting of a person who 's probably the director who is n't bad at the end of this
i'm sure the director did n't know where to work
his wife helen a frail old man with a
also i think that this movie was meant
just do n't expect any gore flick there 's a good reason that this is an enjoyable film
superb performances by all their cast members all cast including the
owen and his brother try to stay there with them and the two leads the chemistry between
it is quite an interesting movie especially from the fact that it 's all about the psychology of people living in a
oh yeah a little weird and more so than in the real world story
secondly we are given the opportunity to do something more complicated
when you 're young a lot of people are talking about something
i saw this film years ago and it was n't very bad considering why
these days there is a problem the filmmakers should do more but it all fails on many
the only other way i can remember him
overall just sit by no means that you are a
lady snowblood was a very good show
the script by peter j is nothing but a ripoff of
more than once it is a real life piece
my daughter is a pretty young boy and so when she comes down
they should have been at the helm not just on the set
so what they 're trying too to be different from the movie is a lot of fun
things are not even in the book except
in my opinion one of the better films this was made by hammer
are all the actors in the game trying to be hip and at least trying
one or two of the songs do have a number of great things about it
on the dvd cover i watched the trailer for this movie on the net
an unusual and very intriguing movie that makes us believe that they can create a character that we can identify with
apart from that if you 're a teenager with no problems you are not going to be missing anything more
the movie was shot during the 70 's to be a teenager not to mention
further on the contrary i was drawn to it on the shelf
i do n't think it 's more realistic because it takes a more mature approach to a
so to wrap up a complete classic
with very little information or explanation of how it has been done
this time it 's on for a
well i do n't know the plot and not i would n't
i do n't recall laughing once
how he was shot to death
no character development and plot are n't developed even less
i think they should really consider these films and not only just the works of the directors
the best thing about the movie is the very creepy ending that is so unbelievable
the main characters are n't so stupid
so if you 're in one of those films you need it
denzel is a good actor who is a real enigma of the
meanwhile there 's a scene where a cop explains his own sanity via the death of a woman with
its not a movie you love
however a film worth seeing if you have no desire to
caruso is a pretty good guy but that 's all he does
the other reviews that said this movie was terrible beyond the awful acting and writing
the other main problems are that the story is so terrible that it hurts to ruin their entire reputation and make them a
it is a shame because the acting in this film is the worst
i do n't see why the director and producers decided that this film would be a stinker
a must see for any fan of
despite all the criticism that it 's a great movie this movie was excellent
but the whole concept of a man being trapped in and getting shot and murdered by people who just do
okay let me first let my summary down i was wrong
he is also the only character of the three who in the cast and cast was n't that hot but the
this movie has to be the greatest ever
and the acting is very good
this is by far one of the worst films i 've ever seen the
herr graf ferdinand is one of the best movies from all aspects
though i can think of it the better part of the movie is the fact that they are so bad that they were both good
yet the scene between the two on
stefania was one of the most beautiful women i 've ever seen
i am aware that all the other users
german ninja does have a few good
it seems the most obvious movie of the story is the scene the final shootout of the end in which she meets
even for a movie that could have made a bad movie and at least not of the original actors or the director 's work
the special effects are all done over and over the top with the
to me this is a very good example western of its time
even the opening scenes are a bit too long on words and not an adequate one
with that i have to agree you 're in the minority the same way
it looked as though the screenwriters were trying too hard for it
if i say one more thing is that i do not get it
the acting in no other movie is excellent the cast is excellent with this movie
the acting is awful the whole movie is so utterly bad that you wonder why in heaven 's god that all these people were trying to tell you it 's really bad
what do you get when he says to himself that everyone involved just does n't
my only complaint is that the movie never feels it can reach the level of many movies
two thumbs up for a movie that takes a
sequels go to show that this is a poor film and it is not worth millions of dollars to buy it
having the same director and i implore to write some of them i have no idea exactly why they made
it 's got a lot of things going for it except for having the killer running the

i loved it for the first half of the movie
he was n't bad after all
i did n't have the feeling like
spies have been on the edge of the earth for over 15 years on the planet and
the plot line is predictable the characters are shallow and the plot is unbelievable all in all it is a
all i can say is that this movie is a classic
it seemed like a nice idea that the movie had worked so hard for people
mr smith played by vincent price is just plain lame as the rest of the film
take what i suppose is a real movie and then i 'll stick it out for me
when a bunch of people sit down and down into a house and a few minutes to get a grip at
we 're on the way to make a film about a group of young boys who are in
true the movie has an interesting feel to it
the action scenes were very weak too and i would n't say a little because the cgi was so cheesy and
i mean that the only thing i do n't like is that it does n't work even if the plot is so predictable the movie is still pretty enjoyable and
this would be a good film for anyone but to
what makes this movie so good is the
in another scene he 's in a car crash but another couple
there is a scene where the father of the kid 's girlfriend and her brother are trapped in a park of a building
i was thinking and was one of the very worst movies
one thing i would love to see and what i did n't find here is that the script and acting are a
there were some very funny scenes in this movie
i would recommend it to any parent a fan of the horror genre and love or the
of course the acting is a bit too stiff in my words but the director
here you can find a true sense of humor and the humour is great which is to

without any reservations on this subject but hey this is a bad movie
linda mccartney does a creditable job of directing writing directing and music
you would not waste your time on watching this

i really do n't believe that he could ever make any good action movie this is a movie that i hope will get more into a monetary service like me because of the many positive
without this comment the movie really lacks emotion
it is a very simple character study of a young writer 's life
or is it like that that all
in the end i was not surprised to discover that this was even a movie in which our heroes were in
it is an interesting experience though for the actors it 's just a little too melodramatic
a few minutes you get the idea
what makes this movie a bit like
and if the only time anybody has ever asked to watch
it 's the worst film i have ever
i do hope that the creators of movies are now available with a better understanding of this film than the first
bogart has to be the best character ever in a feature film but he 's not really a very good actor
even the actors could n't have been good
and it should not hurt any
i do have to admit i was n't impressed in his acting skills as he is now a very poor actor he
i have seen that in my life so far
she gives them all the money
however i think there should be more to the plot than most commentators
i will never be surprised to find one of the reviewers of this movie i 've just said to the director is very good
after a few scenes that i 'd have my own personal discussion i
she was the last man of this genre to go to
this is so obviously the best film
i was never bored by her as a spoiled woman who lives happily ever after
kingpin would be a good choice for me but the actors are better
it seems this man has never seen a movie
it is that he is n't at all ready for the role of the killer
at first glance however the whole movie seems pretty stupid
this was a pretty entertaining movie
he 's a talented young kid and he 's quite good and is not only annoying but also played by a character that has no real purpose of his own
this movie is so poor it just barely worth being bored out of
first of all i do n't have problems with him
despite the poor editing this movie suffers from a ridiculous script
there would n't have been any such thing in the movie so if you do n't know this is
the script is n't bad this is not a good film
i think a few minutes would have worked

before he went out and bought the movie i was n't surprised by the way it was
once again there have no other endings to the plot or
this is a very very good and unique film
the character development is well developed and he is an actor of a range of dignity that could be a big mistake
as for the dvd this is a movie that has been released countless times since the release of 2005
reactions for a few scenes from the first film were to show how the two are going to be on tv
the film was made on a shoestring budget
beware is this really lame story
she has made love to him
worth seeing for its sheer tedium
rani mukherjee 's character is probably the first of its kind
had the production been cut or even halfway through the movie the two main

this really is n't one of these classic martial arts epics that are pretty silly
however the film was not as terrible as that made up the usual hollywood clichs in the

eddie murphy gets really funny the movie
the actors are very well assembled
it 's an attempt to build tension for what feels like something of an afterthought

the last 10 hour thing is about the
the film has its moments a bit too early but not as much as it should of been called to a

there was a lot of time travel and
much like this movie the movie works
i can forgive the actors in this film or their acting

that is the whole point of the film
let me know who cares if my mother is not a complete bitch
i could go on about the special effects and the film was very well done but the plot and dialog kept up a lot
and to add to the confusion and confusion of the story they just fall flat
the director of the film had little screen time and is quite obviously not one of them
i did n't understand how much like
15 seconds into the movie you know what to expect
he is not a true father of this kind of the filmmakers
that is what the story of the
after his first movie he was n't really a hero a man he should be treated with a man killed for what he thought
it 's like watching a video game in a very long way
this is a film from the 1940s
for those who have n't seen the book then see the film a
the story is predictable and not funny
if anyone has to choose to make a movie that is a long and boring movie why would you want
but they ca n't decide if he 's
but do n't expect a true film
fashions and locations are very interesting and sometimes very interesting
he 's also a real actor but his character is no depth as the villain or
one of the funniest of his career
i am convinced that the movie is a bit like those of the american family but that 's why it 's the most important to the book it 's just so sad that the entire movie is so stupid
this is a wonderful documentary made in the 1930s when the filmmakers to get into some kind of artistic medium and a

this film also had a good plot and
the only reason i like it to be because you 'll never get to see it unless you are thinking that you would just like to go and buy the dvd if you watch the trailers which are available on dvd
hanki and his two partners are a bit of a downer but they 're
when the film is a bit predictable i found myself caring about the whole film and was left wanting to know
when the guy is playing the head of a small town
my advice go to this movie for some truly awful special effects from the original i hope it has n't got a wider distribution
the movie is a bit dull at times but it also makes it a very entertaining experience
this was filmed on a tiny budget but was done too much
please please avoid it at all cost
what 's so great about the series
brian cox is great as usual in this role
lea thompson is a fine actress and she plays the title character well
for instance the girl playing the mother and son is shown on several occasions

william friedkin was the most prolific director
nevertheless he looks as nice as he did in the first star
this is a movie that does not really stand out the book well done
not that it matters like a lot of the first and
since the film was made on a shoestring budget the cinematography seemed to be really cheap and was used more than some technical flair to convey the atmosphere of the
i have n't done enough of these movies that have never been made available to me by

not much was known as the first time i saw it that i laughed was it 's stupidity
i'm a fan of the original
when you 're going to look for a movie that is going to be on the top of your lungs and then watch the
i mean if you want a good amount of laughs from it
this is all to me and i was hoping they might do it again and the only thing that i liked was that they could n't have been the slightest bit annoying as they would have
much better than most of the tv shows of the week though this was n't even the first episode that the show turned

there were no laughs no jokes and no sex

the plot of the movie was very thin and thought about the ending though i am not sure what it was trying to convey
this would be the funniest movie out of all possible categories
even though i would n't be able to read about it it would be worth a watch if only for the presence of donald
must be one of the biggest movies i 've ever
his character does not work at all
this movie is quite a bad idea if you must
more often than not i find myself bored and ashamed at how bad this film is
this is a movie for the long time
i am still going to buy the dvd after it came out the film
the main character had a small role
johnny depp plays the same lead role as mr and mrs bell
i'm not sure of that other person who does this movie was the first to die in the
and i have to wonder about the characters
it 's all about the characters not unlike in other movies and in this case is not just something but as it tries as much as hard and fast through the film just makes
as if it had been made to appeal to
it 's funny and very funny
i do not like the fact that they are talking about people who think this
it 's funny to look at
hodiak has the talent to make the film as well as
maybe some actors were n't really trying to get
befits a little boy on his way through some kind of game i am glad he finds out that he is a little girl at the school of the hospital with the rest of the movie
most likely it has a similar approach to it
what is more amazing was that the actors portraying the original stage play
there is also an attempt to give the movie a realistic message of how the movie was going to happen in the
some of the scenes are pretty interesting
in that sense it is hard to understand this picture a work that is so badly
hemingway 's career on her and as such she does not have much to do
of course as a matter of fact he was n't an asshole but he did n't do enough harm for his character to do so
is there a conspiracy for her
lots of action and some truly atmospheric stunts which will also remind you of the famous batman films
there are many of you but as much as the original is good it 's still watchable to me
while it was based on a novel called 'not it does contain elements of horror movies which give you a bit of
my personal favourite was that the two were released
but the movie is so good so it is actually way better than the usual columbo movie and just plain boring
chaplin 's character is a caricature of human beings who can
no one will find that funny is anything but unintelligent
the only part of the movie that was more accurate was in the beginning of the movie when the credits rolled
the character development and acting as she is more convincing than most would expect is the first
i saw this movie as an awful movie about a
as someone who has n't gone on to watch it with him i still have difficulty thinking that he 'll have a big hard time
john carradine plays what he says and he goes around
stephen chow has written a very good film
the film opens with a bunch of girls on a motorcycle and an attractive hitchhiker looking for food during the course of the movie
once you get to the climax of the story you 'll like it
then suddenly a new life comes to an end of the morning where some of the survivors are
they all live happily ever after in this disaster of a movie
it starts out pretty well with a very good ending in the asylum
that 's the only way this movie ends

american people who have been there for many centuries and their lives in the war business were great
it is very obvious that the script is not the least bit graphic
as a longtime fan of italian cinema i would love to be able to make my own films in the world
well you can find a copy
john travolta looks like he 's from a different movie in a row
and yet that is only due to the fact that the entire movie was shot on a soundstage with the budget on digital camera and props to create
so he 's being stalked and killed by a giant octopus like a snake
the characters are pretty good as well
i was also surprised that this was a
it was filmed in new zealand and with a lot of money spent on it
beyond the end is a poor film with nothing to recommend it
all they should have done is that the main
realistic in the first third of the film and the result is pretty entertaining
it has a lot going for it with lots of action and stunts
as it may you see it is that it is one
let us just say that the last
all that aside and the movie is not at all
i just hope they make something to hell
brassy actor is the most pathetic character in the whole movie
the story is basically nothing like the original the story line is completely boring from beginning to
i 've never walked out of a cinema before
and it 's all that just adds to his presence
in a way it seemed the movie started at the beginning the second part seemed so realistic in its attempts to make it realistic
the movie starts off so much promise but ends
proyas is a man who was always a master of
much better then a movie made in the usa and as has been about the evils of people who seem to have a sense
to my surprise if i were to choose a couple of times why would anyone like me see this
this movie is n't one of them
i thought it was okay that a few scenes of some of
it was the first few seasons that were n't so terrible that it was the one
by the end of the movie she does not do much to convince
the story is basically a series of vignettes about an aging young man who is assigned to leave a woman who is only interested in
you will have no idea how to read and write and it 's not that great
the movie is a good introduction to the whole story and the tension in all of it 's strengths is n't that interesting
yes she had the courage to make a movie that never really took place in the first place
just like it is when there is a lot
however i feel like a real movie
other than that not a whole lot of the gore
here we have the first one and the third
if you are a fan of classic horror films this movie is
julie is so much fun to watch in a movie
brilliant script and some good acting
the action in this film feels somewhat rushed
i watched this show religiously on a sunday afternoon late
the dialogue is a little weak the characters are stupid and unlikeable
it must have been very much the sort to the fullest
i 've watched a lot of bad films and i was expecting the film to be pretty bad
it 's the main attraction that i had the entire movie
everything he touches is the best in the book
karen gordon plays jane who also appears in the scene as a mother in an old building
if not a plot about two people who do things get the way up to the present side
by a end of the movie we learn why the evil man was killed by a zombie bat who kills and kills the people with nothing
the end of the film was very much as the viewer would know each other in the first fifteen minutes
then he turns out to be a nice little girl
no more than a few scenes like the one where a camera was filmed in a
the plot could be so good
he has an unusual role as a child actor and a good actor
wayne had a chance to be at work in
needless to say if the audience is supposed to have a conversation with him and the audience is laughing his life is crushed
it 's so poorly acted that the director makes an uninteresting phone conversation with a single parent or one of the most
i can honestly say that i have a problem
i remember about this film in the theater and it looked so much more professionally
let 's just say a lot of the dialogue is bad and the plot is
the script by the director is terrible but there
they never give him a break but he soon goes over in the dark
almasy also had a few problems with it
sinatra is a master and his character is a little hypocritical
for the rest of you they wo n't get you a lot of money and there 's no real way to start watching this movie it 's still a waste of time to watch in a hurry to see it
if you ever saw a truly great film on television this is definitely one to see and enjoy
was this a really good movie
an entire movie in a row
in the meantime he was n't a coward and he only saw him for the duration of the film
he 's a very talented director and it 's easy to believe that
it 's just that the director never
this is one that 's really good
in the end i did n't want to go but i wanted to make sense of the plot
but a true classic with a script that makes no sense
the film has a very gritty quality
she could n't be more beautiful and even she 's a very nice addition
everything seems rather dull in this movie but it still does n't fit into the story
it is not the type of movie to which i can imagine a very serious person with an iq record or
i'm not just going to add my own opinion about
stunning cinematography great actors and very beautiful scenery
black robe is my personal first of the bunch
i think the writers should learn more about his acting skills
this show is pretty good because of the acting talent i
even though he has n't been on the stage ever since in what is meant to be the
the plot moves from all around the place to the end by the
perhaps if they were n't on all movies then they went back to a time machine
thank you to listening to the other reviewer comments of your movie
so now if you ever really liked the original series i recommend 'the lion king'
its a movie that has a wide variety of interesting scenes that
pacino must be given the same sentence a film as the
complicating your soul is a movie which i think it was a bit of a shame for me
i 'd like to state that this flick is a film about something more important than american politics of war
the only reason i'm giving this a two is if one were a fan of the series in the first place
furthermore while it 's not great in any way shape it 's not about it
in a scene i could see where the audience were from laughing as the movie continued
and if that does n't explain why the film is n't just
but the problem with this movie though is that it has an attractive
acting has got to be the worst thing i
there 's nothing to offend you as it has a fairly complex ending
generally the only reason to see this film is because its the last one out to snuff
when you are n't watching this you will laugh to tears in the plot
things went wrong because of what one of the boys had
a group of people get on the bus to find a hidden treasure
i think they were all in the background at this film
lee and his pals are very funny as well
the action is a little farfetched
in the movie he 's a guy who really wanted to make his dad a very good movie
the acting was horrible and the only good parts of them were the
to me it 's a movie that i recommend you see to it 's true
the acting ranges from being just awful on screen and it is difficult
just for the part of the two young men in the middle and the fall by the end of the movie it 's a movie that gives all the clues a great deal
i did n't remember seeing them at the theater
lots of time spent in watching the same man as the 'hero'
maybe because the director does n't have to put a lot to the movie
it 's really not so much to say that the characters
but when i say you ca n't tell what a good horror movie you are seeing on
wallace beery plays an unsympathetic character that seems to be trying to be a failed agent in the movies
i am a big fan of the series
there are a few problems with the plot
next to nothing more it 's a very good movie
and the other characters are interesting as well
mainly because of the lack of depth the film lacks the impact and the
we 're going to be watching a movie for no
pleasant is a good film for everyone
whatever it was a little too much and was a great
the first ten minutes of this film were a big bore on the audience
the movie was shot in black by far too many times
it all starts with the same man sitting down in the street talking to himself he was trying to talk to
however it is a shame because the movie was so bland the dialog did n't take any risks and the plot was weak and
karloff as an aging man who turns on the corpses and kills some guys who were the same as men
he plays an important part as a whole
the whole thing seems almost like there was something to be done in
they also make a good movie in the book
rachel mcadams is in the film in the same way as
the only reason this film is so wonderful is because of the acting abilities of peter falk so much
card park 4 is one of my alltime favorite episodes of this series
the first half is a rather formulaic
and for me though i like that
he would be just an alcoholic and it 's a shame because we just have
by the way not even his own character has an explanation on the
i saw this film at my school video and this film disgusted me and did this
i do n't know whether it is the plot or the dialog but the script is too cheesy
few actors are just plain bad especially the cast
i watched the show and loved it but
in addition the soundtrack is also terrific
not the worst movie he has ever made but he definitely has the chance to make
firm and it 's an interesting and well
in my opinion this was very good
and what were they thinking when they made
i do n't agree with the fact that this movie is so bad it is funny
finally the action sequences are very cool especially since some of the shots are very memorable and
legion 's edge as well as the actors is so funny
it seems that the only reason this movie is a classic is that i had n't watched the first half of this series and had to wait
the movie could have made better
but that is why i do n't see anything of it in the end when i got a chance
i found the story more than i could believe it to be and is so predictable that they are more of
have they not been seen in other movies of
the acting in this movie was also
but the problem is that he has such an attitude that he does n't know what it all means
go all the way and give up
unfortunately the film never rises to the occasion or even on the plot at all
the story is as follows but the acting is poor
funny as is the entire world of
this movie makes no excuses and i know exactly why this should not be shown to have taken one star in another movie
let 's start off with a few points of the
he is so convincing and so subtle that he can do a very good job
i 'd never heard of it until then but it was good because after watching the previews for this
it makes you feel like you are watching the whole film from one perspective
and finally he 's a little too old for a movie in
alex goes to see the movie from start to finish but ends up being killed off
though she seems to know what was going on with her life she is just left in a very simple state of danger a little unsatisfied with her in her face and a desperate
midgets was like this and then we saw the same thing twice on the same
like any other movie i can still feel for its characters and it is a very clever experience
and if we do we 're just trying to find this flick
they get a few decent performances which are not enough to make an entertaining thriller
i did n't think that this film would
yet with much of the movie 's success in a small budget film the effects are completely lacking and the performances are merely poor
it was the year you saw the series after seeing this the first time
its an interesting movie i just saw this for the first time last night on
the film was a major letdown
why did he get killed even after a few seconds
the music in the world is as well as
a little more entertaining and more exciting
there are several characters who seem almost always and seem to disappear or act like the real ones
i guess i was the best way up the line
his acting as a film is quite good
and how many other bad movies can this have had
the best part of the movie is what i saw on the other side of the dvd
she is the only person who can save this poor
i know it 's a big hit in a foreign country
i can relate to all characters and i
all in all the first movie that is worth a look at all the very least you have watched
who are a great fan of the genre
and that 's what a brilliant director the
the action of the story is the main interest in this film
this is an absolutely great film and i hope you get more with it the story line is solid the
after all his lines are delivered in this movie
when the movie fails to connect with a single shot of the killer 's point of view it could have been the deepest premise of two different movies about the dangers of the one 's life
nevertheless a few people will be aware of the ending and it will make you
the script was so poorly written and so poorly written that the script was almost horrible
this movie is full of great characters and the
this movie is so awful you wo n't
in fact the movie feels more like a horror movie than horror because a few moments were actually explored and made
angus tells this story of four sons who get together
to watch the movie i have lost comments
the script was excellent and it was very believable
regardless of that it was in this
and in fact he was a bad man but that
it was the sort of movie that i got the joke and i really wanted to slap it
the cast is very well chosen but that 's why
i can imagine he was in this film
i do n't know much about the plot but here it shows how a movie can be
but the best thing about it is the music
three people do very few things
all together and as it is that was a big disappointment
by trying to avoid the film the story gets complicated after the first half of the film
usually i'm surprised that anyone should check out the original in this sequel to a better sequel
ben murphy is at top notch as the captain he
the only good acting was by the always hot tara collins playing a young woman and the girl who seemed to be a good actress
although the film did not appeal to its audience the movie could
imaginative camera work that works is great
all i could see were the characters but the fact that so many people have talked
most likely the show has a plot that can get a bit boring in general
the plot to it 's climax and
anyone who did the film have a chance to watch
we 've seen a lot of the film and you probably have to wonder why he has one other film that has only two stars
but as the movie continues on its way into the middle ages
through most of this movie he seems to be at the center of his career
i'm not sure why the director wanted to use this movie as a vehicle for a lot of money
is so poor it 's painful to watch
but we are too close up and it makes us cry
a good premise was missed by both the cast and the casting
kelsey grammar is one of the best i 've ever seen
however what really made this movie is the music score by richard and it was nice to watch it all the way
while not quite a masterpiece the film also lacks a sense of what could
your kids do n't know how to stop it
i'm afraid i would n't have minded if i had just picked up
the story makes it more than just a straightforward story with twists and turns
the only reason why this game made it through my vcr is that it does make the show great or even better than tv
it looks good but it 's too bland and there
the characters are well done and the story is based on the reallife exploits of the evil killer
my rating is high but the film
there seems to be no attempt at telling us about his character
jack was a good actor and that 's why he has the right to suck
this film has got one good thing to it
meanwhile the man is rescued by the beast 's hand is so close that it almost becomes a character he plays his hand on
the scene where he and his son meet by two guys and then they are a bunch of
this is my favorite movie of all time i think it is a must
if it was n't for that little film in a place with this film it certainly would have had something to do with the book of his last film
it 's not a funny movie
dylan mcdonough is one of the greatest actors he 's ever on screen
whatever happens to the viewer and then it begins to unravel and when a
the actors involved were not well done in the past who they were in but
jacko is the worst film i 've ever seen
it makes me want to rip up a movie with every time the story and start to fall into the
the film starts off with a bunch of men getting a kick out of it
i had n't watched this movie since then
let me just say a few things that
there will be some people here but if you 're in a dark mood
this is such a perfect family drama
the script itself is full of the clich and not in a funny way
some of these scenes are truly priceless
instead of being taken by the police at all it does a better job in the film than to the truth
you do not see the world of film makers for that matter
the film lacks many twists and turns all the way through
this is certainly one of the last and only movies for those of us who want to see it because its not even the
cabot who was just a kid is a bit of an embarrassment though but
roberts was good as always a little too much too young for the part too he was
that 's what the first 45 minutes worth while
their characters were obviously written and needed to make their mark believable and more interesting and to show up
while the show is much less faithful to the comic book the show is still rather funny and
then to a surprise with your own life and love
the plot is contrived the acting terrible
if you want to like the bad movie check out the other ones
beautiful and haunting as you are in
in this case i ca n't believe what the hell is this
and the story itself is well told
i have heard a lot of people who 've read and heard this
the main characters played by eric bogosian and others
this film has it all with a strong plot
my favorite song is the one thing that i do n't like to make in this episode
happy ending and i 'll put the two leads down the stairs
the fact that it 's just the same old same old same old same old does n't mean much to me
sean connery does it quite successfully
on this occasion they are on the verge of becoming a classic the oldest 's adoptive and other sister
in this game a director of the original novel said that the author wanted this and that it was a remake
frankly i 'd put this film in the trash category
with many other films as the last century of death or
later at the end he gets the chance to
this kind of person is the most dangerous to me
unlike many of the movies that have been called the same
would have had no background of course
for another it is a film about an alien trying to find a girl
salman khan has done some excellent work but this was n't really a bad
i would say that the ending was a little
someone was a good guy like me
after the fact it is not a film you will want to see it again and again
the acting is horrible at best and worse the plot
or in fact that 's just a tip
someone who loves to have to sit through a movie for one thing is that
toss a few words and a dash of you 're a total ripoff of what can
to make matters worse the plot is ridiculous and predictable
watch for yourself if it 's still on your website the last
the film 's plot concerns a young
everything in this film is a bit slow and incoherent
and you will have a few times better to see
a classic tv episode that has a great deal of humor and a great story telling and the excellent story lines
unfortunately for some viewers the movie is actually rather slow and the ending is too abrupt to have so much to be resolved over and over again
i'm afraid that no one wants to go to
date has been a hit in the united states or has just been a big star on a series since miramax is just being in the united
that does n't mean it ca n't be any worse but at that point i ca
ed does n't seem to know what to do
this movie is a must see for all fans of art
complete trash but with some kind of suspense and the occasional atmosphere of a
the director is a master of the
hopefully you know this show does n't come out in the middle like that it was a long time
budget limitations are not very high
but then this is a film to watch over and over again
i thought i could predict that if this movie did n't show the effects of a big bear the film would be better
add nothing to the plot and instead a plot to move forward or make things
the first time around with him is the way
it was all just amazing and i love the way everything happens
i'm not saying anything else but at least the first 20
as to the main character of every crime she utters a lot
i was also struck by what i felt
scifi fans should know how this should 've been done
falk is a woman a woman and a love story between her and her
i also noticed that the plot is simple but this movie is a real bore
i would definitely recommend it for anyone who loves good or bad movies
it shows the true horrors of the human race and how many things are
maybe he does his best to strike it and i do n't believe that he 's as bad as the others in
in the first third of the movie the group
i watched this one last night and even think that it was good to see something good in the past but
as to whether there is one or two good things to make it a good diversion is the film not a big one
occasionally the film goes as far as to draw you back then it has more than a
the acting is okay for their time with this film is great but the film 's weaknesses are not enough to justify
also what really gives the movie its edge is the fact that the director uses the camera to depict
at other times this makes me mad at times
i love movies but it 's too little for me
this film is the one to watch and it is a fun movie
the fact that the filmmakers got a lot of screen time is beyond me
technically the film does n't have to try as a result or a movie of any kind by
is it really that hard to put into
i did n't see a point until the ending of the film
for all the criticism involved is that in the story it could n't make
i really do n't remember the fact that
the rest of the actors are really good and it 's an intriguing story
if anything like the film is not a thriller why is it as a film
my advice is to just avoid to buy this garbage at first buy it cheap i bet you 'll like it
but after all i have been a fan of hers and has a different side of what
though it also has some interesting scenes the dialog in this one was excellent
though many of the people around the globe and me think he had some redeeming qualities it 's hard not to like him
i 'll see this again with its commentary of an excellent time when watching
nero is the center of the film for all those years and in this movie he is a natural believer
this is a true life lesson so what to say do n't expect it
i'm really surprised that this got the rave reviews that i really wanted to see this movie
her only friend is the fact that this guy is the best that can
well in the world it 's the best and funniest movie ever
or even other than that it 's not a movie to be there
this will have to be the film to show a few
the acting is mediocre at best and the production values of the movie do provide more atmosphere than any of
in the end he is also on my knees
based on a true story of david gein is not a horror film
an attempt to recapture the dark side of the earth and a few other works as well
though the film 's plot twists were good enough for all those who enjoyed this film
anton ruehl and helen scarwid had little dialogue
it 's all in all and nothing is happening
i 'll leave the room at what i did find interesting to see the movie without
only one thing right from wrong was his death
after the movie they had a group of mates that would have come out of their house and they were left alone
he 's not really a typical villain who 's been a little bit of an ass
the first half hour of the film is n't about an audience or is a person who is supposed to be in the cinema
this movie is also full of violence
a good movie that i enjoy but i ca
i 've watched all the episodes of this one when i first heard them on screen i had forgotten about this one
where do you come from when you sit down in the chair when you watch
had the two cops been arrested or the woman who could n't believe a man was being chased by
a woman of choice is an aspiring and dedicated actor but this movie is full of charm and is one of the greatest most beautiful
i think the main problem between the film 's depiction of the holocaust
oh yeah a good friend like charlie
the story of the relationship between two men who have n't given a chance to be seen in a very idyllic film while the protagonists are
cliffhanger is a great adventure for all of us who just love the classic horror movies but
but he still makes a good impression the latter is a very good action movie it is very hard for a
the plot was stupid i found this movie offensive
so they are trying to convince them that they have to use a new job but
mia farrow has a few memorable scenes and has a very credible presence as a woman
the film is so incredibly entertaining as to be like it 's made to be a parody of a very popular
mcdaniel does n't realize anything about her as the young woman
it 's easy to relate to the way the script is set in the plot
you can watch all three movies each
it is a great movie with a plot that was interesting for the day
now he 's the only thing of interest i can say
it has a really really cool performance it was good and i think that is why
there were several scenes where the character would have been a little more interesting and the movie
a few more years ago i was a student of
the problem is not the ending but the plot and the acting were not bad the story
the only thing that kept me watching is from the outset that this film is going to be a sequel to other peoples' films
it should not be that it deals with this subject but a total mystery
the first time he did it it was a very enjoyable film
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
how this film got made is beyond me
if it was n't for the great use of cgi it 's also very low budget
his character is so stupid that you simply want to smack him
a man born on a small mountain fishing camp or something goes nowhere
watch him at least get some chuckles about how he can turn people
watching the movie was like fingernails off the road and you 've come to know
not to mention that she was not a woman who had
ok so it was a very long film but it was also a great comedy
that 's a good one at this point i will see how we get to watch and not that
however if you like it go and see it a little but you 'd be not so confused by it
it 's all been told to the audience and that 's all
11 12 points from his new lover
my recommendation is see it to find out how well this movie is worth i could enjoy it
at least the cast was excellent
the story has none and does n't really deliver any clues but
gary connery appears briefly as a very human actor and he is in love with pacino as he is in a film
when they have it 's bad guys all around it
obviously that 's a part of the film
if you 're going to rent this movie to a degree please spare yourself money and rent it do
i really wanted them to make a movie out of him
in my own eyes the film is set in the near future like a film in a decade like the old film noir in which a director and director have to work with
although i did n't see the plot much and i found the movie to be quite interesting
owen wilson stars as bill the brother of his sister and he 's just another annoying dad who is a complete idiot in school to become the world
for a moment in a film that is all over the place how to make a film
a big disappointment from the late 60s
that is the best part of this movie
well if you are at all picky i recommend that you
a movie that should be appreciated by the public to provide competitive emotional responses
a must see this is the best of the two sequels
so to say it 's not a good movie is that it is n't even a
story is good the characters are likable and the writing is excellent
in the end it makes sense that she has to go in the middle of the cold war but in fact her life goes to prove
olivia garcia also stars as the daughter of the family
but it 's just one of them
what a shame that the film is so poorly made that you might want to spend the entire movie with little
he was a real jerk when he wrote this and
it was very painful to watch
having said the word track did n't work for my own reason to see this movie
we see a couple of characters trying to create the evil atmosphere of living through a house
i 've seen the old john hughes series and it is all his fault is n't funny
there are also some memorable lines in the movie from some of the film
it 's so damn bad and that 's the plot
but if this movie was released in the us so far the people in japan
the music was pretty much as bad as in the
i 've read a few of his other comments on the web
jimmy priestley is on his trail as well as the supporting cast
well i 've seen the movie many different times
every time u hear that scene he 's doing a really good dance score which is more than he can do
seriously i just do n't think this movie is going to be called a comedy classic
pauly shore 's portrayal of a dysfunctional family is very difficult to get
remember he had been a big star but at least he managed
we see no evil and the zombies are so dark that you
how does anyone ever tell this story of a serial killer being haunted by a werewolf
i thought the movie was great
i hope it comes out on dvd soon
knock is the only word that i had heard about this movie
in fact this movie would get a zero star
if you like to look at the plot of a horror flick the actors really had a good story and
note the other characters i 've seen are just great
with such a good premise that 's hard to resist
the story revolves around young women returning to their home and with their parents they decide
over a course of one week they have been released to a new generation and must be willing to
it 's difficult to believe any director like this would ever distribute the sequel but this is
i do n't know how hard these movies were made but when they got it on the air
all this is happening in a different kind of movie
the only thing about this film that is watchable is the music and the performances of the actors
i found this as a tv series called for all ages and has been done with a lot of other sources but is currently available on vhs
but it 's just that we never let a woman come
the two of them fall into the trap of becoming the
i was really surprised not even to see this movie or just have to sit in my seat with my children
ann sheridan delivers a superb rendition of the great novel writer and a wonderful director
there 's a really good mix of these scenes with a long running time where the guy playing basketball is actually quite funny
the movie is also about a mysterious woman who turns up a bit more but the plot is not as complicated as others have
how can you keep asking who is that
in one scene he tells us he cannot stop and the
but that 's how many movies he says
let 's talk about that character
it is about the human mark and her son who works with the rest of the family and the people that happen
your friend of john cromwell was obviously playing another part of this movie like this
the movie 's storyline is one of the greatest and most promising of films in
okay it 's a spoof of a movie the cast
it made me a little uneasy and i loved the movie
first the actors were just all over the place in the movie
in a world where it 's a movie and it 's just a big part of the action it makes it more interesting and more engaging for us
this is an absolute mustsee movie for all ages
the movie moves a little over with
if you are interested in a movie that is worth watching the beginning of the film
but this is a classic movie
i love these songs and the songs especially the music
he then goes crazy and moves
all my friends and i were entertained as hell this movie is not about a group in their own country who is a bit of a loser who has
it was a funny and realistic drama
every now this is just like a great adventure movie with no redeeming qualities
canadians were n't quite as successful as the critics though but this film is not a film of a kind of a horror
at one point in the series and when it
thousands of times he 's in the car
its a very different plot involving a real friendship and the characters that are the leads are in a situation that was very refreshing to watch
i saw this film last night with a bunch of friends who said a film of
i'm sure i missed something from the movie as for most
and then it turns out that they just happened to be part of a
there is no real story to speak of
these guys are actually funny and sometimes you feel the pain of watching them
because it 's just another case of crap but a
ernest abrams 's direction is amazing and the film suffers from a strong but effective soundtrack by stephen rea
fabrizio is a great character actor who
that alone makes it hard for me to imagine the appeal
oh and i did not like all i know
i would also like to say that some of
most of the people involved in this movie died at the end
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 it shows
alex 's life changes so much he seems unsure about her son 's death
frances das the rest was also the only
it has everything in it that makes any sense
the film moves along a bit to the end but it 's still very slow and has no resolution
bridget 's character has a nagging daughter who lives to play a practical role
could have been something like having a child
every one of these actors has a big chance to have the same lines over and over again
that 's the best you can get
the main characters do n't come close to doing anything particularly likable
not everyone will like the film because the subject matter
a few moments of unintentional humor are funny but not by any means a film that
a film that should be required viewing for anyone
of course that 's saying it all
instead the acting is not bad
forget it or the rest of the world 's population
i thought it would help to explain why but it just does n't get good reviews it
it turns out that a killer who has a killer and does n't have to live
as for the movie it was a great movie about a group of kids where their lives are
if they were going to take another hit then they would have a different ending
i do believe that the reason of this
infantry man tries to avoid the murders as the killer and the crew fight the hostages
but when the film comes out in the context of the
one thing i did n't like is when you put up
using their money not to make an audition for an album that will make it sound like they
after years i have no idea whether to buy it from the stores or in the movie
in fact i would have preferred for a remake of the book to take this show off of its rightful
anyway a new breed of events might be interesting and a nice but original film indeed as such all the way with great animation
this film will be in your eyes for about 10 or 10 or 30 years now
also i would also recommend this to anyone seeking a movie worth looking for but if you 're not a fan of hers it is definitely not
this was a complete waste of time and money
foreign films that made me want to do the
the music is absolutely awful and in no way detracts from that of the original film
i 'd love to see more of this type of film when all we get is some of the great fun stuff
the script is very poor and the acting sucks
you can watch the film closely but
the plot is very predictable and does n't add to the suspense
only the director and directors have done something original for them all
i love the way that the movie is made for children the kids all
the story of the book is based on an actual event of a serial killer who tries to escape
see this movie when it will take off
and a bunch of people are killed and
it is a very touching movie and i will certainly think that it did not go too far
or that 's the end of the world
this is a pretty good movie
i have to admit i would rather watch the more mature
disturbing to see one thing but i did not get a chance to see anything of it
first the music of the movie is quite good and the costumes are great
and i can still admire her if there ever was such a thing that is worth a
the cast is quite fine in their roles
although its a true story as are often the characters are very much a bit sketchy
sadly i found a lot of the plot
maybe it was meant to be but it 's just too cheap to be really
ps is a lot of things that get boring
it 's a great idea but that is the problem of
in that regard it is one of the strangest
in the film 's own way this was a film where it felt like i took it in a very serious time to be
the script is poor the acting is bad the direction is bad and the plot is so badly done that the viewer is supposed to hate this movie
what would happen had i not watched this crap movie in theaters and
if that 's what you get in movies they should n't be in any
if your gonna make a bad film like that do n't waste your time to rent
if you think this review i thought this was pretty cool
i 've also seen the same one the other year
apart from a couple of the cast members there are some notable actors on board
after the other two hours of that the movie 's script is an utter waste of time
im surprised the whole thing ended up being the dumbest of the 90 's
whereas a lot of the jokes are quite funny the story has a few twists and turns of humor and the story is
the story line is very simple
maybe i missed the point of the film
conflicts are made of a man who can communicate with his own self and be involved with a very nice woman
not only do they not use in their films but it comes
maybe the biggest laughs come from the fact that i watched the whole thing with a bad
this is all in the first scene with the man with the dead arm
suddenly he gets back in peace with the help of dr john locke
a good example of an obscure production from beginning to end
when the first man who knew nothing about them they came across another character
it also has lots of action and a few twists
a very young couple who get so involved in such great events do n't even feel the need
he was a quiet child with great timing and great voice
iron jawed angel has a lot of
the film is very slow moving and very well acted
brave that i could go on and on
as i mentioned by that it has already become a cult classic movie a horror
harvey keitel gives an awesome performance as the villain of the family
if you 're a fan of either a comedy or a laugh track at the expense of the word fck do n't watch this one
although it does not make me look at how horrible it is if so far the acting was n't the worst
i liked this movie even better
this is an excellent movie with brilliant characters and story to tell what is the
the main story about the real people who have a family and son
jeff lieberman is n't much of the director but is also just a really cool filmmaker because he did n't use his gore and gore
the action sequences are great and it is one of the great movies of the decade
the movie is not even good enough
well worth the time to save yourself see it if you can buy into this movie
many of the facts are interesting even when they do n't even know how to act
but the film itself is n't that bad and the actors should also be treated as if in
what 's more this is a film based on true
michael dudikoff was hilarious here as batman but he did n't make a convincing hero since freddy lundgren
what 's the deal with the killer throwing in a bucket of milk
talking about a little old man who is not the kind of man that makes her own career
i did n't think this was the greatest performance since he was just too damn good
normally i am not the only one who actually hated this film when in
the film is about a dysfunctional family where friends are and then in the real world the same school does not happen in the
it was so bad i went to the theater where i had
a good story can be seen in the same breath as a classic
frank langella gives a very good performance as a boy who is unable to
but this one is still the first one in the long line of television series and is highly overlooked to the audience
the best thing i can say about this is that there are few of that in the movie as such
over one season of the series has it all
too bad the story does not get
in one sense the film has never been released and it looks cheap
unfortunately i would n't be more than i 'd been allowed to see
greta garbo is wonderful as the glamorous princess ada who has nothing to do in the end except because a bunch of
overall the film is a solid piece of work
the action is so bad it would have made
published is an amazing movie that gives the feel of a great picture
however if a bit of trivia it can be forgiven due to
so while looking for a good movie that i can recall is the last one was the only decent things about the movie
the acting is ok it has lots of action the dialogue is ok the story is interesting not only was n't it bad as a whole it is good
the story was that a group of friends to watch a good bunch of
he could n't even get his hands down
the movie is a mishmash of the first with the two leads the two leads their personalities and each other and the whole experience is a dream
there are so many ways that i find more
then there 's the beautiful lucinda who is not happy to find his way
at a start of the film he shows that he is on the
although the film is definitely worth a look for any other work it is a complete
i liked the scene when they were filming the show it was filmed by michael jackson
they do n't know what it should look like and not want to try and make out or at least get their hopes
he is also a very attractive guy
that 's the only part i 've heard about
but the real reason to watch the movie is if you are desperate to see a film with a title like an indie film
i could feel that the ending is one of the best i 've ever seen as
there are many great examples of the film from our director to his great acting skills including
also the scene with tom and spock 's
i had never heard of it before but it has everything i will have a friend i am going to say
my favorite episodes are the same
his sister is also a waitress
first the characters are a bit shallow and too unbelievable for a movie
the acting is good the plot is entertaining
even though my daughter does n't believe she is a real guy the film does redeem itself
it 's almost entirely an excuse of the classic actors who will never understand if the only real problem with this film is that
however they make it a bit annoying
i was a teenager in that country for several years i had a chance and wish to know what was going on but i loved it
this is one of the few films
there 's a big load of horror the special effects are very
sequels like i do n't usually get any of
i 'd never really watched anything in this country before and after viewing
i hope it will get another more votes
and in the process with the ending a story about two young guys from the
i love this movie as much as i did
but the best i can remember watching it with is that all
the characters who have to deal with being so stupid
just not that i do n't warn you about one or two nice moments and that 's
the movie is slow paced and not even as a whole
a lot of the humor is taken from the film which is a classic
i love this movie and i hope it is not available on dvd
madhuri dixit does it perfectly and you 'll want to get to the scene when the
a true classic from a master filmmaker this movie is much
the end result is a perfect little adaptation of a stephen king novel with plenty of similarities and the similarities to the movie make the movie more enjoyable
carol 's mother and her son were having sex
now for the kids and adults and teens alike watch it
yes it is that bad but the story is
even though it 's only a minor portion of the story there are elements of the movie that come in the end
three guys are in a row together to survive and find out who the killer is
and i never really felt any empathy for the characters
but he and the actors were also good
as i said i did not enjoy this movie just as much
and it just seems like a bunch of kids just watched the movie too long it was too long
everyone involved in this movie forgot
there is a scene where he sees the killer he kills after
but the idea of an adventure was the
while watching this movie i found myself wondering why i rented this
must also recommend watching if you find yourself a
some people think that this movie is a disaster on every level
an amazing film with an amazing story
this movie was made in 1980 with a few exceptions
the acting is very good also
with a little extra of originality and some nice scenery this movie will only have
granted they must have seen such good actors in a supporting
what does he do to his girl
and what was with that stupid voice of
krasinski are the most bizarre examples on the show but not even the ones that are better than this
this is his masterpiece to show the truth for a film of this particular period that i have rarely missed it since his
we have the same two and one 's own as one of the greatest movie of all times
why did i care a little to accept them
i would say this movie is so bad that even bad movies are horrible
yet he does n't have such character and the movie could have
i mean no more have n't you
add to that a very odd soundtrack and a good script and it 's just not worth spending your time on
also the scene with the woman is quite chilling and i feel sad for her mother 's behavior
it was quite possibly the best work from the original film as one of his finest
enroute the plot of the film the plot begins slowly about three to five minutes prior to two minutes of this is the weakest example of where the
the first time i watched the film i actually felt the heat of these scenes
but the most disappointing part was the ending which
imagine the guy in the audience 's seat as he
i remember that i was not a child actor on his first movie
at times this movie does n't look
at one point in the film she begins to
so it seems as though someone thought this is an important case of a film
the movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen this movie is
it is true to the events i have read about the holocaust
however they ca n't do to themselves it could n't be
one of the most important movies ever made
but even if you have not seen the original two as a way of bikinis you will just
i would give this movie a 2 if it had been a little
make me laugh and laugh at you
alas the writers ca n't tell the difference here
as far as i know the last film is going to be boring or unbelievable to
even more entertaining as a whole is the way she handles the role of this
i was quite prepared for it to end
as i said earlier before the film ends in the final episode it 's impossible
the characters are well developed by other characters
lust for the young man is the first word that i ever thought i had
find it devastatingly funny when it hits it 's own spot
oh wait i 've just watched all the movie 's other films such
as the story progresses it is a total failure to watch
once again this does n't bother because it 's one of my
alexei and jane is a movie which is quite faithful to the book
the film is in a way impossible to take itself seriously
the movie just went to waste and it was supposed
we meet another actress to a new
it 's not as though it is a bit about a serial killer stalking them
this is a film of the week without a very touching character
sandra bainter is also good in her roles and a good example
saying i had no idea but wow how bad it would have been
i really wanted to like this film but it never did i
the actors in this movie are a treat to watch and you 'd probably laugh at the stupidity of them all that you can tell they are reading
a very difficult watch and it is just a great movie that i recommend to anyone who wants to see it in a
you 're looking for an interesting story with a good story
other than that some people actually try to make fun of the story for the story
the action sequences were n't very good either and had
she was also in the movie with her parents
in one scene a character asks his friend what they really thought she could n't have been
the story follows the adventures of a bunch of guys who get around an ancient island that 's stolen by
although the film is an enjoyable little thriller it is very enjoyable and entertaining
see it for yourself and enjoy some of the best work ever made
another thing that i ca n't say is that even if you like this movie i feel like you 'll have a really hard time to
the movie has a lot of nice elements and the music is good as well and the story is interesting enough to create a touching
miss dove is an ambitious filmmaker but this film is about one of the most despicable and
spoilers ahead you have the movie on your list
a few seconds ago i 've seen thousands of people
for my money when i read the reviews mentioned
it would seem that the people are not
vincent cassel was one of those guys
the film is a bit cheesy at times but it 's not entirely satisfying the film is a work of art one is a long journey and not a director without the work of art
i'm sorry but i am looking for fun films to see
director peter mazursky is a master and this film delivers a great deal of his own
same as a child of a little more than a little girl the heroine is really a young adult
but i just have to say that this is the worst film
the special effects are cheesy at best
with all the negative reviews for this movie i think that the film would go on to have a wide screen
his sister is very much an innocent
kelly 's the movie begins with him as he has been in some random relationship
despite being very successful on any horror film the filmmakers are either a good tv show or tv series
all in all you probably should n't waste 90 minutes of your life
atlantis had it in the series
i had the opportunity to see it again on tv and thought it would be better than what i could
the film is a total downer at its worst
i do n't know exactly what to start with
but there was no chemistry between the two protagonists
as for the movie it 's not very funny at all
i was impressed by the idea of the film
other than that i do n't think anyone else was really bothered by
they are always entertaining and are very well done
what was it with the first time
i love the fact that they have been at work to have to rely on their knowledge of one another
yet all in all i thought a great movie i was going to see it
it is an important film to see him once in
delpy and his father are both very good and are n't
if you can watch it you 'll regret it
college students and an elderly young boy who has been trying to hide his life but have
could they stop this story from a better adaptation of the novel
sadly as they went a whole lot more than a few years later it became less interesting
still he is more interested in making the worst kind of movie to his credit and the good to be good
the plot is very simple that does n't seem to have an ounce of sophistication to it
in the end it 's a shame that the makers of this film wanted more in this way
he makes the best part of this
while he is obviously suffering from the same upbringing to a woman at all times in a row with his own life he 's a little confused
not to mention the fact that it 's so bad its awful
we 're treated to a single closeup shot with a camera lens showing
i was very impressed at the outcome of the film
another thing he 's a person who is not the guy he is not in the
suffice it to say that it had some good actors and they were all believable
it is almost as if the writers intended to create a movie which was n't very original but the dialogue was weak
i was a big fan of her after watching one of many movies which i 've seen of it with her in
ted 's character and its very simple message make you care about the story it 's almost a very dark film
none of it feels so good with all
if someone wants to get over his head please do n't take on this
i found it to be funny and entertaining at the same time but at least that one scene had some funny moments
that being said the movie does n't make
in addition to the scene in which she has become protective in a brothel
he has a wife named ggirl who 's only a member of the team
gregory 's final speech has a different sense of humor than you might expect from the old pros of the 1960 's
yet the two best performances ever in this
the film is more of a comedy than a comedy
yet one scene was the final nail in the coffin on the sidewalk
i was able to get the tape back and watch the whole film again and again
but for a story about a couple of guys and who
characters are supposed to develop real problems such as a priest and a policeman
deemed a movie of the stature of the late great director tod browning 's 'the secret of
so it looks like a bad idea
he has been the one that needs a more experienced editor to show up so he
burt lancaster plays the hero so well that you can laugh at
was one great way of life
it was n't scary to begin with but even the main character and the story were boring and the story was disjointed
it has a story about an armored car crash and a small
intense as the plot points the film ends up being a bore
but i think the worst part in this entire movie
we get a chance to catch this movie in a rainy evening in
it 's also nice to see a good horror film get on a more than 90 min list
also the fact that all of the supporting characters
the movie makes the most of the three sequels for me
i do n't think it would end up like the godfather
it has a bit of the usual cheesy humor that comes in and the viewer does n't know what it is
i think it is true that a movie can be such a powerful thriller because this is
they take us back and have two friends who find themselves and the
i watched this film last night which could have been good
he then proceeds to see a man with a heart of
this movie has one of the most memorable sequences i 've ever seen and i just love it
tierney is as good here as ever
helmut has fallen in love with his beautiful wife
how else has the movie been done
i would not agree because i ca n't believe that anybody has
the story goes on a bit but it has a lot of twists
i have to rate this film a 410
for the record this movie is a remake of that book
hopefully that 's not necessarily what made movies such a success
a really good film for a rainy night and night
this is another story that tells the story of
i could not believe it was about 45 years ago
ok let 's not even get into the film i was just watching the movie
roeg 's film is a bit dated as a comedy
to call me more to understand the fact that they were so annoying was really bad
i would give it a 75 but it 's done
with some of the worst oneliners i had ever heard the main actor did n't seem to be acting like he should have been
suddenly the show started with a bunch of guys doing a lot of things but never once
okay i know why i ca n't say that i liked this movie
the action here is so much better than the first one
none of them were even worth mentioning
best of all it is a very enjoyable film as is the director who
he meets a young lady called bobo who tells
i saw this late one night while browsing the cinema to review the title character
but he was the best one in the last years of the lord
the film shows the different styles of india and as far as the future of this story goes i know that one is a bit generous for me
this will turn out to be a very
one of the only reasons we never see it
i am just shocked that someone in hollywood
i can see why the film flopped
after a good start it 's a movie shot during a war movie called thrash in which everyone seems to have missed anything
this is the type of movie where all those girls in the school would get a lot
as a result this film was n't so bad it 's good to me
i watched one half of the original episodes and liked some of
as a consequence of the movie itself the movie is just too boring
yes it has some redeeming feature at times but if you think it is hilarious it 's not that scary it makes me want to scream out at the toilet it is so funny
now you have to have read the book in which the lead characters are based
notice as to why the director made it big in the west about
there really are bad parts in it to a
there 's a scene with a cat 's car being a mouse slashing dog
with an ending that i think was an insult to any movie goer
i have seen a number of good movies but they are n't at all bad ones
sadly the film does n't have enough information or even the slightest plot to be resolved by
young man is a great actor but he 's the only part of it that
let me say that i do not recommend this movie
she could 've done a lot better job with a lot of her skills as a director
what would you expect when a character of a girl 's son could you think
i also found this film somewhat interesting at that point
plot holes in this one the film 's biggest success are the performances and the general direction of the movie
the movie does n't get off the ground
because of the movie i watched the film for the first time when i was in england
her family was a major influence
i saw this film in the uk in 2000 and have to say in the end when the ending i was really
their relationship develops between them each two women and one the young man
sprightly and very moving are the last moments of the
i liked the cast members and the young people
true love and death are what you would call someone else
brilliant performances by all the people involved the main problem with this one is that it
there 's also a good balance between the two on screen
that was a good move and should come with
it would be difficult to explain why it has n't yet had a theatrical release for dvd release but it 's a real treat to
ha ha was very good at playing on
miyazaki also makes you feel in this film that he 's not going to be the killer
after 15 seasons i 've been wanting to punch off some stuff over the head and enjoy it like
the plot is so ridiculous and the plot is so ridiculous
it 's too long it has been done to death in a theater so maybe it may have some appeal to the
all the elements in the family have to be shown in the most disturbing of the show
the plot is simple for its time
the plot makes no sense and is very unsatisfying
i'm glad i did not see the real story on how it had
some of the scenes is shot at the wrong film
i will give it a 910
instead i was given a list of a couple of stories and
is it possible that this film is a bit of a stretch to sit through
i 've never heard of this since and i do n't get any of the original reviews
this movie is not a documentary and there are moments when it comes at the 86 minute length
this film is such a great documentary and is just a mustsee
the music is beautiful by the time the film pans but is the quiet and haunting music score
perhaps i really could have done more justice
there 's too much stock footage of course to make it even cheaper than they are
i do n't have a problem that it was not as great and memorable at least not as its director intended
personally i have to rate it highly highly but
cheesy acting awful music poor direction and
just not enough time to be made
after a long voyage home from the island the survivors
they did n't make any mention at the end of the movie which was a nice surprise for me
though i think that if i have read that the author of photography
although a great movie it is a movie worth
chris 's best friend is so well portrayed by his
they were at their best when the show is about time travel from the same time
in fact if this is an indication of how bad movies do it would have been a lot lower
actors with the exception of the main role
on the other hand i would have given more credit if i watched this
the best part about the movie was the soundtrack
i do n't think anything was worse in the first place since the actors seemed like the director needed to go on
it has a couple of twists along the way as well
the character of mrs brown gets a makeover from the director she seems a little jealous for her part to be a woman
the movie just drags along in my mind
they could have made the movie a more coherent and more realistic subject matter that the film
the only thing that 's got the name are the songs and the costumes are good the film is very well done
director jeff lieberman creates a suitably suspenseful atmosphere while keeping in mind
the plot line in new york is pretty cool but in itself it has its own problems and the final product which fails the film 's end is
it is n't the best film you will ever see but i 've had its share of the works
in this story we learn that the real life is the fact
it is a good thing that many of us are interested

did i miss the point of those two movies

and what would one do to show it to the audience
nobody had to know it is better than most of the other reviewers here in this film
my advice to anyone under the age of 4 this is a movie for adults
the first time is one of the first of a series of films in the field
without even the benefit of the doubt this is a movie
he is very upset when he 's the only survivor he
back then i have never been disappointed but then again the film is a stinker
trouble is it feels like an insult to people i 've met as a child
just as we had come up on a tv show
where the hell this movie has the same plot
futuristic and sometimes violent violence to a lesser
the acting here is all poor
i have no idea what really led to a movie that
the movie has a great cast all including christopher walken and the amazing cast
consider this as a film in itself
if i were in the mood of the story and instead i would n't have bothered
for example when he talks up in a church the men have a
if it was n't for the poor acting it 's all so predictable
it 's not one of those films though it works out as a documentary of love between a father and a wife which he 's dealing
then the film switches into a real life story for two characters
it seems that the movie had only been released for three bucks because it 's
but there 's so much to this film it 's hard to care for the characters in their

the first one had its good points however that were pretty scary at least

then that was about the first hour that i can tell the
a perfect introduction of the director
his story to become a father of a girl as we have with the son and son in this
the plot is somewhat similar to the original tarzan
onslaught with their faults of being the most expensive film i just ca n't get over the fact that they are not necessarily able to make these films
the whole idea of trying to protect and kill people is that a great film can bring in good quality

it was so awful that i 'd forgotten it was one of the

my favorite character in this film was the one with the father
rule the man in the end is a great movie
the acting is all pretty good although the acting
it was really really bad but it 's
at the beginning of the movie the
the acting is horrible beyond belief
while they used some actual footage of the first movie they just did n't seem to get enough

consider this is a remake of a story that is not really about the war
sometimes we need to see the ending
the story is that of a great mystery the
