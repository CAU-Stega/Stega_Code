she was so beautiful in her part that she was a joy to watch
i do n't think i 've ever seen so much
the characters in all the episodes were just great and the
audiences of the period will find this very unusual
a few of the characters are just so bad and so lame that i could not bear them
too bad he has never made a better film but
the director tries to explain the story of the film the same as i
of course in some of its minor moments it 's a little slow but the final product and the ending left me with
i 've always enjoyed this show
interestingly enough the script is also not funny as if it were written by
some viewers have commented on the respectability of what the film has to say about it and
but this time i am a lifelong fan of the tv and the series that aired to
vincenzo 's direction for this film made me want to know the real story behind the film and it has some of the best performances of
the film is a total mess with no story about the plot it 's just an excuse
but i 've only seen her in the
the film also does n't get as boring as it can get
perhaps that is why this movie is not for everybody
at the same time i was n't convinced that they were
no matter what to make a profit the director 's cut is very
all the same i will say about this movie
i was impressed with this movie
2001 's classic novel is also a very entertaining film
she is the perfect example of a man in his family
he plays the part very well
let this movie go straight out to anyone who has a sense of humor
how did it become so long ago
let 's start a trip to the house of the great hulk hogan
this is a movie about a young
the whole story of the killer is not the same
mitchell does n't have to deal with the fact that he does a better job of the movie
sadly the acting was very much worse and the movie could have been
no matter where i was going i was just thankful the film had ended
the film 's only saving grace is the casting of james cagney as a
watch this movie you will probably be very pleasantly surprised
i love the movie so much that i was really hooked
of course they have n't taken it and they will find a way to make a profit
it 's a shame that it is never released in the us as
what is really amazing is the director of the movie
what we 're presented to us is just plain
definitely an absolute mustsee for fans of westerns
as the film continues and its plot turns to a more gripping climax there 's a very interesting ending that
it 's a film that has some truly creepy images
i 've been there to tell the people who are n't as stupid or ugly but what we are left with are the characters
if you want to see a good movie about the hardships of slavery this
it is very very much a love story between the two men
sneakers is not one of those movies that is a total waste of time
there was also a scene with a lot of the other guys in the car
well there is a reason that it was not the case that the movie is n't
2 this movie would have been a hit on the head of the great director of john woo
certainly the weakest thing about it was his ability to bring tears to life and in some scenes the viewer would have cared a little if they were not
i think there is a lot of action
whilst the movie is about a woman who becomes a little over her own the abuse is more interesting
this movie will be very much for you
look at least a dozen things to have made a big budget
and this film is n't a very interesting one at
persuaded for it he gets into a fight between his son and his family and his wife who has the ability to become the leader of the gang
this is definitely a movie to watch if you 're a
i'm glad i did n't see this movie
i think the main point of this is the film
maintain my own prejudices and beliefs
i was very glad to read a review of this film and decided
finally the whole idea of what the writers of this movie could do with
the acting in this movie is just horrible
sure but the real star of the film is the beautiful rachel taylor as mary
in this case the film has a very unique look
he gets to do a decent job
the acting is ok but the directing is good
henri was an excellent movie about what was the best and most challenging and
even after his mom dies we get a glimpse of his character who is in his early twenties a bit of a psychotic father
i think the filmmakers wanted the movie for the best
it 's not only a little bit of a thriller that does n't make any sense
it 's really a film about a very troubled father and daughter who come together in a life of two different factions
like many films of our time it did have a message of being made and in fact the acting was so awful
in the end i thought it would be a good idea to take an old man who could have been
actually i was n't bored to death or i was a fan of hers or i 've never got the chance to see the whole movie i
his only redeeming factor is that he is able to play a character and does a little bit
fortunately that 's what makes the picture such a success
i just watched the movie and did n't have high hopes and i thought it had potential as well
the acting in the movie seems to be an afterthought
you will find yourself laughing aloud when the
after the first hour of a movie i was very bored and wanted to see the whole mess and the plot was so good
the acting is awful except for the lead character and a few other things he 's a pretty
the movie is very boring and very slow
obviously the story is that bad but the acting is pretty good
im sure the film had a bit of an ending but the ending was really too abrupt and boring
any normal man of note might find this a classic
better luck the movie is a bit different
this film is a total stinker
the film begins with a bang with several shots and a shot of a bunch
they 're just plain ugly characters that are n't in the movie just the typical clich of all
the director has a lot of problems in making films like this
the film 's premise is as usual a lot less than two or three hours into the story and the characters are n't even remotely interesting at all
just to be fair to this movie there is a little too much
but in fact they could n't have done more
it 's the same damn movie that made the earlier movies that were made and starred in the movie with the
i ca n't understand how this movie was released theatrically so many times
the movie takes a very long time for the
from the get go i find the whole thing fascinating
meanwhile the main character becomes an angry mother
it 's a little confusing to see a man like alexandre who is a bit of a stereotype
she is a good man and a very good actress
let 's face this movie the movie is
i 've seen a lot of movies but not for those who have
in this case i do n't really know why the director would n't be able to take the whole premise out and
mother and son have a mutual respect for each other
they are not in any way connected in a way that
they make this film a success to me and i must confess that they do not have
but in the case of a man she 's
love was one of my favorite
as for the characters i feel that this movie is more of a family movie
i love the fact that he is a good actor even though he was n't given enough screen time to show
this is the type of film i 've paid a visit
but it is not a bad movie but in
while this may be the story of a man who has lost his wife 's family and the other two friends in his life
saloon girl has a wonderful look but
an example of why this film is the best in the world
i have to say that this movie is the worst movie ever put together
unique and very funny and the story of how the young girl and
love story the adventures of the men who have been married to a woman
not only is the plot a bit of a mess it does n't have its fair
i thought the movie might have been much funnier
it 's the same thing he makes of a movie that makes you think
personally i 'd rather watch a documentary than
this is the type of film that 's supposed to be a horror classic but it 's a
dante the director 's editor should have given up his movie career and said this one is the funniest of all the movies i have seen
it is difficult to believe it 's supposed to be a parody of the same genre that
mixup is one of his best films that he has done for years
before she returns to the apartment she becomes an obsessed
for some reason they did the same
the only thing that really bothered me was this
much less of the same can be said about the plot
the acting is horrible and there is zero chemistry between the characters or the action
next time i was watching it
it is an example of how the director 's script is in the book and what happened when a person died in his life
but he ca n't be bothered
absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen
it is as simple as that
the story is about a group of young boys who are
and the story line is a joke and the movie is
the movie is n't very funny and is very dull and is n't funny
first of all it is a great example of how it will be in the theaters
there were no other characters so no real plot development
this was one of the few movies i 've seen in
we can only hope that some will see it
suffice to say that the movie 's main focus on the film was that he tried to cram humor into it 's
first of all it does seem so long for some kind of
the film is set in south asia
the film is so bad that i ca n't imagine any other actor who ever existed at that time
an odd plot involving a very young man who wants to find her way into town but she 's left to find a job and
he has the same ability to get a glimpse of the life we have with this film
i thought the film was so well written
kurosawa 's film is n't too bad to
to be honest i found myself wishing i had watched another movie
it was a very poor film
the film was pretty awful but it has many faults
you will never want to read the book but do n't expect a movie to be a classic as a kid
now i'm gonna start with the fact this is the first episode of the show and it shows what
some viewers will like it as much as i did
the movie is also very similar to the first and i did n't really care
roaming a bike on a plane with some kind of hand
what was a great movie was
i was n't really expecting much from this movie until
if this had happened to be a major flaw of the production it might have been great
in this episode i was n't a fan of the show
his performance as a young boy is the closest to the character
still you get to know the man that you 've seen earlier in his life
some are the most obvious aspect of the film
zanuck and the cast do very good jobs but the film is filled with pointless dialogue
beware and a few other films that are better than this
i 've seen this film a number of times so i
but i did n't think the movie was going to be too gory
the acting is good and the direction is excellent
i thought this is an excellent film
instead we just get the feeling that we 're supposed to believe that the movie is about to happen
the movie is very slow and the acting is just as bad as the
they are so much better than they did and it was obvious that they were trying to save the movie from the film that
director david cronenberg has produced a few good films with the exception of a great filmmaker of his type
the movie is set in new orleans
my only negative criticism is that the movie has a bit of
probably one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen
joan blondell is very good in her supporting form and in this film she is excellent
a good story line and a few good
a film that 's so good that it makes me question a question and i did n't want to see
this movie is n't a great movie
sure there is not another aspect of the film that does n't make a lick of sense
he 's supposed to be the killer that killed the dog but he ca n't stop the girl he
it is about a very different woman who was
it 's the story of a very
in fact it 's just a little bit too easy to figure at once at a film school that the viewer might
the movie has a little more than its share of moments which are
never mind that they are talking about their love
the film is also about a woman who has her heart and her life in the country
no other actress has ever known for a film
it also showed the real problems of how the world war 2 ended
it is a film i would never watch again
ah what do you expect a film where the hero is a jerk or a hero or is there anything more to
of course the only character is to be one of the three characters
a film about a bunch of people
another thing i did not have was the music but i did
not to mention the fact that i was watching a movie with that little plot about it
this film is a complete insult that is what makes you
now i can find that the movie is a waste of celluloid
i really enjoyed how the movie got the censors it was in fact that i
not only that but it is still one
uncle america is the kind of person who has just lost his wife
on the flip side the film follows the adventures of four couples in a dysfunctional family
the actors are so bad that in many words the director tries to hide
yes the story is well written and the plot is intriguing
today the filmmakers of the show have never had to write the script which is more than a little convoluted
she was at least one of the most likable actresses i have ever seen
and in fact that was a lot less
the film is not about the same kind of thing as the original
sad in the movie and i would n't recommend
it is a great movie that is
aside from the first few of the episodes the film is just a bunch of random
i would n't even give this movie a 7
i saw this at a preview screening for a long time and i still found myself wishing it would have
fortunately she is still in the film and she becomes
i just wish they had done their version more well because the characters were just a bunch of characters from the book
ok so i am an expert i do not understand and is a bit harsh
when his mother 's son dies and begins to take care of him his mother 's suicide is so bad and so lame
it 's hard to say that the
also it 's all about him
at the same time the characters are in full force and they just have fun
the first and most obvious i saw in the theatre was this is the worst movie i have ever seen
sure the movie does n't have a lot of action but the
i love to have a little more time but this film should have been called
it was a very good movie and i
campbell wilson is so good in the role of a preacher who has a crush on him as a father of his son
my friend and i all laughed so early during the film
i thought that the characters could have been very funny
it could have been done in a
unfortunately for her and her mother it seems that
i just found it hard to believe that the entire family could have been
the film is not a documentary
it was one of his best films he was able to pull off the part in which she 's a bit over the top but her character was so strong she does
ivan van patten is very talented and he 's
sue is a wonderful actress and is an intelligent character actress who has a strong charm
i was n't really impressed with the first fifteen minutes
his acting is horrible and in his attempt
kidnapping me as the movie was a waste of time
analyze the movie for a moment that is actually very funny but
i'm a fan of the genre but i do n't care what
the movie has very few interesting characters in the movie
this movie also shows up in a small village with a couple of guys with no legs for a few seconds
however this is all the movie about
do not confuse the people with the same review
i saw it at the toronto international gay cinema fest in the uk when it was broadcast and had a very pleasant family
channel 4 is n't just a tv show
let it suffice to say that this is a good and very good movie
maybe that 's why it does n't
as the movie unfolds and a young girl goes from a home town to a mental breakdown
some may disagree that they are in the minority of movies but i
it 's a movie about love and relationships that we all have to deal with
i was n't impressed with the plot and the acting
oh and by the way this is a complete ripoff of the original
since i have been to the area
the film is very similar to the earlier films and also the one that
yes that 's right it would 've been a lot better if the movie had been more interesting but the story line is so poorly
it is the ultimate message of life
and why is this movie so popular and so far
also there are some pretty nice touches of dialogue and some scenes are in the trailer
the acting is horrible and the acting is just below average as the acting was n't
okay that 's exactly what you 're looking
hell i love the fact that these are the movies
its a waste of time if you can find it
the story of the mother of four young girls is a mystery drama that has
time has come to shove in the
this is not a horror film it 's
that was the only reason why this movie was so
the film starts out well with a lot of twists and turns
the film is set in a very small town and the sets are often very cheap
he also has a knack for taking a trip in which he is forced to kill the people from
of course she 's not a very
well i can forgive the movie because i ca n't tell
now the two guys have some weird moments together in what appears to be
both women are a little too common though and there are plenty of other movies that should have been
therefore the film is about a group of women who have an affair and the film begins
the story is a mishmash of events in all respects and is simply
it is a real treat from all
this movie was a very good movie i thought it 's going to be the biggest star wars movies i
why not have a director that 's making a film like these
that 's the only complaint i 've had for the whole film
is that really the movie the point you 've seen about it
and the music is very bad the soundtrack is horrible to me
the movie has a lot of twists which is a nice thing to say when we get to the end of the film and it 's very interesting at times
you will also love the movie but i would give it a 1 for that
clearly the movie does have a lot of problems but it has the same level of style for those who know that there
also the ending is a bit abrupt but
that 's just what you can
in a way you would know something about it and you are left feeling very sorry for the actors
but i ca n't say this is a classic
there is no real plot there is no excuse you must feel it
furthermore the movie is not as funny as the first and as long as i had missed all its flaws it is n't the best
the characters are all interesting and believable
legendary actors do not appear to be the real person in the movie but he does have a bit
no one is going to get a chance to make this a movie
my son and i saw this movie and i was so disappointed that it was rereleased
the plot is simple and is interesting enough but the
the main character is a woman who is constantly pregnant
add to the mix an eerie atmosphere of the movie 's atmosphere and of course the music
at least it 's an attempt to make the audience laugh
this movie is n't a total waste
as a fan of this series the show is not nearly
let it be on the top 250 if you are a fan of the
parents will not regret this show
it is just a good movie that will be lost forever on the dvd
the plot is about something very real and it has a very good story
entertainment value of horror movie is n't a bad
far too long for its failings the only two of the three characters who seem to have been a caricature
when i started watching this show i felt that they had just wasted an
plus it was a pretty funny movie especially the one time
that is the reason why he made it into a movie
or in one way or another
it 's a good film that you might enjoy
charlotte rampling who is very good also
we get a glimpse of the relationship between the
obviously a bunch of people who want to spend their vacation in a big city building are n't very happy
she just does n't have anything going for it
the only saving grace for this movie is that it is based on an actual book that is actually quite good
not just for kids not kids
basically it is the same thing we had to get through
joel schumacher has done a good job of bringing the show into a whole different mood but is n't too
i 've also liked this movie and i would not have to watch it
imaginative acting from john rhysdavies and robert ryan who plays both his character in
we never really learn that his mother is in love with a child but she is n't happy in the world as being her
it does n't seem like they would have been much more on the show
in a way it 's so bad that i almost lost my sides from the beginning
from the opening scene to the end you 're hooked
the actors in this film are great
this movie was a perfect example of how a movie about an american
talk out of the ordinary for the movie to be a bit of a cult classic
i would suggest that this is the only thing that
only the people who thought this was a great film should be ashamed and to see for all the wrong reasons
of course we 're not supposed to feel that way too much in order to understand the plot
but that was n't the point of what they would be if the
but that 's exactly why the filmmakers decided to make
garbo is also the main character to be a star and actress she portrays a
this was a film that was a perfect combination of comedy and
out of nowhere this movie really did n't end until the end of the movie
occasionally i was disappointed at the time that the director of the movie was a fan of a story
an interesting one is an extra bonus
this film shows the true life of people who live in
this movie is a real masterpiece
the plot is a complete mess and i have nothing to recommend it
the movie starts as the movie picks you off into the woods with the
in fact the film has some great music score
soldiers were very good and could n't stand on the outside
the film also feels as though he is enjoying the movie as a whole
suddenly he meets a girl and they fall in love with a very strange
as for the story it 's not as funny as it is a very funny film but
for example when a man is walking out of her car he looks like a cross between a rock
before the final shot i was a little hesitant to see what happens at the end
if you want to watch the film with a couple
turner and the other performers deliver this film
it does n't take a lot to realize the director and director
i have to assume that he was one of hollywood 's most prolific actors to date for all he did for paramount and his career
basic instinct is a story about the holocaust that
and this is where the movie starts off
that was a lot of my advise
the film 's title makes no excuses to be a film
i think this movie was a joke
he is a very bad film
ruggles and pressburger have created a wonderful comedy
the characters are all good and the script is
a lot of the humor is just flat as the movie is a bit of fun to watch but i
i do not care how anyone who 's been interested at that time would want to watch a movie that makes this movie a must
was this a very interesting idea
grace for the first time as an actor
the plot was pretty stupid and the acting was horrible
obviously this was n't a good choice for the writers to have their brains cut out to the point of
but if you have seen the original and do n't think that 's too good it is an
the film is a masterpiece but the acting is superb
this is a very bad film
he should n't have done it again
needless to say the script is full of
direct from the start of the film i was n't impressed by any
a few scenes are not the usual one with the usual
the cast is n't bad and the plot was
possibly the worst of the three series of films
firode 's character development is not very convincing
it is a film that i can appreciate but it just goes way far
one of my favorites though is that the story revolves around a young woman who goes to the
yes there 's no plot and the
before i begin watching and read the book a friend of mine i had not read about the book for this adaptation
it 's like a documentary but i do n't like the original but i have to disagree with
i was n't looking for an accurate adaptation of the book
that does n't matter too much as a film of the type where all the action happens in the beginning
reanimator has been released on dvd as soon as the original and as soon as it 's available
the script is pretty lame as it lacks
i am a huge fan of the original series
evil dead was the first film i enjoyed the first three sequels but i think that the second is the sequel to the sequel
the main character of the story is about the son
i do n't know why it is the best but it 's a movie that
heck what does you expect from a movie about a bunch of people who try to steal money from their bank for themselves
i have seen many of the series that i 've seen for the first couple of years and never forget that
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
now there is a certain sense of humour
as a result of their lives of the two
the story of a young woman who moves from a small
good acting good direction great music lots of action scenes and a good story
oh yes the movie is an enjoyable experience in itself
if you want to make fun of the original it 's just great
there is something about this movie
at this point i can not believe a film is a masterpiece of art
it also seemed to lose its footing with
martin landau was also very convincing as the cop and the movie had no point where everything was
to say this is my favorite movie is n't my idea of this movie
this time the movie begins with a young woman
though the movie is quite good it 's almost an hour long movie
the film has a great cast and it 's a great performance by willis
so he gets a lot of money and his car is used in
fred willard who plays the main character has an affinity for the role of a hitman who believes he is the best
developed as a vehicle for a movie that had an audience with such a great concept it
also it would have been a good film in the hands
the plot of the movie is about an english couple who
i think a lot of movies were made
i'm a fan of the original series of films such as this i think
i really like her and have n't seen a lot of her other films
the film does n't need a strong plot or
then i had a headache and this was a good show
this is a film that does not go unnoticed at all
if you can find the uncut version with a restored version available on vhs for purchase dvd or vhs and dvd
i think the filmmakers have a lot of fun making this so i 'll give it a fair score
although some of the dialogue is not as bad as they would have been in an attempt to get out of the film it 's
off screen i thought was the coolest movie i have ever seen
the music is also very very very good and some of the scenes are well done and the scenes are great
only a couple of minutes are spent a lot of time
this is a story of a young boy who is caught
he is also very convincing and makes up for it very well
a lot of the plot and the characters are very good but not all of them are very memorable
costner 's character was the epitome of one of the best
arthur and andre are the same as they are with each other and
they are all very talented but they do
i would have known that this was a very poor movie
i would have loved to see more of them in a row or a dream and the movie could
when a young man is killed and taken away the whole time and he
claiming to be an old fashioned tv film with the same director and a couple of actors who have no choice but to play their parts of the movie and their work it works very well in the movie
the plot is n't even that good
i am a fan of david lynch but i think you
it 's a very funny and clever comedy and i do like the way it is portrayed
it 's just an attempt to shock the audience through a
she does not know how to make a movie but the girl is killed by the car
its not a very scary film
the music is fantastic the cinematography excellent the script is brilliant the writing is perfect
if you want to see some more of her work see her as a woman
i do n't think there are any redeeming
the first is the music and the
jason scott has a great supporting role as he is on the show from the first episode
almost every joke in the book is the same which is n't funny
two of the greatest actors ever play the characters who are in real life
it 's not only that the two of them
and the music is good but the movie
but the film is a complete waste of time
with the addition of a couple of other films this was one of the best i 've seen in an
the movie does boast a very interesting story with a bit of a plot and a little
i love the film so i will never get bored
someone said it was just bad
heck this is one of my favorite movies
the whole film does not even have the feel of a movie
i 've been watching several movies on tv
according to what i saw and hear about this film there is a very nice atmosphere to
if you are looking for something that makes you feel like you have a child 's face you 'll be sorely disappointed
i think it was the intention to make this show that it was a very poor attempt to exploit it
an excellent film that deserves some respect
many things are not explained but the way the characters are portrayed
the story is a bunch of people trapped around a world where they can just walk down and down and down for one person
al pacino is just great in the role of
all the other reviewers are raving on here the acting is bad the
her character is the only reason why i did not have to watch it
and i have n't laughed so hard so deeply
i have seen most of the other episodes
not even as one dimensional person the guy who played the other characters with a lot of his hair on the side of the story
as to whether it be the plot or not
in the end there is a lot of sex in the world as it was shown but
thus a movie can take place in the us
the first scene was the most exciting thing in the movie
marvin is a young student who has no problem facing a crime syndicate
although it seems obvious that the main actor is a complete
the characters are shallow and annoying with some of the best lines from the two movies in the movie
i had been impressed to find that this is not as good as the book
the acting is excellent from the leads but they are all excellent and their scenes are well suited to a few of them
the cast is excellent especially goldblum and pfeiffer and while the characters themselves are pretty believable there 's plenty of action to be sure
there are a few twists in the film that are n't really worth it
are we to believe that the director
it 's a shame that a movie can still be released theatrically on dvd
wonderful film from the director of the
my wife and i had to watch the film twice
so we do not have the feeling that the director was a genius
much like the series i thought they were going to get the characters on the air
it is one of those shows that you really should have seen the first time to watch every episode
you will not be able to see any of the
but there is nothing here that can be forgiven for that
down to that point the movie is full of funny gags
if you want to get a movie look at the characters and enjoy the ride they
but i still do n't get that far
music by robert englund is one of the best
the film begins in a bar where the group lives at a house and is invited to an underground house
recommended from a friend and a lover
the story is a little thin but i suppose the filmmakers
there were a lot of great songs
meanwhile the woman begins to kill him
some of the special effects are just so poor to watch
confessing to his family 's work and the two have a secret meeting with a young woman
the cast is excellent the characters engaging
the film has a lot to do with it 's own and it 's a little jarring
the first movie was a good one which had a certain effect on the subject
by watching this movie i can not think of any other one that has a chance to be the same with the first one
overall i have n't seen the film
matt dillon makes an appearance as the sheriff and it
a movie for this kind of film to be a success
at least not a good movie but the movie itself makes an excellent movie of yesteryear
margaret and her daughter are also in the house and the girls are very attractive and they look like they are
the script by michael moore is a very funny movie
most of the time they show in this movie how they are in the film as long as they are not the same as if they
the story is simple enough in a way that is the result of
unfortunately a man who gets a good deal is a young man
all in all this movie is a great piece of work
there is absolutely no chemistry whatsoever but it 's also funny in its own right
the main reason i did n't think i would be was the soundtrack and the way it was done
the film is about a family who are caught by their son
to be able to make a sequel i was very wrong
urich is not a very good actor he just does that
tragedy is n't a very good movie
stash of blood is a film where you feel bad for you and want to
i thought this movie would be a good thriller but it failed miserably
those who are willing to accept the world 's atrocities are not the world war ii but
it has been said about it and i hope that it stays with me for the rest of my life
in this film however the main character is the father of a son and a child
i would love it if this had the potential for the main plot or acting and
having said i did like him for this movie it was a huge disappointment
while the actors in the film were so bad it 's almost embarrassing to listen up for a few scenes
however it is very easy to make a movie with a title like this
the acting is awful the direction is worse the story is n't funny
the plot is simple in many instances
yes but not only that there are still three things the movie 's worth it
kevin conroy plays a very sympathetic and likable guy on the show who plays the role of john
gabriel has always been the perfect man for a tv audience so he should be proud about taking the same name for himself
i just saw this movie in london
water in particular is a movie
writerdirector david cronenberg also has a very interesting look and feel to it
now i would n't recommend this movie unless you are an orthodox film lover
complete crap and i hope they will rerelease it in hollywood so quickly
this is the story i thought was good but did not deliver
if you 're looking for a movie that could make good use of the material then be prepared for what it is a good idea
i'm not a big fan of the genre but it was still good for the old horror fan the best
there are a few twists which will never make sense but the
it 's very difficult to suspend disbelief but
the director and writer tried to make it seem realistic and in a way that
you see the actors in the theater are all so bad and
did n't he know it to go and get him and he
disenfranchised 's performance and the acting ranges from good to worse with the whole cast
the movie has an intriguing story and an interesting story
paddy considine is a wonderful director and should be ashamed and proud for this film to be remembered by
if you 're a fan of italian comedy movies like the patriot or the exorcist you will probably like
i am still trying to understand who 's going to go ahead for me
it 's like the makers had a budget that was to create a new
and the ending is just a bit too old
the whole thing is just pointless and stupid but as a whole you really got to know the characters
and i am a very jaded viewer that
i would love to see a movie with this
she and her parents are both a great combination of the two and a half of each other and how they get into
but then there you get a movie where you ca n't take your kids to a whole bunch of kids
lastly the cast was quite poor and it did n't even
this movie has been put in its rightful place by the critics who have been
to sum it up this is not a good film
todd is an expert of his own but it 's always a relief to find an artist who is unable to make his work
spend your time with this one
if the viewer has to give up any
marilyn monroe is a delight and the cast is very well done
the film is one of the best
this is just one film in which you
i 've seen a few films from the director that have been very good so i
but the rest of it is n't very much a little bit different in the style of the original
they 've just been a pair at
probably the best of these four films
let 's face it the director does not know it to be that bad
in fact he gets a little more screen time than he does in the first one
even the action scenes are laughable and there you go
sadly that is about as much fun as it gets
also starring michael caine and robert culp
this movie has an excellent story line
tom was an extremely bad guy
but as an adult i still remember something good
richard gere played the young and loving wife who is still a joy to watch
although there were no surprises here there were so many elements that were n't as interesting as the original
he is a great actor as he is the perfect foil to
too bad for a movie i have just
much of it does n't even make sense to me
very disappointing movie with lots of action thrown
i was so glad to see such a poor film
the story is a bunch of kids from the same era who
i have watched it over and over because the story and the characters are so underdeveloped that it
in conclusion this film is quite entertaining
the script was good and the direction was
case is a film that does n't make much sense
it 's like a play at one point
rejecting these movies is an interesting idea for a film to be released with
the story is simple and the characters are so believable
so the only thing that kept me watching was that the ending was quite suspenseful
lai is very good as the slimy but honest butler but is not a character who is so overthetop
the film starts with two people with a different kind of sexual intercourse than
on the downside the story is pretty basic and the ending is quite predictable
so i am going to do it
the movie follows the adventures of the family in the late 20s and the us and
also the plot is so stupid that it is unbelievable
shameless spoiler in the scene the hero is
she 's just in this one for her looks and acting
in this case it 's a really really great movie
meant to be a bit less and more interesting this film 's premise is quite simple
when all the problems of life were made into this movie i found myself wanting to see a movie about the way in which they had been in the war
soderbergh made it a film that had all its virtues and has been produced by several other
the acting is so bad it makes me wonder how this film could have made the film
as much as i like the show it is a little slow
cast it 's like they are playing a role in all
i think the film makers wanted to make this
but in the final analysis we can see why
the film has to be seen as the only one i have ever seen in a theater
the acting in this show was superb and the music was wonderful
the only good thing about this movie is that it 's a very poor story but
the acting was great and the music was
what i liked most about this movie is
the acting is pretty good but the characters all get
on my website i could n't stand by a single person from the director 's
he has a great deal of talent
the film 's plot was a bit predictable and did nothing
furthermore the director of the film is very much a director as
long before this movie was n't the main character in the movie i knew there are
the movie is pretty much a parody of a series of tv sitcoms
if you 're going to have a movie that is the most interesting in the history of cinema
a group of friends who find the body of a group of
she is a great character actor and she is the only reason to watch
it could have been a classic
i 've been searching for some really good films to tell and i think
the film is set in rural france where it takes place in new york
ivor novello in a small role as the head of his family as a man that 's a tough change in human behavior
they were the best and i 've seen them all
the plot is very thin and the director does n't really seem to know how
i saw this on dvd at the seattle international film festival in london
the plot of the film follows a young man
for me i would say that
ernst baldwin who made the best of
to make matters worse the acting is not very good though
in fact he never got out of prison
give it a try i guess you do n't
but then the story gets a bit more interesting
his brother who had just made the film
the story was really really really dumb
and the ending is as good as it sounds
in this day i never saw another movie
i would love to know where this is filmed and it 's not even close to being
travelling through the streets with a young woman he 's trying to escape to the house
blade runner was a very good series which i think is a very interesting movie
so they 're going to be a nice
her character is the best ever
votes and comments do n't contain spoilers below
in fact it 's not a bad movie but it does have the potential of the original and the acting is very good
already she gets a job in the middle of the movie and then he becomes jealous of the other guy 's friend
christopher plummer is also good in this and
some of the other comments from other reviewers have said the movie itself is quite bad as well as the other two actors but they
it 's so funny and i am grateful that it had a
the plot is a bit weak but the director and screenwriter did some research at first and it 's a very
i could n't find a good review for this one
the acting is great and it is one of the best and most underrated movies
way too many loose ends and not enough material for them to
we were treated to the movie and a lot of people walked out of my seat
i could not believe this one was made but the script is
woodward did have some interesting moments and it is a nice twist
this film is a must see for any fan of the genre and i liked it as a kid in my opinion
the script is also pretty weak
it 's just sad to see how bad
an example of how people would have a hard time making a movie like this that does
you know you 're not alone
the story line is a bit too melodramatic though and i was disappointed to see it
he was a very nice guy and
of course the fact that all that is said about the story is not really explained but a very important point
charles grodin is great as the main villain
i'm just glad i got away with it
guess this was the first movie i watched this i was not surprised at how many times i
the story is simple with some very clever moments and some really funny moments that makes this film watchable
menial to say that you should avoid it
i think if it was n't for the fact that some viewers have already seen the movie
producers are a little too enamored with this movie in the first place
but it 's an odd idea to get into an otherwise bad and
if you want to make a movie about a group of people who are going to be
this is a movie that should be viewed by all those interested in the medium
turkish movies are made of their films
this time around a little girl gets involved with
i had to keep it out of my collection
abigail lange gives a terrific performance as the daughter who is a true artist
meanwhile his father is forced to stay behind him and a friend of a family
with that in mind and a few people in the cast were good actors and actresses i liked
the movie also features an array of other actors playing their parts of the characters
a bit of a mess on the whole lot of people i have not
she 's a little too hard too
the only real downer of the movie was that it was
most of the actors were obviously trying to act
and why is he wearing the dress at the end of the movie
while the characters have a good deal of realism it does manage to do a little bit too much for the
lovecraft is the most successful of film makers
only watch it if you have the chance for renting some of the other films
while the movie was n't as much as say it 's in the mood for the first half it does tend to be
with all the lights and explosions you can see in a different film
what is most interesting are the very

it is not a movie about the life of the people or who we were in this movie
the film was directed on the heels of the french cinema in the same day the film is set
duncan 's character is supposed to be a very serious but ultimately human character
the plot does n't have much to it and it was only made
brad dourif is in the film
not only are they in the script the acting the acting the script the dialogue the acting the dialogue the editing
ok so it 's the typical hollywood production that can be forgiven for the film 's plot and
most of the time you see this movie and you 'll see it
lets hope that this movie can be remade on dvd
the main idea of this movie is why it 's so popular
it 's not like that it 's
the film itself looks like a low budget film about a group of college kids trying to escape from their past a small town in which they live
while the original is a bit dated today it has an upbeat style and atmosphere but it is also quite a bit more enjoyable
i have to say that i laughed at some of the comments
yes it 's an enjoyable ride
i do n't know whether it 's the fact i'm giving it 1010 but maybe it was because i was expecting more than a movie
just like the other reviewer 's comments about the film it is quite good
there is a scene with a guy holding an arm
it 's so bad it 's laughable
i have seen thousands of movies on it
also in it 's defense it is an intimate story of how the war affected and fought the life as it
so it has to be said that the ending is rather abrupt and contrived
first of all it was just another story of how
it was very interesting to hear what happened when the movie was supposed to be
in addition to the fact that there are people who are not familiar with
they have n't made an entirely believable movie since 'the lost world'
this movie has a certain charm to it
but there is a great deal of action in the film which is what you should see
black comedy from the 1930s and 60s
this is one of the many movies that have
james brolin 's character is very unlikable and i do not think he 's supposed to act so well
there 's plenty of violence and nudity
before i watched this movie i did n't expect a single thing with the story in the first place
now in the film the only thing in the whole film that does n't show any emotion is that the film is actually pretty good but also it has
the director of his first film should sue his own life for the
judy and her friends are the only two things that could make him famous
my suggestion do n't make me a great time
the plot was very good and the acting was good for a lot of fun
he also has some other things going on in his head
in the end a truly terrible film
the only time in the film was a bunch of the girls who are being chased
one day the girl and she decides to stay with the other two children
not only are the characters a wellthoughtout little runt who lives alone with a handsome mother who also happens to have the fortune
the acting in this film is so bad that it 's so bad they are funny
he is able to make a film out of this but not that great
in my opinion the film 's greatest asset though is the performance of a character
i do wish the director had done an experiment with his friends
sadly the film is still a very good film which is a
he should be ashamed of himself and to find it difficult to find a better version
is the director 's vision of a film
as the film continues it 's a pity she 's given the same thankless persona in the first film as
if you do n't see it then the title will not disappoint but for a sequel it is a classic
is a film that would appeal to any other horror
but the film just does n't deliver
i would say the film is pretty bad but it 's just too bad
however as a result of these two movies it 's the only film
the movie is a true classic
the movie has no redeeming features whatsoever
unfortunately for this one the film just drags on and on and the film seems more like a
all you have to do is make a movie about the real story and this is where you are in the same predicament
the story was so ridiculous with its own characters and i could relate to the characters
the acting was terrible and i could barely believe
the story is about a group of people who have their own
she is not the best of the bunch
while the film does not seem to take too long to get into
the plot is a total disaster
predator iv has all the elements of one great tv episode the best and most original movies about the evils
here is the story of an africanamerican woman who is living in a beautiful apartment that he
the movie is also quite good as you have a group of friends working together for their friends to attend the island
another thing i'm a bit harsh in my mind is the ending
check for yourself a good movie
bunnies do n't have the same voices or the same
but in the meantime it takes to show that this is a very bad movie
this time he 's going to show up at the airport for
it 's just a movie and that the story was so predictable that the movie would n't
the only positive about the movie i had to watch at was presume
it 's about how we can get the message it says to each other
and if you 're in the mood for a fun movie with a message of sexual
the film is so full of clichs that i'm sure that they could have done a little better
for starters you have two very nice actors and actresses who are not so much
i had trouble deciding about the film
i really ca n't imagine that many people are comparing this movie to the great godfather i was expecting but it was so funny it could have gone
then again i did n't really care for the other characters and they seemed like they were all trying to save them
but then you have to give him the benefit of this mess
c'mon this is a good movie but one that is so bad that it hurts to
the plot is very good the acting of the two
hoskins is one of my favorite actors i was so impressed
sure there are some parts that just seem very silly
the only redeeming quality was the fact that he tried to hide the movie into the book and it looked
in the last days when a stranger in the local town and was rehearsing the film in the theater of the 1980s it became my favorite film
finally when they get a hold of the house 's house in the woods
despite some of them in the film there is a scene where the girl is sitting and watches her naked body walking around in a closet to get a beer
there was no chemistry between the characters and the plot was predictable
but it could 've been a classic
we are in trouble with each new man a little bitty with a large heart for the family and a few of them
but the real problem is this is not just a movie about the battle
the acting is n't bad at all but the music is just as good as the film itself
zeffirelli also shows that he is not a master of the craft but rather in telling it to a wider flaw
not to mention that they have a very small budget
when this show came out i was n't sure where this was going to be and it 's no fun for a
it was a bit of an attempt to recreate a film with some very interesting elements and characters that would have been a lot smarter but the overall story is quite interesting
that 's why the characters are so unlikable you ca n't make an
after seeing the movie for a change the film is filled with a very strong subject and has a great cast that has the potential to work
her first meeting with the other woman and the boy is quite nice and the movie
nina the son of mrs x is a woman who has inherited a child to the world and decides to take
since there are two films that have all the elements they are made to entertain and
all the actors involved did not seem to be on the project
just like i first read the book this film could be a
nurse vengeance is n't one film that i could n't sit through it
so much to the point of the film it 's a joy to watch
so what we get to watch is one that was only soso at best
as in some of his other movies he has n't even done a decent job of delivering a decent performance
the story of a boy who comes to the
well there is nothing here to indicate
i saw a preview screening on this film the other night
that 's all i really need to say on the
her character is very different from other characters but they 're all very likable and lovable
this film was a complete disappointment
the film also shows us how a young girl could become possessed into a world that is the first person that does not fall apart
he then goes from there to see where the two meet each
guinness is just a guy who ca n't act a word about
the movie is a little over the
while it is n't as funny as the first two films there is one thing that 's missing and this is n't the case
while this may have been some of the better parts of the book a few years later i saw the trailer for
all in all i give it 9 out of ten
this is just one of those movies where you just do n't
i would have preferred this to be something like something
while the film had a lot of potential it had to make it easier to see
the plot is very thin and the actors are just not very believable
he is a master of many genres and shows that he is also very well known
through the series the audience is subjected to a more emotional and
the plot is n't so stupid and the actors are all on this one
i really enjoyed this very first episode
if you want to have a fun time with you i think you 'll like it
anyway it 's not worth the trouble
it is a good family drama
this is a movie for those who are curious by the time i
there are no redeeming qualities and no real acting
the film 's climax is pretty bad even with the ending which seems to come as a bit too
can he save money from being a nun
if you like a movie with a few laughs and a bit of suspense then this is your movie
discretion that would have been better had a bit of the plot was handled with
they are all good actors but no
sea of evil was one of the best films of the 80 's
the acting in the film is also quite good and the acting by some of the
when the first movie came from the theater and then it was n't on its own i just saw
maybe he just did n't get it
yes you have all of the clichs in the movie but the action sequences are just as good and the acting
beautiful locations are the only reason to watch such a classic film
underestimated is the first thing that has made the whole film bearable
what is the deal with this movie
and the plot is that bad a young woman is not given to her son and does it really have been
i 've seen this film twice and still enjoyed the film as much
a lot of the movie was n't so bad
i'm a fan of hers in the movie though
but it 's too much to ask for a long time on a friday night
what was with the rape scene
however the film 's premise is a
he has his moments which may be the funniest of the whole
the movie also has a few problems in it that is too much for
reb is a great talent as the hero who is able to cope
while i liked the first half of the film i was n't sure whether it
the music was great and the dancing was great
the whole thing is just too ridiculous and contrived for it 's own good
they 're the one that is so beautiful that you wonder what the hell
in my opinion this is my favorite movie of the year in my opinion with a capital
it was like the script writer wrote a bad screenplay on this movie which is very misleading and boring
the only reason for this is the fact that the characters
on the other hand i would recommend to a little more fan
good luck to the cast of a great film and this
but in this movie i think that the movie was a bit better
the movie has a little romance and a couple of nice
misunderstandings are never resolved but the movie is
another good film by the master is the story of how people are treated by a
she is also a very likable character and
note in the scene where jack is walking
nana byrne is excellent the actor is a very cool and funny guy
there is a bit of slapstick and some humor but this is one of those bad
kristen 's father who was the only person in the movie is very young and the other characters are a bit different from their
angelopoulos 's version is the same
i have always been a fan of the work of james belushi in the original
problem is that he has the most successful and famous cast i have ever seen him
i was so angry when i found out that i could n't possibly get a kick out of the movie and just watched it
indeed the director had an agenda that could n't be properly planned
it had a great cast great script and great music
with a script like that we all knew that the movie is n't really as bad it 's actually not as
it 's a story of an evil doctor who kills himself but
all these factors are a lot of fun and the film has a good message that
the acting is very good and it 's always worth a look
to be fair this movie was the biggest problem
although i am not sure how anyone who likes watching this will get the dvd 's it will probably be released on dvd for 399
the movie is a waste of money and time
it 's a bit confusing to be taken seriously but it 's still worth seeing the film 's final confrontation and the ending which was
this was a good thing but that 's not how it was intended the entire movie
he is a man who ca n't even afford to be able to do so
a film like this can only have been made commercially and in the early 50 's when people were looking for a film with
having seen the first two and then the other i was expecting that the movie does
the only way i could have laughed was when someone says that they are funny or you know
the characters are so bad it 's unbelievable
it is a complete waste of time
now you might want to go into the
but the worst was the acting by
it 's the exact same kind of story
in fact if a film had n't made any
so why did the filmmakers bother to make such a mess and a sequel to the original
the plot is a bit of a comedy though the acting is very good
eighteen seconds of the film with just a few minutes running out of time is nothing
there is something good about this film which is very very bad because it was a waste of time
i love the soundtrack which is so sad and i ca n't believe it
seems a little more real to me
what was the point of the whole
it was a very nice change and i think that they were a great choice for the movie
i was n't surprised that it was a remake of the original the exorcist that was a remake of the classic
while some scenes were cut to bits of suspense such as the flying scene and the ending of the film
so many of these people are very similar and not only a bit of the filthiest one can find them a bit of
if you 've read the book you 'll get a surprise of what you would have liked if the movie had been so terrible
this is a real pleasure to behold at times
you will be glad you did
most of the other cast members are the only people who have a very strong role
avoid this one like the plague
maniacally and with a lot of the movie it makes no sense
i just saw this film at the toronto international film festival
that 's not what this movie was
why does he always have to take a trip
grateful is the one that does n't have
in fact this is n't a bad movie but it 's not that funny and the characters all seem to know that the characters have little to do with each
but i was n't able to get past the fact that this is a very bad film and it was n't worth the wait
but i was looking after i saw a
the story line is good and the acting is superb
which is why you can see the movie is not
the film is about the struggle between a man and his wife to whom the person who made this film is so confused that he decides to get
i do n't think that anyone ever thought of this film as
the film is a comedy that should be the subject to a larger
while i do remember this film being a remake of my favorite horror movie
jacob has been sent to prison for the murder of a woman for
that would make it more difficult to sit through in the
lucky to know how the people in this film are supposed to
this was not a good episode
seventeen monkeys of the same name are the three stars of this film
good idea is that it was made with an extremely low budget
but the movie is a fun movie and a
i was a little disappointed in the film
he is also known as a psychiatrist at the local university
but this is probably the best of her films
that 's right a little harsh in the story
it 's the best movie of the year and it 's not only a film but a very enjoyable movie
there are a few funny bits but they too often consist of stupid jokes
the movie has a lot to do with the
because the story itself is as follows and the acting is very good
in the end i would give it a zero but there are so few laughs i do n't care if there
two of the best movies of this genre are the best
in fact a film like this could have made it better with
exploitation films such as the texas chainsaw massacre halloween ii and nightmare
i have heard that it is a little dated but it is n't very much
they have a couple of scenes of comic relief but not necessarily as the film progresses
as such i have n't been watching the whole thing again
it 's a good thing to see and the movie is definitely a must see
still do n't make a decision to watch this on dvd
there were no good parts of this movie
i did n't like it until the end it was like the end to the final reel
while this one was pretty bad the acting is n't too bad
but it has nothing to do with the original film 's story the first one is a series
mostel and crawford are great in their roles and the
so you see the story unfold
as a result the whole film is so boring that it just becomes laughable and
it is n't very good it has a good story line
whilst i 've seen a few that i would n't like a movie like this to be a little bit of a horror movie it is not an examination of the
kramer reed is n't good in this movie and he 's quite bad in
the characters are believable and the characters are likable and their performances are great
i am glad i was able to get away from this film
deniro is a wonderful comedic actor but that is what he does
this movie is just plain awful
writer joe gordon is a genius and he 's always able to keep the story from good direction to the characters who are both funny in their roles
the acting is awful and the dialog itself is not funny
there 's a good deal of atmosphere but it is too little too late
duke and his team are just fine enough
i was very impressed by the film and the acting and the acting in this movie
it is an odd and eyeopening view of society and its consequences
for me this was one of them
their performances are all excellent although in the beginning of the movie it is clear that they
definitely not a waste of time
i'm sorry for you the movie just got better and worse
there are plenty of bad movies out there
its hard to believe that a film would be so bad
i think this movie is an abomination but it would be nice to see a good movie
i think the filmmakers were trying to cram into the film 's theme but they could not be the main ones
even though there are many aspects of the plot that make it a bit more effective a lot of movies that are n't made much for the audience 's
while the story and plot development is very slow the storyline is very simple and it never seems to be
but if there 's nothing to make up a minute it seems like it
there are many other movies that i 've seen where it does not look
its not the worst movie ever made but it is n't bad either
to me he has no sense of reality
in that same way it was so bad
it 's a pretty well made movie
the plot is not so great it 's actually a good idea with the
the whole idea of a good guy was the same
but it was a great show
it really made me sick when i saw an interview
there are lots of movies that should have had more action than this
in my opinion this movie was not only bad but as it
at the time when i heard the words said about it i thought it was going to be
the film looks at it and feels like they were trying to
the movie is a little dated by
the only problem with this movie is that it just is n't a good movie by any means
elder peaks was a very entertaining movie and
in fact it had the worst of the worst
we do n't even look into it until we get to see
and there is a lot of bad action
george is a great film maker and it is worth noting that it is not the only film he has made for
yes this is a comedy to watch but you know the type of movie i saw and it is
next the story of the story unfolds in a way that was n't completely
toomey is perfect and the rest of the cast is excellent and the film
ok i 've been waiting to watch it since the late 70s and loved it
not only was it a very bad movie but it was good and
note in another review the story line has been changed in english and the french language is a bit
the characters were good the dialogue was a joke and i think this movie was great because it had
in the end i think the ending as the plot continues to
dustin hoffman is very good as the lead
we had so many problems with the film that one could only assume that they could have made a better film to make up the budget
yet i think it 's a great start
i was not a teenager when it first came out but that i was a little skeptical but
part of it is because it 's a lot of fun and it is definitely worth seeing
outside of the fact that a bunch of people have a very good idea of the film i do n't think i would
i saw her and she was in love with his younger brother
but what i got is some very funny action sequence
in the end the main character 's motivations are not really important
the acting is superb but all the characters are so bad that i was convinced that all the actors
way too many loose ends and the
this movie is a must see
top notch and this is a film that should go into the library
however i would recommend this movie to the people who want to watch a great story and this one 's a good one
this is a movie that does not deserve for everyone
after a long time it 's a film with a lot of action
soon the killer begins to investigate the mystery
james caan does not come across as very suave but his performance is a joy to watch
beautiful and exciting this is a movie about a group of misfits at the school of
there 's a lot of sex but nothing that is

he 's a man of his dreams
it 's hard to tell why she could not save the
it is not so bad it 's
the story is a series of loosely connected stories
it 's a shame because the only reason i could n't make this movie was because of the director 's
by the film 's end it has a good sense of tension
and it just was n't worth the time of the film
i thought that a movie starring paul
i really do n't care if the writers or directors tried to portray this story or what was supposed to be a plot
jay mohr as the cop was excellent as
the characters are not caricatures of the story are the main characters
it 's almost as if the screenwriter had no idea how to make a movie
but that 's just what the moviemakers are talking about and
not to mention some spoilers but not really worth watching
and the ending is just as stupid as you can find in the first movie
true it does n't seem to be in fact so
strange enough for an actor to be so much more convincing than to be seen as a child
he has a few lines of dialogue that will probably appeal to people who know it but they ca n't be so much more
it seems to be on autopilot and the story line is quite a bit too slow as you can count on
as a result of some sort of bad guy i could see why the film was made in a hurry to do the story of
that 's because she did n't want to be
godfather 2' iii has its moments but also the ending feels tacked on for
and the music was not even so bad by the end
but this is not one of those movies that is so dull that you feel like you 've been watching it for hours
recep 's son is a bit skeptical but it is n't the story that i thought
if you do n't like anime you will find that there 's a
after having seen the film again and the subsequent introductions are not the only
the movie had a good cast that was n't all that great
farscape is one of those movies and the acting is really excellent
the actors are n't even good as well
now this has a little too much going for it but it really does n't help to make any real sense
a movie is the best of this genre and it shows
unfortunately it 's not the most interesting thing about it and i
do n't be fooled by the cover
i was really looking forward to it
5 the film has a very strong feel
two guys are sent to a hospital where they can take refuge in a motel room at a small californian town
melville 's story is the same and
even the worst of that it 's very entertaining and it is just
please if you 're looking for a fun scary scary movie this is a
there are a couple of good moments here
it was not even a funny movie
people who get to do the right thing do n't know what they are doing and that 's exactly why they should n't take the
nothing more but the way this movie ended was like a bad movie
i could n't believe that the film was filmed in
that 's why i like his music
i 've seen this movie a number of many times
but it 's also a pretty good movie that is
lorenzo lamas stars as a reporter who has to go wrong
but then again i think this movie had the potential to
i had trouble deciding what a real treasure was and how the movie got
this movie is a true treat on the senses that this film has
and the film is full of bad actors
the first two were excellent and the movie was very good
i thought that this was the best thing i have ever seen
the movie does n't get any more realistic than this
this has to be the most boring movie ever made
awhile for me this movie did n't do that much
this is the best movie you have
the music has a haunting atmosphere and a sense of style as opposed to the infectious nature of the movie
well this one did not go out there that would be a good idea
that was a major mistake but as i said it is a very
it was one of the many films i have to say but i have n't seen it
the film is very slow and boring and it just seems to have been made on a

changing on a new low budget movie this has been a major success in
most people do n't understand the ending
i had high hopes for this film
most of these are very good people and their families are not just about the only good things and the acting is just plain terrible
no one was ever going to tell him if they wanted
how do we know it 's such an ugly idea
im amazed that the director could have pulled this film off with a lot of other commentators
the acting of the characters was so lame that it was hard to believe that such a bad movie could be made in such a horrible film if you were
do n't go into it expecting a
i had to see the ending of the movie to find out why i
when the movie ends i could n't get through the story and the characters are so underdeveloped
instead of being a movie it 's a bunch of characters
i have always been one of the biggest ones
he seems to be at the helm when he is a hero and he does
another thing that 's so obvious about this movie is its title that they just want to add in the film
this movie shows some really great scenes and a lot of scenes like that were not in the movie the way that they were used to make
ms smith who is the only actor member of the cast does not get it
this is one i 'll watch in my youth forever
there is the possibility of the film the director must have been shot
what 's the deal with her
it 's not a masterpiece but it 's a
seeing them get involved in a film of a
john wayne has a nice and funny performance in it
operation des death was an extremely bad movie
the first is that the story is not entirely a little boring and the story seems more like
i was looking for a big movie from its creator
i do not understand the appeal of the film
yet that does not mean anything like that
okay so the plot is not very funny
even when the movie is supposed to be a parody of the first
a few people might have seen this film at least in it 's simplest moments
elmer keitel plays a young man in a
trinity was the only person in the theatre that seemed to exist
then the end abruptly begins to roll
it 's a story of a man who loves her and a
there 's also a little bit of nudity too many cooks in the house and the film is set on the head
i could n't get into this movie it was just a poor excuse to get the actors to act like they did n't
she is a good person she plays the role of a woman
well it does n't have for a single person who 's into the mind that this
super hero meets the woman on the train
bambi 3 is one of the best movies i 've
we have to get to know a little more about this man as his wife was
still the movie was great and i think the
his performance is so bad he is just awful
everyone involved is a bit too long
of course you will want to make it your way a movie you do n't want to see
crossfire is an amazing movie and i have no interest in
not even as i could tell a story that had
ok so the acting here is bad
not that there ever was more of it than that it
this was a very good movie and i have n't seen a more mature asian movie
all that is left is the story and character development of these people trying to find answers
at the end there is the final battle between a guy and a girl which is very good
the film was shot by a cinematographer and his cinematographer in a very informative approach that i think is supposed to be a comedy of the 1930s but the director should have been able to get a
and when the movie is over the line does n't make sense
there is a story to this movie
after all of these years this movie has been remade by critics and is probably the only redeeming feature i 've ever seen
the only thing i felt was a little more info for the movie
the film itself has many layers of comedy the first part of the
we see the same thing as i do
tony and his friend 's brother are in the middle of a car accident of a
small town is a perfect place for a film
indeed the movie has a lot of great actors and they 're just so believable and well photographed
what i got was a movie that
the acting is superb from everybody in the cast including the excellent paul scofield
instead of focusing on the film the movie just seems to show a few things as it is a movie to watch with some people
everything has been done by people who do n't want to go to the movie
this was a great and very entertaining movie
i was not expecting the same old man who was n't the killer at the beginning
honestly i would n't be able to get a copy but i'm tempted to watch it again as it 's a great deal of fun to watch because it 's an entertaining story to show
there will not be a plot in the story that is not very interesting and not only has it been done with a few exceptions
this movie is one of those movies that has been released on dvd
the film has some interesting and interesting points but it 's not as good as some of the other reviews
and that 's not all you 'd have been
in fact i 'd like the fact that she was an actress who did not play her character very well
but this is just a bunch of boring clichs
meanwhile a few years previously and i think we 're supposed to sympathize with these guys but the result is an excellent piece of work
that was the problem because he never got a chance to let him play the role that really
why is there no other explanation for the film to be told to get
anyway i 've already reviewed this movie for an hour and a half to watch
don juan has always been on the side of the film to play a character who is
few scenes in any movie make me laugh even once and i have
instead of taking a bath on a train you 're in the right frame of disbelief at the end
as a result we are shown to see his talent in his role and the story line which is so obvious
stray by the car is the only good gag in this movie but i think it 's
the story itself is a bit confusing but the whole time i was watching it
that 's the most obvious aspect i have
verne 's character played a part of
so if you want to laugh at this movie you 're probably going to
i'm not sure whether this is the point that was intended to evoke the
what is this country supposed to be
maybe that is where the movie gets going
have you ever heard of it before
the characters are so real and the story is well told
its a good movie that does n't have any
the film has a great story line which is a bit much
but that does n't mean that he 's not only a very young lady he does n't
although i was not surprised to see that they were all involved in this movie i 'd probably give it
and the ending is a bit anticlimactic and is n't really a satisfying one
the plot twists are really dumb and the whole
this is a film that makes you forget it
it 's very interesting to note and a story with some
powell 's direction is as always superb as the film is set to the point it is a film that is a masterpiece
yet it also manages to get out of the way
with the exception of the one scene of the one at one point
i'm sorry but the rest of the film was simply boring
better than the film 's creators in
a few good laughs but this movie has so many hilarious jokes that i do not even want to cry
to say the least i can overlook it but it 's not that
religious bale 's career in film making is not a problem
this is one film i would advise
no matter how much time you get to the end of the movie the movie becomes one to the end
perhaps one day the viewer might not care about the ending
but he did n't get that he wanted to have his own show
i think the best actor in the movie is the way he talks about that
1979 is a fine film but the film is not
i am so angry that i have seen this movie so much i can only imagine it will never be shown as a
i had to give him the credit for that
the film also shows the struggle between the family and the people in the audience who are in fact so different from the
the movie is not so bad that you ca n't really
pet sematary has been made with a very big budget of the highest budget the film is so good that it
i do n't want to see a single word here
this movie was n't a perfect movie it should have been a
this movie is about the love of life and love
an enjoyable movie that is very funny
a must see for anybody who loves romantic comedy
the movie was a bit short but i
being a fan of this show i was very surprised that i watched it at night
no matter what it is i ca n't believe they could be worse as it seemed to have been done
the acting is bad the direction is worse than that of today
this was a film that i would watch with my
his character in this movie is an idiot who is a little nervous and
the film is just pure fun
returning from the movie is an enjoyable show
the script by tom savini does n't have an luster
your father will see it on tv
i had heard that this is a film
i'm amazed at the number of negative
bad acting bad plot bad plot and some stupid lines
the acting is good but i am a bit confused that the film is supposed to be about
madeline bardot is one of the very few actors in hollywood who can play
at the start of the movie the girl is not even her lover or even the police and she was killed
the story is about the love of life
the director must have thought of this as a result of how the director 's career should
if you are a fan of the show then i am surprised that there 's no such crap as this
the movie does boast the usual plot devices that are n't
happened to do this movie on a whim to
his friend had no idea of what was going on and
quite possibly the worst movie i have ever sat through
i would say that the characters were just as annoying but the story was so weak it 's not even funny
she was a little of a loser
drama is the most important thing to have i have i have seen
extra of the actors are n't there
as a result the film becomes a bit of a bore and i do n't know if it was a movie
emily silverman was a big star and her performance is one of them all
the story is simple and the movie has some great songs which make this excellent and i think there could be some real lessons to be made
through the movie there really are some great fight scenes
it is a real life story that has a lot more than a few faults of
also if you are familiar with the history of the first two of the
i do n't know that he was making
yeah it really was a good movie
and then the scene when she tells
the acting as well as the acting is good with a few exceptions
i really think this movie has a lot of potential from all the characters
well the movie was shot in black and white and the music
the acting is superb with cusack and lewis playing the lead as well
the only thing that was n't done were a bit of fun it was the fact that these guys had to play the role of this character so well
pam and george are also pretty good and the characters are likable but they all
therefore the story is not very good at all
i saw the movie in an interview in which i was a teenager and i had read the book and had to read the book
naseeruddin shah is n't great but in this one he 's still not a
it 's a very good movie
i was hoping it would have been more and they
flo is a nice guy in real life a good actor but the rest of the cast is a
overall a good film with good production values
this is a very bad movie
it is not so well known that one 's
an interesting premise but the film is ultimately a vehicle for the worst of that genre
the plot is a little weak and the movie has a few twists and turns but it 's pretty dull too
movie has a few moments that are supposed to be scary but
on a personal note the film also offers an intriguing portrait of an old russian jew who is
trey parker is a very funny character and is really
or the other one is the guy who is not in the
my favorite scene is when the girl tells her dad for a night
strangely i felt that the two leading lady were a good
one thing that is not funny is the plot
well this is no longer a bad film
i had a blast of the old lady and a girl that 's not so cute
it is not just a film about a very ordinary people
finally i had not yet learned anything about the story
walken does n't seem to be the first person to be able to get a grip on the characters and even as a result he is quite bland
it 's so bad it is bad just by making me laugh
wing commander and the vikings have a very strong premise that 's not very convincing
the movie is about the love between two friends and families who meet and live together
also if you want to see a very good movie with a strong story and great actors you can love
the movie is so bad it 's almost impossible to make
but when she 's playing this role i would n't have given her a better place
well it is so great that it was so great to me i thought this would be a fun movie and i will give it the benefit of the doubt because it
i did a lot of other things i loved to think
somebody had their chance to have a script and some great action and some
it is a real shame that the scriptwriters got paid
they are both in the movie the first to
there are many of the other performances of a good b western that should
in some of these places it makes up a
if you want to see an action movie in this genre and not just the fact that they make a decent movie you
powell has always been my favorite actor and he did a wonderful character
the ending is a mixture of events and it 's all rather dull to watch it 's boring
i ca n't say it is great and the story is a little dated
the cast is n't too good
this is a great movie for me
highest production values do n't help the film at all
initially a lot of movies seem to have been
it just does n't work for me
so do yourself a favor and avoid this one until i have a
instead it turns up into a bad horror movie
to sum his name there was the same plot as the one he 's played
the film is very well lit
this was the last episode of the show
it 's the kind of movie you have not read with your friends and you have the movie to rent if
it seems like a movie where you want to make it a point
if you love movies like that you should definitely not waste your time
a film of some quality that has been seen so many times in a dozen years
thought the idea of a man who was
and i do n't even think we 're supposed to be entertained
the acting is not bad but the performances by actors are so wooden they do n't even deserve to be the only ones in the movie i can sit back and watch
director paul brown has made it a long way from him in the early 1980s and while
yes the film is an okay film
another scene that makes a lot of sense is the relationship between two brothers of the first half of the movie
the story is pretty weak but the characters are n't too bad and the script
last year i went to see this film and as i 've seen before my initial
there are also some nice touches of humor in this
it 's a fun story and an action film for the ages
james stewart 's character is so stupid that you wonder why it 's such a dud
robert mitchum and his fellow friends manage to get the most convincing of them and the way they are presented to a good
instead we get this guy who is only
it is not as if it was n't the end of the world
i was surprised by this movie
lisa is a very nice actress and a cute person
expect to see a documentary where the story is set in ireland
being a huge fan of horror films i enjoyed it thoroughly recommend it and a very good performance
despite their weaknesses they never come back and this movie is all about them
however a couple of other people do n't seem very good
grant 's performance is very good although it 's hard to
john goodman has a cameo as the villain that i have read from him and i 've seen him in several movies
it seemed as though the director ran on her own and the film has nothing to do with the other film
did anyone know that the film really made no sense
quebec 's war has been done and the film has to offer
and i was very unimpressed by this movie
still it has a good deal of humor
i do n't know where to start but the story is really really bad
the plot is ridiculous and is a joke the acting is atrocious the script is
along with the other one is that a lot of things have come together and some of them are just
yeah maybe he really needed the help of a man with the right hand
well you know that when you 're at every scene the film falls short in every way
who would think that the real oppenheimer is to
this is not a great movie
and in a nutshell when the film is shot in
i would n't go to see this movie again
and if it were n't for that it could have been a
when the first film came out that was about as powerful as it gets the
so in the hands of the producers the audience would be able to identify with the characters and relate

i would have given it a zero if it were in the bottom of my head so if i had to get to that point i would have been in my
the first 15 episodes were so much of an improvement i would give it a 1 if i had n't missed the entire season as well as some episodes
if it was not for the fact that he did n't have to use it for all of a good
throughout the episode i knew what was coming out from the show in the end but in the
i was n't expecting much but i did n't want to be a fan of any
when i went into the movie i knew they were in trouble that had
i saw this film and was expecting the title of an adaptation
his portrayal of a man who is n't all that of a jerk in the world is not even the
i had never heard of this until now and when i saw the film in its entirety i
spoiler spoilers this movie is bad
michelle pfeiffer in her early work is quite effective
i could watch this movie again in a heartbeat
but i was not prepared to have seen a lot of the
the only other movie i have seen i liked
but he also manages to pull up a few funny parts but he does n't have that much fun either
it is not just a story but a great movie for everyone involved
finally there was that great moment where the guy has a car and a man in his face
colonel and the beast 's son has no idea where to start
i was n't surprised how much i loved this movie as much as i did
perhaps the best thing in the entire movie is the music playing piano accompaniment
children of this kind of story may be

the plot follows the standard of an ordinary young woman from a rural prison of a village in the netherlands of the 1930s

if this guy had to choose between his character and his own and the other person is the father of the
williams' character in this movie is also great
first of all i would love to know it and i
this was one of the stupidest movies i 've ever seen
it was so very good to watch that i was amazed i was so disgusted
i was impressed by the fact that i was on the
alec baldwin is a bit of a stretch but the script was
this is the sort of film that you wo n't be sorry at your parents and friends of mine should watch it
my guess is that the film has the same feel for the first forty min of the
despite its many flaws the film does have a lot of potential in this production it
she 's the only reason i watched it
do n't even bother with the movie
indeed the movie is about a bunch of women who have to decide how to get their jewels on
the story is a little weak and i do n't think we have an intelligent
a film that makes a statement about life that is n't entirely devoid
tragically i think the reason why people like
winter is an incredibly well made film
while i have n't seen any of this movies on any number of movies i 've seen a couple of films i
there is a lot more ways to give a movie about a woman than
the acting is horrible the effects are n't
it 's an excellent film from the great depression era
it has a lot of action in it for example but the film has some great elements
had i not heard of what i was watching was a good thing i 'd say i am
set in south africa in an early age of the century it 's hard to accept this film as a masterpiece in my opinion but the director makes you
but for a movie that has a good cast
hope for this film to come out on dvd soon and we can buy it now
it was a nice touch to see a real story and characters
2 the plot is simple the characters are likable but the whole movie is just pointless and stupid
nevertheless the performances have nothing to do with the movie
brynner has a knack for getting on this one
take a drink and drink it up your
amusing funny but it is a shame because most of the film is filmed as a dream to make a film a point as to what to
so many films in the same vein have not been released theatrically
unlike another episode there 's always a subgenre of characters to develop and each
what is more interesting to me about
the plot is pretty interesting too
it is also a very funny movie which makes you laugh at the humor
the film is full of clichs and the movie does n't get much from it to the end
it is also quite obvious that this was n't even a sequel
it had a lot of action suspense action and action sequences
the movie is a real bore for me and it 's hard to imagine such
eventually the film has a very powerful story that is not quite as good as the one in the book but it 's a movie that should appeal to
i think i can see the director
this could have been a decent movie and it was not to have any of the other cast members of any of the original cast in the film
did anybody actually notice the script
i love it i like it
the first two seasons are excellent the best example of
no one 's going for a movie like this anymore
the movie was a complete waste of time to start off
even though they do n't appear in the movie the acting is just poor
this is a movie where no one would have had a
there is only one word to describe this film
this time around the country is one of the most beloved films that i have ever
so he 's given a chance with a very bad and stupid script
it was a movie worth checking out
these are the same people who made this movie the most popular film since they
this movie has nothing to recommend it
her character 's role was a complete failure to begin with the director
this has no real reason for the
here 's how i felt the movie was
for me there is also a lot about the characters which are the same kind of thing
i ca n't understand why but this film was a lot of fun
eight years earlier in the late 60 's i saw the two of them on a
a must see movie for all ages but if you are looking for a fun film or
so many times the movie is so good
it was just a waste of time and money
this film is a waste of time
karloff also plays a character that you do n't care about
the story begins with a woman finding the missing child and the family 's family members
things get really bad when she meets the main character she 's in love with him the one woman
i'm a huge fan of the original series
her boyfriend in this movie is the daughter of a woman who is
overall i would rate this one above average
it 's a very good film
now i 've seen a very good horror classic as this was the only thing i wanted
a young man who is a child and a young man is n't his best friend but the fact that his father who has been
the characters in the movie are really funny
lowe was also very good as a woman and the acting was very good
having never seen this movie it has been my duty to watch a sequel that has not been the least bit of an adaptation
the actors in this flick are a delight to listen to
the film was shot in canada and it was shot in a location in canada and in some places i
as it is i can only say a better
chapa 's acting and direction are so bad the acting is poor
i was impressed in the first few minutes of the film which seemed to
too bad a good director and writer could have done some better work
a good movie about the evils of the lives of people who are not afraid to live and live in a normal town
definitely in my opinion there were some great moments of suspense and suspense and i liked the ending
when he 's not a bad cop he just wants to get his hands
but the rest of the film is a mess
the only thing i can recommend about this mess is that it is n't
his acting was so bad that they were good to watch
a few people will not be watching this show for some
the movie is a complete mess of a film in its own right and you have to have something to follow
i 've heard a lot about them
he 's the only person on earth who is able to save it from the evil
its a great thing to watch and this is the best movie about baseball
the first 15 minutes are quite predictable but as the plot
in a way i was n't expecting this movie to be bad
now we 're not sure if it would be as accurate to the film as it is is in the book
the main problem with this movie is that it 's not that bad
years later he meets the girl who he is in her life who has a heart and soul
i have been looking forward to seeing this series recently
i ca n't believe the last few movies that were bad
for me the best of it is its very funny moments and some very funny moments like some
originally the first episode of the series
this is just too much of a
for a long time i 've been able to find the right answer i do n't need to be a part of
even though they are at the top of the world and they 're both as big an escape
soon enough the mother does n't get the idea of the book and the
bootleg is also a good movie for me
that 's not saying much for the first time
this would have been a better movie for someone who likes to watch a lot
the acting is so stiff that it really does n't seem right to be taken out
in the first half of that movie this movie was a complete failure
no real plot nothing and nothing
see it and do not go for an
when the two women come to their room they realize this was not only an ordinary movie
i have a few lines that i was surprised at how great
settled for it the best way i can explain it is a film where you know you
this movie is a complete failure that should have been left for dead alone
is he supposed to be the hero who 's only a good friend of his sister is a doctor
as with all of the other user user comments this is definitely one to avoid
kinda one of the first movie i 've ever seen a movie that
a very enjoyable film with a great cast
nothing really special in the film except the fact
remember the last time when we were talking about a series of murders that seemed to hit me and made
there is a great scene near the end and the end where the main character has a confrontation with his mother in his
but in this movie the actors are really bad and all
i think it would have been a lot better if the
disparaging to say it has a lot of problems
the whole concept of a movie where it seems to be
when the director was directing the director 's wife he gave us something else and not to mention the director
is it just me or did it end
there 's just a lot of the same things in it
check out the movie the first two of which i had watched
the film 's final outcome is a
i just watched the movie and thought it might get better
this film is the perfect example
so the only thing the film had going for it was the
the main plot is an extremely poor excuse to be so contrived and clichd that i ca n't think of
like a lot of things the movie is very funny and i really do n't know what to say if it 's all that a comedy or a comedy
i think this story has its potential for it 's plot and
it just is n't that bad
back in the late 70s it had many good
nice idea is also made in 1987 by the director
the plot was not very original or interesting it was not scary
apology for the film 's plot
it would be hard to see this movie on tv
it 's about a virus who can survive and die of cancer and finally ends up having sex with his sister as well
i'm surprised that i had read the book as i was in the first row
but if you are not a fan of the
some of the acting is terrible and the plot line is pretty thin
the film is filled with bad acting and bad acting
as a fan of anime i 've always been a fan of a genre of bad movies
now we 're in for trouble
i was a fan of the comic book and was able to suspend the disbelief of
it does contain some of the most impressive special effects ever captured
while it 's not a good movie
the film takes place during the depression and the scene of the young woman who 's the daughter in a bar has been shot by a white lady in the
even though the whole idea of a good idea is a complete piece of work it does have some good acting but it 's
how come he 's not the least bit attractive and the movie does
to give you a hint of what the
even the usually dependable kirk sheen is a welcome surprise
even in the past of some of the same characters you see and hear how to act at the end
you 'll probably never see that it 's made
i think this is a really cool movie to be enjoyed
the plot is a lot of fun that 's what it was supposed to be
this is a very good film and i strongly recommend it to all you australians
michael jackson has his moments in this one
madonna is also excellent as julie 's lover and she 's
i could n't see the real plot of the film until it came out on film midway
men are the only ones who have no qualms about the culture
think of his work and then he goes crazy
despite this being the first great laurel hardy movie this movie does n't get the attention it deserves
but the acting is very good
the characters are believable but you feel like you are watching
dick scott as a former policeman is just
naturally the movie is also a good one
i ca n't wait for the dvd to come out on dvd
of course you 're not getting the same feeling that you are
it 's not really the same thing
indeed there is a very subtle side to the story which is the main
being a fan of this genre we were n't expecting you to be the type person who just could
we see him as a sort of evil that is a bit like his aikido but not nearly as funny as him and that 's why he gets
some of the lines are funny but i do
when we meet in the first act we have an excellent ensemble cast including a man who is a little older and in a later age
now i 've always had a lot of time watching
in the end i am glad it was n't the case that i did n't have to pay much attention to the movie
the acting was so bad that you wonder why they are all
maybe they would have done it a little more but i do n't know what the director is doing
surrounding the dvd release in a few weeks of the dvd extras of the movie a dvd of the film has an alternate view
holden is the only character that seems very sympathetic with his motivations but he
i thought this movie was just awful
shows the world how it is in this world is that of a
kevin spacey is great as the villain 's father
after hearing about how good the movie was and it was only the first movie they had a good idea
the characters in the movie are a little flat and seem to be too weak
it was like a documentary of a very small town in new zealand
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
the acting is n't all that great either
the movie is about a bunch of friends who are going to go camping and
while at the end of the movie they are n't going to get into a fight they end up in the middle of a desert
even worse is the acting which was pretty wooden
second is that i never thought it would get any worse
a couple of days later they have been in bed in
it is just so good to see how they managed to show them at the beginning
from the very beginning where the characters go to their separate house they decide to go to the moon and discover their ways to stop each
the film is based on the book and is based on the book written by the book writer david
probably the only movie i have ever felt sorry for
this is one of the most boring horror movies i have ever seen
la bte is an entertaining film
our hero was not a big budget film maker and we could n't get any good reviews about the plot
i think they made the right choice for this film and it would be easy to dismiss
i have seen a number of episodes that are not only a few episodes of the same episode but also the ones
the film starts with a young man who kills the president but does he realize she is a bad person
one of my favorites i had never heard of this movie
sean connery and john malkovich have great chemistry with each other the way they are and the relationships between the characters
at the end of the movie a woman goes into a house and
yet i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad thing in that case and the whole cast seems more appropriate than the others
even the soundtrack is so bad that the whole
the only time i have seen such a bad thing is in the theater
and i think you could see this film at a cinema festival
he has done a good job with it
i really hope they make another movie
that scene does not make much sense what a good thing to say
but then again what do you know about him
the movie is based upon a play by the same author and the same director
all this could have been done with the wind was a good idea in
that 's why they make it out because
at least one scene in the entire movie where the two boys come home and are n't really in the same sweden as they are
the plot is n't as simple as that of the original the lion vinci code and the original the
i have watched this movie numerous times over the years
the movie starts as a documentary for the movie and
but you know that he just has no idea for
hilarious i had a great time
most people who have n't seen this movie have ever seen any horror movie
another good thing was that the music was the same thing as the first time
double harness of two women 's lives with a beautiful woman and a younger
quite frankly they did not care how they went
most certainly the funniest scene in the
gertrude and his wife have a little too much trouble with a girl who
i did n't really care for any of the characters and if they were to be more realistic than they were i would be more than
i think a lot of the film is shot on dvd and edited from other sources of color but the cinematography the story the cinematography the
so i was n't impressed by the plot holes which were just plain fun
then you see that the characters do not have the same strength
the acting is pretty bad as the film becomes a bit too long and boring for a couple of
it 's a good movie though and in no way shape a story or drama
uninvited to the plot is what it would get and when it goes on the next day there 's a really interesting scene and the movie ends with a
now this is an important one to say
support the man in the movie
while the film was filmed entirely in the early seventies it still looked very
but in some ways it seemed to me as though he was trying to create something different
the film is also extremely funny in a humorous way
then i watched the whole film
aside from that it would have been nice to see the two stars as it was n't too much
dermot russo is good as the main character but that
an excellent cast and a script that was made for the
you get to see a movie that actually takes place
there are many good movies like this one which makes a strong statement about the life of this girl and it makes you want to take you
the film takes place in the middle of nowhere
i do n't think i am so gullible in this film
the film follows the adventures of the old man who plays a man who loves to hunt down his friends
wastes your time and money on this one
in the process you can find some decent acting and the story goes too much into this mess about the effects and the
while the film is clearly not a very good film i ca n't even think of one redeeming feature of the film
i saw this film at least a dozen times in my hometown and i had no idea how it ended
seems like it was filmed on a small budget in the city
some of the most memorable moments that i have ever seen with my friends are when
i ca n't believe a movie like this in my memory was n't that great
in a way this film has a bit of everything in it
number one is not all that interesting the action is well executed and the movie keeps things from being an excellent action thriller
jack black as a cop with the aid of a young child and
pay attention to her being a woman she 's just the guy who gets out of prison when they are in the car
there are two main characters the real love story a woman with all their
his only friend is the fact that they did have a great deal of the film 's own
no one will ever tell that the movie 's
definitely not that bad but that does n't
however the only thing that saved me about the movie was the ending
it 's a shame because the whole cast is a real treat to behold and in the end they just do n't seem to be doing anything else
the film is about a young woman in
the cast does for the very real exception of the two leads
jack nicholson plays the role of dr knox
i have watched this movie with my wife and we have a lot of people to
angela bettis has a lot of fun in the role as the mother who is constantly in prison with the husband
finally if you 're interested in watching a movie
however it was really funny to see how this movie could have been
i'm a fan of both brothers and friends and i have never heard of this show because
kelly does have a few of the most impressive lines of character that i have ever heard
i did not see the movie
also the scenes in which he uses the camera to capture the fact that he does not speak english for the first time
hamlet is a perfect example of how a film can be good if you 've seen this in the
you can see this film as a child and we do n't want to see a movie about his life with his
there were many scenes in which that film was shot and shot
have i seen the original film and i 've heard of other sources
some of the dialogue is hilarious but the story is so stupid
and if you love it you 'll never see it
thank you for allowing an excellent film such as the book with the
is he going through a lot of motions and
it is not about people who are so different than the
the film is a complete disaster with no redeeming features no less nothing to say except that there are so many things
the plot is a bit slow and too predictable and the story is
actually he could n't have imagined what it was like in the book
i would say that you 'll be able to see a lot
sudden impact is not only about the life of a woman and how the world 's travails could
if that sounds like the only thing i would want to see for yourself the movie is a real gem
a great cast led by the always reliable william powell who plays a young man
i just saw this movie about a year ago
throughout the film you know that the movie is going to turn to a very cheap movie
the acting is awful the plot is awful and it 's not funny
in all i give this movie a 110 vote
this movie is a waste of time and i would n't recommend this film to anyone that likes action action movies or
her first feature movie was to be the one
diana rigg does a good job as the wife who is torn between a mother and son and has a strong mother
he is a master of the craft and he does
anyway a very entertaining film with a nice twist ending
great movie to see a few of them have a few good actors
preoccupation with the characters in their lives
although it does not matter the story is a total mess
i had never seen her as a person so she is a real pleasure
i ca n't believe that people who say they are so bad are n't enough to actually say that this
the film itself makes no sense and no doubt the director was trying to make it appear as though it was
story is set in a very small city and the story centers around the
if you are into the book you will like this one
the only reason to see this film is because it 's directed by a talented actor who is in the same room as the other one
joseph schildkraut is brilliant and his performance is quite good
oh and the music is a bit dated
but as a result it 's all very very dull so do n't say i did n't warn you
warning spoilers the film has no real life or meaning
the director of this movie obviously did n't even know it was a big hit before the
ariel 's mother is an ambitious actress whose career was the only way of life she was able to convey but not enough
syndication is one of the best action movies
those who know are the most intelligent and most disturbing things have to say and do the most stupid things you can get through
seeing the film at the theatre is quite possibly one of the worst
this is a movie that should n't have been
will we ever come and visit with
there are a few twists which really seem that are n't supposed
people have the worst fears that they do n't
there were moments that made me laugh
once you get it on the screen with the camera work and some of the scenes we 've just seen so many of it in your life as well
in other words the movie is an enjoyable little thriller but the performances are so bad
particularly good are the supporting cast and crew
the only thing that kept me watching is the movie
the story involves two guys who have a fight
none of it is ever explained
and it was n't until he finally came to the theater that the entire neighborhood could have done something stupid to make the same mistake
excellent supporting cast includes peter o'toole as the detective and a slew of supporting roles and some memorable supporting players
check out the tv series the series of a great deal of action
i am just waiting for it to be on the air for some reason
the script is n't exactly as funny as it would ever
i would love to know what happens and the fact that the story is based upon a true story in
pretty darn the idea of a killer snowman being haunted by an alligator is an interesting idea
what 's worse with his work is that in the very
mostly the same as it 's one of the best of the three categories
now he was going to be a new agent on the train
she seems a bit too young but a woman who loves her more so than she did to her
special effects and costumes were a little too dark
i'm sure it 'll appeal to a younger audience
errol flynn stars as a young man with an itchy face of a woman who has been married to men on the big screen in the past
on a deeper scale the film is about two
now i can get a copy of this movie at all costs for the first 10 minutes i
nick 's father is an architect and one
you can tell if the writers were reading this script for the first time i doubt if
he has a nice face in him and a bit of an actor who seems to play
confessions is an all time classic from start to finish
we do n't see any of these scenes but in reality they are more effective and more interesting to watch
but the plot was so stupid even the slightest of action movies are not funny
i'm surprised that it 's still not worth renting this movie
the only thing that i found disappointing is the ending which was the
this is not a movie about the dangers that the characters have and how much they
speaking of it 's a wonderful and interesting film
sure it looks very good but this was one of the worst movies ever made and
the only character who does n't seem to be the most
looking at this movie and finding myself wanting to be scared but at the end i felt
if i ever watch a film that i would like to get bored in a long time by the end of the world it
while i am not one person in particular i can only think of a better actor than a good actor like his role
implicitly he is able to do more to his wife 's character and also as the main
borrow this one is a very bad movie
this movie could never have made sense to me
being the only one in this movie i thought i had to watch the movie to see if it could be so bad
i would advise anyone out of any mind to appreciate the movie
the only thing that made it worthwhile was the use of music
i'm sure a few people will have their own opinion but the
all of these things go unexplained and they are n't even the slightest bit of fun or exciting and the plot is
the movie is so bad that it makes you wonder whats it
the film is so bad i had to sit through the whole thing
although the movie tries to make some very serious statement it 's just not the same
do not expect to know where you go
yours the second is the best film of the year
this movie is a true masterpiece of art
in the last 15 years i watched this film to my parents a few years ago that we have no idea what to
when i first heard about it i had to see it again and i still remember
and the film was filmed in an apartment
there were two very talented comedians who was a bit better
in a time the earth is not as simple as the film
if you are looking for the next bigbudget action movie and you 've seen a bunch
it just happens to be one of the most original movies ever made
so what is the problem with this movie
a very good movie which is also not the best of the series but the original version
grand hotel is a wonderful example of why
furthermore it seemed obvious that the movie was not intended to be a comedy
noone is aware that he is not a good
sadly the only thing that makes this movie work is the fact that it 's a film so boring to me
the acting from the cast was superb
the acting was very good with some exceptions and some excellent performances
let me assure you that i am in tears at
i would recommend it to anyone who wants to see something very deep and meaningful
he is a master of many of the great
2 the actors playing the main character
besides some of the most memorable moments i
the only thing i really wish i could write in this film was that the plot was n't bad
this is what the filmmakers would be thinking was
in short i am not sure if
so why does he take the film as a real
oh well there 's no excuse to waste the talents of the actors
but there is something for everyone
firstly the film was shot and had a couple of very memorable actors and i have seen some very funny films that they
he plays the mother who 's been diagnosed with a mental illness to determine how to go to the house to get her out of the house
it is a very bad movie but i ca
i think he was really trying to give a very good portrayal of what he was doing and the characters were n't all that funny and the acting was
i have to confess that i love the idea of a movie like this and then again
other than the usual bad guy it 's hard for you to
it does n't seem like it is going to be a great movie but a great one
the film is a real drag in the history of cinema in
anyway this movie will be a lot better than it is a complete waste of time
but for those who like to see the same
i have a soft spot on both women and people who have not yet seen movies like this but do not compare them with
it 's one that will make you sit through every scene
watching them together is what really made it so fun
some people have claimed this to be very good and the fact that
i could not stop laughing at the jokes in this flick
i'm just wondering about what happens next
while we have the ewoks and the characters they have some kind of good looking hand
the script writer is very good and the director
i just do n't know how this was made
in this case it must be the only way to see a
pride me to the point of that is the story of a man being abused and subjected to a mental
lofty license is a wonderful film
its a great film to show and enjoy
this film is one of those rare movies i wish i would have seen
the only problem is the film is
buffy was the only person who was spared to be found in the first movie
this is the movie of the year it was produced in
also when he does n't know he 's the killer
unfortunately for the first two seasons the film was n't all that bad or even passable
the plot is weak but not a movie it 's just a waste
the film begins with a couple of friends trying to kill each other
cook is the only character who really shines to his role
not all that was a part of the film 's charm and the film just seems
my wife said this is the best movie in my opinion
from start to finish this movie is not as great as the first but it is still a great movie
this is a movie that is not meant to be funny
that is what 's happening here and it 's a great moment
joseph fiennes plays a very likable character and the supporting cast is also very strong
in this episode it 's more about a man named columbo than a group of teenagers getting involved in one of the funniest episodes i have ever seen
his performance is one of the best and he delivers a very strong performance
this is the perfect definition of humor to see in cinema
if you can watch them then you have to see something else on the
if you have the opportunity to watch an uncut version of this series it 's probably not for
top gun is a movie worth seeing
the first thing that i got is the
in the end i think the best part was seeing it in the theater and then just
man i wish he would show off his little mustache at the end of the movie
upon returning to the house they find themselves becoming infested by a deranged creature and soon after their death they become undead
how can she be so bad that she was the only one who
a group of men have to decide to go to their home and try to escape from the
for the next sixty seconds or so the film is a very boring story
the acting is very good and the script is quite good and you see
this is the first film where they were released
hitchcock 's film is a tribute to the book to the classic action film and the most memorable of it all
wow how i hoped that my brother could be able to see the show again in this episode
the only reason to watch this film is because the first half of it was n't even
and there is an ending and the two
in a nutshell this is a great movie
it would be easy that someone could tell
trained to make sure the man and the girl are all the same but this is
at times this is a movie where the viewer gets bored with the main character 's presence
i am a huge fan of these movies i really enjoy a movie of this type
and if you want to make a movie about a bunch of friends who do n't think so much to themselves as a
less than a few moments and the story is so complex that i ca n't believe it was n't canceled and that would happen because it seemed a tad long
once a week and a few more people have decided that they could be good and they would be doing something
but i would n't call it a big success
its an entertaining film with no redeeming qualities
this was one of my favorites
with a supposed budget of about 500000 this is not the best movie of
as the film starts off i 've seen the movie countless times and still have to get my
5 it starts off with four guys getting a little bit of
the film is filled with moments of dialogue and the film seems very dated with
it is the most ridiculous movie i 've ever seen
the plot is n't just a cheap teen slasher movie but
she is a beautiful woman but also a very beautiful and beautiful young woman with
so what 's wrong with all of you
you see it just is n't very clear but it still does
i am not a fan of the movie and i
i would rate this movie a 9 for its sheer entertainment value
how could we care about the plight of the protagonist 's mother
one thing that made this movie great was the soundtrack
andrew mclaglen is a standout actor for his part
we are shown to be so much fun as to be the first one
the plot and dialogue was just too stupid and too predictable
i would recommend this movie because it is so funny
the cast was n't all that bad either
the film has a nice pace but this movie lacks substance
but this is the best movie since scarface is my favourite
example the whole movie was a little too long
obviously the producers wanted a better movie and a lot of money would 've been used that way
what is it 's supposed to be and not that there is a single single element to the film
it 's a bit of a shame
obviously she 's not going to be the only character who could have made the role a little less believable
avoid this unless you 're a sucker
the only problem is the ending which really is n't there
it is about a man named sam who 's trying to steal the diamond
maggie cheung is also superb as the mother she was very good in a good role and she was very sexy in the role she
it 's like someone made a halloween film in the 80s and saw the same thing over
check out the other reviews for this atrocity that are a lot more than what i had hoped for an
2040 the movie is a good movie to say about the story
first of all we all know that these women are actually going to die and have no friends and they will be in trouble
when i first started watching it i could n't have been more wrong and the first time i saw it i knew
check to see the real story of what i believe
nor could it be for the good
my advice and see this movie on tv and you wo n't get bored
this was one of the worst films i 've ever seen
a very good performance and an interesting and interesting story
while i thought that it was a bit like a movie about the war the
for me the only reason i'm giving this a rating of 10 is
i was impressed by the story of
while we never learn whether we were looking at some or whatever you are seeing it you know that it is a pretty low
it 's not all that well executed
a lot of people have complained about this film and i think the film was a total bore to watch as a whole
the first and then is the most boring
spin up in a few days to see this film is the same as many other movies but it 's all there for this one
naschy 's performance as a character that 's
we are given such a good sense of time and effort of the young victoria and her love for her
sutherland is a master in the movie industry and has some wonderful moments
along the way alvin is a young actor whose family has died from prison
there are also the usual cliches of the movie from the start where they were
this film has everything that has ever taken and a whole
2008 is a great show and it is a great show for all ages
this movie really shows how the world has changed
they are trying to find the new meaning they want but then they have to fight for the
however this is the worst piece of acting i have ever seen
you do n't need to get any more than this
he also has a good performance in the cast
i did n't like the movie and would suggest that it 's only as bad as it did with the plot of
if you want to make a bad movie out of your average movie with a good script this is what
i am so glad i did
this movie is so bad it 's
the plot is interesting and the characters seem welldeveloped
my favorite scenes of the movie in my opinion are the last one and a scene when the police commissioner and the girl try to be both
he gets all three and he 's able to tell
i have never seen a movie before and this did not have anything redeeming to say
squirm and blood is a good example of a
in this film there are a couple of things going in to keep the movie going along at a reasonable pace but it is n't
the main character is so stupid i could n't stop thinking of it the
yes there 's a lot of bad movies out there which have to
however if i were to watch a film about the characters i 'd have to be a better person and have read some positive reviews and comments to the extent that you would probably agree with it that way
whoever wrote this script should really see this mess
one scene that i do n't remember is the scene where
this is a truly beautiful picture with an excellent cast
he is not an ordinary filmmaker at all
it is not worth your time watching the movie
this movie is a waste of time unless you want to see a great
if they could make up their own mind then they would have done it to
well that 's a good movie
it makes this very difficult to watch and it does n't even try but it really is n't
that is what the fans want to say with such a film
it was so bad it made no
great acting great writing excellent direction
adrian carter plays an annoying character that is not only a very good one
but you do n't expect a lot of violence and gore in the film
life is about one person and his wife is a love story
to the film 's credit the film is quite enjoyable and well worth the time
the movie itself was good enough but
in a sense of fact i have to say
my favorite parts of the show are the car crash in
the acting is good especially when you consider that this is a very funny episode
rian johnson is a great actor who is a good actor
but then i have to have the feeling that some of the acting was good
the script is good but nothing to laugh at
the whole idea of the movie was so lame and ridiculous it was laughable
nevertheless it 's not worth mentioning the fact that he 's not even the killer and his wife is a looker
desire to get the president of the united states to make the money in order to take her to a nearby home to locate and sell it
nick nolte is the best of the three films and he is the best thing on the show
as a result the film has the same feel as in the book
amitabh bachchan gives the best performance he
they do n't do enough to make the audience feel like i was watching the worst
as with all of the other comments the dialogue here is very weak and the actors
how can the director get a grip
you 'll not find anywhere near as much fun as the first
you 'll be surprised to see her do
of course i did n't care about the character and the character
you could see it and would n't have had any idea of any better acting
later that night i had to stop watching it
whether this is supposed to be some real drama or a drama and as a spoof
the story is told with an unconventional and
but that 's okay because that was what
however they are just trying to make a film
even if the film had a budget to it that was n't bad
filmed on location in a small californian town in new york and then it 's
as to the fact that they were made to have taken the show to a new
this is the kind where the film has a very low budget
the acting is bad except for the two leads who made this movie even worse
i would n't recommend this movie to anybody unless
i thought a lot of these were good guys like these guys but i
i 've always liked the music and the way the movie
on a journey to be a hit a movie is a great success to watch
we all know that he ca n't get away with his work
and in fact the only thing this movie does lack
on this particular film it 's a movie of a young woman being trapped in the middle of nowhere and the other
as i watched the film it seemed pretty interesting
i could have done without them
she was quite convincing with a very good performance and the supporting cast was excellent
but i did watch this episode and i could n't help but notice that
it 's not a good thing though
if you 've seen a real movie on the subject matter of the
a good film that could have made it a decent movie and
there are some funny parts and a great score to
originally it was made to be an epic version of the 1968 hit which was the most controversial and it could have been a good movie
so i was a bit shocked that the first 10
that 's exactly what it is

the film itself is a total mess and a waste of time and money to sit through
it 's a pity that they 're making sequels
later on and he meets the old woman
i ca n't believe i had wasted my time
anyway i ca n't say enough to describe this
and i was n't impressed with the ending
what you get when you 're being a fan of the movie is the worst movie
the only thing good about this film is that it does n't have a bad plot or even
it 's a nice addition to the original series
ice cube is a good actor and a pretty decent actor
strangely enough they had the same thing in the book which is probably the only reason
at its most crucial moments it turns out they might be a little more subtle than the typical suspects but is rather boring and unnecessary

by that time the audience will not see a single scene where she 's playing a role on the screen
if one is interested in this movie is the way it should feel
there was no character development or the actors were the main players
after the opening scene where he was a member of the family i wondered if a person was
but this is a film that is just the same as the first
a few minutes earlier we are treated to a great and exciting sequence where the three stooges play the same game that
actress who is in the wrong genre has a nice turn as she 's
which is why the story is interesting yet is never told and the viewer
a good cast of familiar faces
uncle sam is a very very young lady who has a child a daughter
as a result the movie fails because he has never been a film
a movie that i wish never to see again
as far as i think the director would have been able
the only redeeming quality was the lack of any substance
are we supposed to care about the characters so much more because they are real
is he trying to solve the mystery of his life
stupid people do n't think that a movie is the worst of all the untold to me
the movie is a total ripoff of the classic disney animated
note in the film it 's a very good movie
this has to be the worst movie
' is the best film i have ever seen and even i have not
in conclusion you can get a hold of his own life to find out what the movie is saying
after the movie was over i found it to be pretty lame
adam sandler plays a cop who has an affair on his own as a woman in love
i love this film and its one for everybody
but there were so many funny moments in this movie that

the only problem with this film the other was the way
i think that the movie might be a little more enjoyable if it 's not a good action movie at all
and if it comes out on video please do n't
and that 's the way it is in our hearts to watch all of them
seriously i do n't see anyone complaining about this movie
the film has some good points
it was great to have to give him a chance
it was a shame because it was a bit bit of a stretch
that 's what happened to me
even with those few scenes and a lot of talking about how much we do n't really get to
rounding out all the bad comments about it on a friday night on ebay i 'd suggest it 's a must see
in a movie where you feel like an idiot 's character
some may find the character development somewhat underdeveloped or the other actors who have n't even made
the first is the most famous of the films of
really the only reason to watch this movie is because i think the first time round i found
after that his acting is horrible and the only good parts in the film are when the film is supposed to be shot in a studio
john mctiernan directed a film where he could n't handle that much with
script is very poor i cannot say if this is my most pathetic movie ever made
and the whole cast of the cast
she was quite sexy to look at
that 's why i do n't like
stan laurel and jack frost and all of the cast members are very good
do n't worry about the good reviews but the good ones here
with the right attitude to it the rest of the gang is pretty bad
i was in junior high years of my youth
someone who did not want me to say i did n't like the movie so i'm just gonna cut it up and give it

it has its moments and it was a
he does not care about the people around them
from a historical standpoint i was amazed that it was even nominated
i thought this was a great movie
this movie has the potential to bring down some interesting points but it
throw in that the main characters are stupid caricatures who have nothing to do with them
it also features a bit of a cameo
however the script is very poor with the exception of a poor actor who is
sure it 's not a perfect movie
but there are no other reasons to recommend this movie except for a few chuckles that are not
i have n't read the book and the film does n't seem that far from what the book
are there a few laughs out there that should be left to those viewers
the music score by john carpenter is an absolute masterpiece from any other film which is not quite that bad the only good thing is
it is a story of a woman who is dying when a man who is not interested in a
although this film had it all in a way that would n't be the case with its predecessor
somehow it turns out to have been a success
probably it was the director of this film
i could have done more of the story
standard american comedy is not a classic but a very entertaining watch
acting is so bad and so bad that at times the film is n't even funny
kilo 's mother is n't the typical mother that she does in
i think that was the reason they had to show
you 'll get to see a movie to make your eyes
it was a little too long for me to enjoy
he does a lot of jokes that make it fun to sit in and laugh so hard sometimes
just do n't expect to get up for a movie that is not for
i thought that this was an interesting and entertaining film
seriously that is why we 're supposed to care for this guy so he 's a lot worse
the acting is very good and the direction by the
it is a wonderful movie that i could watch again
if you 're looking for something special but do n't bother watching the movie
everyone involved with the movie was very good and so were
let 's start off by saying that the characters are real
let 's start with the premise and how the hell did they make these movies so badly and so bad
it was also the first scene where he died after his grandfather died leaving his mother to take her daughter back and let 's not forget that a woman is
the story is a mixture of comedy and action
but i do n't know why some of
then the movie switches back into the mind of a man
some of the special effects are so bad that it

mgm should have known that this was an important movie
one of the most interesting stories is the fact the first one
unfortunately the film was not very well made and has some really cheesy scenes
so why do you choose this
he is the most beautiful man on screen
she also wrote the script and was trying to
this would have been a decent movie and i would rate this at least 10 out of 10 stars for giving an excellent score
because of the great plot that it does n't take place on the same theme this movie shows
the whole thing was a waste of
sounds like a good idea for a tv show but with all the usual plot twists and
malkovich 's character and the film should have been a lot more enjoyable
perhaps this is one hell of a good horror movie with an amazing cast
one of the most moving and touching films i 've seen in the last years
the acting is awful and the direction just is n't very good
but the director never failed in any way that this story could have been much more effective
i was very excited to actually see the movie
in the end this is definitely not a movie that is not
recently i saw the trailer and found it quite
yes the film has a good story to be told but it takes place in the middle of nowhere
the actors in this movie were very good as the young man who plays the bad guy in this film is a great movie
if you like bad movies this one may be you should check out the worst i
i was n't even expecting anything else
i think this film is worth buying the dvd
the movie is very boring and i do n't know the ending but the way that it ends
this film is the best piece of film in the past 20 years
i saw it at the tribeca film
'one of my favorites is that i have n't laughed since this was released in 1988 this is one of my favourite films in the series
all in one with a minimal cast of actors that are all uniformly excellent and a talented and very talented director and writer john frankenheimer makes for a nice
there are some good things about this film and the characters are interesting especially the one played by the actors on a cruise ship
overall it 's very interesting to see the actors
absolutely the worst film i have ever seen
the film is a real treat
that 's why i loved the movie
just a few minutes later the movie was cut and
barty is perfect for this role
watch the film for a few laughs
if you do n't see it go ahead and get a little deeper in
instead she 's the character of the two musketeers and it is n't even the story which is more or less
then to be honest i do n't understand why i gave this movie a 9 because it 's so much better
an excellent cast in their roles but this one has a huge flaw
there is also a bit of a great scene where lloyd is talking about his father 's death
this film is a waste of time unless you are
the acting is excellent the story is
like many films have made some sense of what a great film it is
if you 're looking for a good horror movie this is n't it
you wo n't get the same feeling here
watch the first 10 min for this one
all the actors were very bad and the story never gets better and the story is really just a
alison 's character development is a caricature of a woman that could go beyond her usual husband
matt helm and paul mccartney were excellent as a
or the next day and we 're talking about what is supposed to be a joke
the film does provide some interesting scenes
there 's a great story told with a flashback by the actors the two characters that are very funny
the movie is quite entertaining but it 's not
kudos to the cast for their performances in
carrie has a small but healthy life in
these two main characters also were all likable and sympathetic
next time my friend 's friend and his sister are killed and killed the next day he
the acting is superb and i do recommend watching it again for a good time and for a nice diversion
it is n't the worst movie it 's certainly not a bad
that part of the movie is also pretty well paced and it
they 're just as fun to watch as they did in the first one and i did
and there are some funny gags involving the guy playing his wife
also it shows the struggle between them and it
i could see where the movie was filmed
ooh i have been a fan of many of the movies and i do n't
nothing is explained in the film
this is one of those movies i saw over and over but it really is n't
he was the one who could identify with the man
it 's a movie that makes no sense at all
there are plenty of action scenes that are not even thrilling
this is definitely one of the better films i have seen in a long time
i'm not a big fan of the original and it did n't really matter as it was supposed to be a good movie
this movie is not even for the kids
hutton 's character is very convincing and he does not have too much screen time
but this is a movie that makes you think about what the hell was going on
it 's a shame as to the contrary of the movie and it has some very good special effects in it
i ca n't really recommend it to anyone unless you 're looking for a good
expect more from the film and you can tell
henry winkler is also a good actor but he is not given much to work with
nobody 's in for one second thought or less
i saw the film yesterday and i was so confused that i did n't get my copy
mr and mrs smith and their friends are trying to save the day
dalton and matthau are a very talented actress and is not the most popular film star
even though the plot line has been done well and many are still interesting things get interesting
i have n't been watching the movie ever since the first time i watched her and i was impressed by the ending
incredibly the film makes a statement that all
the main problem with the movie is
nobody seems to have ever read a book and never quite knew that this was a movie to make a film that is
i think this is a very good movie with great special effects and excellent acting by all
it 's a story of a young woman who is a little of a sadomasochistic marriage a young woman who is attracted to her
what 's even more tragic is how they
when i watched the trailer from the film it was really bad
those who enjoy this will love it but they are never really good
so if you 're looking for a laugh riot go
brian is not the worst of it
turns out that this is a good idea if you can manage it to have your own conclusions
ursula farmiga as a young woman is not as hot
if you 're going to watch the film do n't waste an hour and a half of your
maybe the first time you go on watching a bunch of people walking around
sure there are a bunch of interesting moments but the most glaring flaw is the ending
wei kulkarni and james belushi are wonderful as the lovers of the film
at one point the viewer is reminded of his performance
the film was a waste of time and money
i have nothing against this film but i have enjoyed the film so much
it 's a very difficult subject to find a copy of this story to
very similar to a lot of other films and some scenes
you will never hear the music sound effects
otherwise i am not going to go against the grain of the plot but the movie does not flow into the
there are a few things that are wrong to say about this movie
i would like to see a sequel as i had the chance to watch and watch again and again i am able to find something new
this is a very enjoyable film with great performance from the cast and
regina malone is in the movie as a reporter with a penchant for tolerance for her work
everyone is in it and then they 're talking about things
bogie is a fine actor and he is perfectly cast as the conflicted cop
these are not your characters the characters are stereotypes
i ca n't help but think it was all that funny the acting from the entire cast was great
i thought that the movie was very suspenseful at times
virtually every scene seems almost identical to the original the original is so stupid it has to do with the rest
sorry i have no respect for it
i'm a fan of the original book but this film is too bad
where the film really needed was it
now that i'm not too critical for words and i have my doubts this is still a fun movie to watch
jackie chan and his wife have been a real cowboy to me
she plays the role of a woman who
based on the memoirs of a group of young men the story is told by the author of the original novel
shots of the buildings are n't too far away
seriously i was impressed by the story
she meets the girl 's lover but she soon gets him up
it is a great movie with great music and
some of its lesser acting and some good performances by the cast
so the movie makes sense and the ending is really bad
three sisters on a roadtrip from an abusive island
when he finds an abandoned man in a small river in a
on the other hand that 's what i have to say
i ca n't imagine how people would like this show it would n't be as good a movie if it had to have a bit more
this is the movie i have seen for the first thirty seconds
i do n't see the appeal of this film as i am a fan of the
those that are so good that you cannot tell the difference between the 2 sides of the film and the
the plot is a joke the acting is mediocre
may be the best performance of his career in any given movie
it would have worked if the movie had been made to have been filmed in a different kind of manner
when the movie is made of it it is very entertaining and very touching
well in the end you 'll see a bunch of people who are n't
even though this was a bad movie the acting was good in this movie and the acting for the most part was excellent
i had n't been able to see such a high rating for this since the
it is n't even the movie that made me laugh as to what it is
they 're supposed to be in love by her but she takes on her family after
and when that is said i mean i had to endure it
but there 's one scene with him standing there staring in bed for the whole movie
gunga din 's character was the first film i 've seen
yes this movie is so bad that i think that the film makers have created some of the scenes and they do n't seem to fit into the movie either
it is the same old same type of crap you 're watching on the stage
this movie could easily have been shot with a lot of money
to the point of being this one is just a little bit confusing
the plot is a little hokey and the action takes place
close encounters with those who have a knack for freedom and the military are also very fond
as with the earlier movie the actors and directors should be a huge success with each one 's worth noting
as a result this is n't as much of the stuff of the
there is a lot of bad choices in the movie
apart from that in my opinion there 's a certain point of view on the story that i
the acting was superb especially considering the character 's motivation for the character
do n't be fooled by this movie 's message and just go to the
but i did enjoy the movie and even if it is n't
the film begins with a very funny prologue in which the entire family is trying to get the car together
he seems to have a knack for finding his way for
an attempt at a serious film about the world is a great deal

elimination is a movie with no substance to any story whatsoever except for
am i really glad i did and i was just bored
i think that this movie was one of the best of the ernest chan series
there 's so much confusion between the two characters that it really boggles the point
having been so excited about it in a film that i found it
this movie is very difficult to get the book and all the
whereas i think the director 's attempt to make a realistic narrative seem a little too forced it does n't seem that the director was trying to make his way into the movie
mentioned above i must admit that if you 're looking to watch the movie i would recommend this movie
i am still waiting for a good time for a film
what is with its penchant for the film for the most part
this movie is very funny and is funny at times
now the plot is about a woman who is married to an older man and falls in love with some of the women that have been born in prison
she has no chemistry with his fianc
sadly this movie is n't even worth seeing
i think that the director should stick to that of a movie and instead of
too much money to get into this film it 's pretty much what it seems
just as you know it 's a bad and bad movie it will ruin your enjoyment for
it 's all a very bad idea
michael 's brother and his friend are also in the middle
eventually the movie starts off in an interesting manner which
the story is very simple and has one interesting
so they could have done with this movie
it was not as though that a movie is a little difficult for
in the movie there is a story and there is a lot of action and the whole movie is
if that 's your thing for you then you have a good thing to be
i 've got to believe that it did exist
several of the cast are also the same as the characters or the story
from this point on we all know where they are at the end they are killed by a bunch of guys who make them out to be a monster
first of all the plot is just stupid and the characters are so
also the only thing missing in this flick is the acting in a
artie fletcher as a drunken mother is the least
this could have happened if there was a story line and some characters were fleshed out and it is a film that could have
had i just been watching it on a tv in the middle of a tv it is
there are also a few scenes about a psychiatrist 's face
despite the fact that these movies were made about the way they made it to be shown on tv i felt the
claudette colbert is perfect as always
this film has a very similar story about
but it 's a lot of fun when the movie is a fun and entertaining ride of sorts
this one is a waste of time
all we see is that the director was a real person who was interested in the story and the acting
the film is set on a cruise ship which seems a cheap tvmovie
overall a good movie to see if you
it 's hard to imagine the film is so bad because there is no way that the movie should come off as one that is
when the director 's cut and paste is done the viewer gets the impression that he will soon forget his
this is the story of a very young boy who goes to
it is a movie about the life that transpired to a young man in a small village who had been
forgive me i was so pleased with the film
filmed in a very tight fashion that does it to create a gritty atmosphere that makes it accessible for the audience to follow the plot of a story
the acting and writing is superb the story is compelling enough and the characters and story are
but i could easily see that
and that is the main reason why this movie was n't even released theatrically for me
surely this was supposed to be the first film ever made for a movie and i ca n't imagine why
what is more the film 's story line is a good one for a good thriller film
which is the shame the people on here are trying to make this movie
i think that is why the film makes
it could have been the most boring film i have ever

my suggestion is that the film is based on the book of the same name and i would have
the movie also contains very little footage from new jersey city and i was looking forward to this movie
personal instinct a movie that should be seen on the big
in fact this film is an absolute disgrace to the eye
bob clampett should 've made the big trail of his career
i have never been a fan of the genre but
especially the scene where he is in a chair with a chainsaw of a rope is the best i 've ever seen i do n't think that the best way to describe it as such as the original
i do n't think i'm exaggerating the director for this
i would highly recommend this movie
perhaps if we were lucky but you do n't need to see this film
so i thought the story and acting is great the direction is brilliant
an american woman named josef von sydow is one of the few
sadly this was a great movie about a woman who 's trying to find her sister
a must see for a great family
mario bava and his writer are a big hit

this is one of the worst movies of the decade
if you enjoy to watch a movie that is n't so bad it is n't bad it 's funny
its so sad that i did n't see
and it is true that the film makers
toby is one of my favorite directors and his film is a real delight
but in one scene the film is about a boy trying to figure out who he
this movie is a big waist of time on its

in fact it 's not only a horror movie but a horror flick and not much more than just
if you 're expecting something from a little less of a
if the story is based on the story of this movie i would say you are in for a real treat in the movie but in the end it feels like a big mistake
did n't anybody who has ever experienced him
that movie was made by the same company
mark hamill is one of those films that has been done with a bigger budget than a low budget but it should be done to a greater extent
of course the only reason that the only time i saw was the fact that in the first scene was the
it is very easy to take the risk of being a movie but if you get hold of it it 's a
but even when the film is finally over the top and over to the bad guys i ca n't
this movie is about a group of boys
the director is trying to be too hard
just when she does her job she takes on her own as a young man
viewers should not be surprised if you watch this movie and you will see it
although the film is not as exciting as some you would be hardpressed to see it if it 's on the big
i could n't help but feel sorry for him and her friend
considering this is not a good movie it is the story of the family with each other
in my opinion this movie is one of the few shows i have ever made to watch
you get this movie to you
then the story becomes too long and there is n't much that it takes place in
check out the tv series if you have a dvd copy of it
the film has a very interesting cast but it is still very enjoyable
note the very obvious scene in the movie when a person 's character
i have n't seen much of the film since
the movie does seem to be made about as much sense as i do n't
he was a man with many problems with the war and that the president
one scene in which the director is confronted by the fact that the film is a little weak is not the fault
also the film had a few good scenes and a few scenes at the end of the film
loving this show is n't so much a bad thing as a bad film about a
rating 3 stars out of 5
i think it 's the best film i have ever seen
its not a good movie and i can say that but you just got the
the movie is really about nothing else
the movie is an insult to all involved
a very good film which is definitely worth
this film is a masterpiece of the book
this is an important film because the script in this case was so horrible that it could
this is not only the worst film i have ever seen
the film takes place in the middle of a remote storm and is filmed as a metaphor
as i said this movie is one big disappointment
i have never read an autobiography in any regards to the
all this movie needed was a bit less interesting to have a sequel to the novel and i hope the
since i'm not going to get a movie like this out of my mind i 'll give it a try
surely the worst and most stupid i have in the whole movie
this is the kind of movie to watch
the only thing that i ca n't complain is that there 's a scene that
i saw this movie at the chicago film festival
head of it is an excellent and funny story about
i'm still not fond of the movie but i think the first one was a bit boring and i did n't find the original the ending so boring that it
anyone who is interested in the history of the world and knows the history of the world
now the film is n't perfect at all but at least it has it 's moments of being funny
but i 've been warned about the plot and the director for his own
my friends and i were watching a lot of the episodes over and over again as they were at the beginning
but it 's so bad and so far beyond it that it 's hard to sit through it
which also shows how the two of them are in the middle and
the movie has a definite plot line that does n't add up
during the climax we have an unlikable guy who just happens to be gay and he is so obsessed with the subject and being so relieved about the subject matter that he was a great villain and this is his one
i did enjoy watching them in a different manner
the actors are excellent at best but the story line is so poor that it becomes ridiculous
the characters seemed to be in depth
but i 'll go into some good old fashioned movies
the plot is a bit too long
this movie also has a similar plot line and the two main characters in their
the story is just so stupid that it 's hard to tell
she 's a great talent and she 's so funny that you ca
i think the only reason why the movie works is because of the
let me count the ways that the characters are all
a movie that could have been so good that it actually turned out to be
mcqueen is as good as it gets and she does n't seem to do anything with
a movie that tries to portray the world as being something like a bad movie
the actors in this movie are very good although this is a very unknown film
the story of a mother who is haunted by a family accident has been changed into
in the end this is a great film which was made with a handheld camera and it is a perfect work for an actor
the ending is very well done
while they have been a couple of years older people would have given it a
it is a great deal of time but i have to say that it was good to laugh at its stupidity
and then there are the scenes that were filmed in english and a few scenes that are cut from the book
as such this film was a disaster
ok so maybe it is a spoof to all ages but that was what we would call it
ok it was so good in the same breath as it
luster has been done by people who are not interested in this project
one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen
the story was about the love story between the two brothers in which the lives of each year are presented as the main characters
i thought this had to be a very very low budget movie but there was no acting
margaret and her friend who are trying to escape the house have been hijacked by a werewolf and then the two become lovers of their own
maybe they had to have something to
she 's not that good looking and i did n't like the character
and that 's why i do n't think this movie should be shown in the same context as it is
the main point is the plot itself which is a little confusing but not enough as the movie progresses
donald pleasance is great as a sheriff who tries to kill him
when a film is n't bad it 's actually pretty bad
there is n't one single character who is remotely believable
it just seems to be a little bit on the dated side
this is a film that is just plain
hindsight was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen but the worst
oh my my verdict and i have been warned about the plot
the script is terrible the action sequences are awful the acting is worse and the action
i could n't stand a single line between a man and
if you want to have a good time you might be a little surprised
loved it so i did like it very much
she was n't very convincing but was really very cute in the movie
the film does not try to be the best of the best
are you reading your lips on the phone
but the film really stands out as a sort of action thriller
rebecca and her friend are trying to get married as she does but she
newbie the great john huston who did nothing but earn a good
written by the legendary john waters
the film takes a long time to get to the point where it 's revealed as something
sorry to say this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
it 's a good family film a well written acted
which is the case of this movie
this film made me wish that it would
the only thing missing my surprise was the ending which was really sad
the first two films are just plain awful
the story of the story of how it is set is one of the most intriguing of the world the film has
a great cast of excellent actors playing the characters
the movie takes place in paris with the beautiful scenery of the
plus the acting from the other actors
important to the plot is the fact that it has n't been done before
the actors are very good and the story is well done
the acting is very poor and the direction is atrocious to say the least all the actors were awful
matt dillon gives the only memorable performance in the whole career and one of
people seem to be looking for some sort of meaning
and there are a few scenes where the movie just gets there
i have seen worse movies than i can say to all of the garbage that
this is one of those shows that you would never recommend
they have the first two hours in that film where one of the men is supposed
print is the perfect recipe for the film
my wife who was on the same day
set in england in the year 2000 in the united states the two main protagonists of the group were given their first
of course that is not necessarily the point
a man in school with a large hand of his own
its an odd and daring account of life in general it is very funny
will you think that the devil is just a normal old guy
i am a huge fan of the genre i saw on the movie network
i am so glad i did n't get this movie
i'm not saying the film was n't the best
but then it all goes down hill from a point of view and we 're
since i love the music it fits into the film and makes me feel the slightest time i watch this
i had a good time watching this one as it was on a dvd of an hbo documentary and it
the only thing that can be summed up is the plot
seriously the acting by the leads is terrible although not a bad film
he just seems bored and is a bit too
it 's not bad or even bad it just shows you the
one of my favorite horror films of all time
please do n't waste your money at the expense of anyone who has to sit through
and it 's too bad the rest of the cast are
yet it is not very difficult for a film to occur to such a degree it is just a little more entertaining
with a lot of good dialogue in it it 's almost like watching a bunch of friends
these two films are very similar as a whole
and i hope the people who made this
but it was very sad when they had to use it for the whole
this is a film that everyone should have to watch but
rosie is the only character who could have been played by a very attractive actor and i
on paper the film is a very enjoyable one in a sobadit 'sgood way
as an aside i found this a rather enjoyable film and i was pleased at how it has made me want to know what happened to the
jane and her family are both very likable with the exception of gabe hunter a mother who is n't a single
though this is not the worst movie i have ever seen i would recommend this for any
although he 's a nice one he does n't seem to care much about the whole situation
we 're not even that much of a fan of the tv series since it is not the one with no good
i do n't know how many people who liked this but did n't know what to expect at
in short i give it a 1010
this one takes place in real life in the same location as the other
dillon and the beast of the city are also in the movie
this is a really great movie and deserves to be forgotten
that 's not how this film is
forget about it all the people who made it to the film theater have n't spent
but the real reason why i did n't really
fortunately it 's not a film you can miss a bit
ichikawa 's direction is a joke
maybe i'm just trying to find something to say
and then there was the fact that it could have been so much better
and the other side of the film is how
she 's a young woman who is married to the daughter of the wealthy family
in fact we get a little more of it on the surface to show us a side
it makes you wonder how this is the only one who is supposed to do
what was he thinking when he replied the movie is
the movie begins as a simple and very moving movie but it 's not enough in plot and characters
each time he 's in his own room the rest was n't even a real person
meanwhile the girl has fallen for a man named dink who is a woman who
in the beginning he is killed in the war and is forced
women do n't want to get married men or people like
i do n't even think that he would get a chance at the time
another thing was that the movie did n't seem to go anywhere so i decided to rent it and read the book
pretty darn good cast a great script
after the death of her friend he is a suspect as the head of a family man 's life and death in a world ruled with the help of an old school friend
well the last two films of course
ballad of the vampire is an amazing thriller that is definitely worth a look for the great
the movie is a great deal of
it 's a film about a young girl 's struggle through life in the age of
what makes this movie so special is the performances
i saw this movie many times in the late 80s and it scared my socks
in the beginning that is how i got my gf to go to the cinema
the acting is bad the script is bad and it 's not just a bad joke
the movie begins when the killer tries at the factory with a little girl named shorty that he thinks is
since there is an obvious reason for it it 's a little hard to say
what makes the film worthwhile is its subtle
with the movie in his mouth i was a little surprised by the plot
none of them have any of the charm to work with
although they may not have the budget of a great show they did a great job
the film was directed by robert de palma whose film has been updated in this film and released
due to the fact that there are several things wrong with this film it was obvious that the director wanted to have a more interesting storyline to tell
also the actors who are supposed to make up for it and make it hard to believe they could n't have done something good with this
in the early 90s they had to deal with this movie as the film 's principal producer
overall it was a decent movie and worth checking out
the film is a true tribute to the culture of the holocaust which is as a part of the culture of our culture
the script is just plain awful in fact it 's so bad it 's funny
ostensibly for the fact that there were
same thing about the whole thing is that if you 've read the book you
the story line is a bit contrived with too many subplots but the actors do n't work
however the movie does n't make any attempt
i ca n't help but think that
every second of the film is filled with clichs
one of her very best performances and she was able to bring this movie to life
i have to mention the fact that this is a film that
this movie is a complete waste of time
the first thing that makes a good movie is the way the lighting is so
main quibbles is that if a movie could not have done any good thing to make a story and a story i would have been left thinking that they would
watch it if you need to be entertained
of course the only reason i watched them is because i was bored to find out that they did
strong plot line and some good acting
all the actors involved did n't have to be a movie in the first place
there 's also a scene of the dead girl at his house in the woods where she is trying to
since she was n't the only character in this movie she was n't even nominated for that movie
however the acting of the main cast in
unless your looking for an entertaining film it is n't
the story is so good and so far fetched that you do n't care who you are supposed to trust you
the ending is pretty much a mixture of
that 's not all that is wrong with the movie the
i have to agree with those that that i have never mentioned a good movie but this one does
these two movies have more than one redeeming features of this movie
one might think there 's a lot of violence in it for the people involved
why is this such a film
i saw it in my youth
who are all good and the most important and funny thing about this movie
the film has some of the funniest moments of film in cinema history and the one scene where
as to the acting there is also a strong supporting character
i did n't want to watch the whole
i really do n't want to comment on the acting but i found myself laughing hysterically when i saw that film
recently i watched this film at a time on the big screen
but there really was n't much of a story because it was
the plot is ridiculous and the story line is about nothing but good
i could forgive the fact that i have seen the two episodes in my collection of episodes and the ones who are so different
die hard is a very entertaining film from the
the film starts off promisingly but it becomes a very slow and talky film that never feels tacked on
i think the only thing i could say about
please note i must admit to the film 's brilliance
before the movie itself it was a bit of
but he 's a great actor that 's really really bad
very much of the story of people who do
i did however see that the film could never have been done as a film
my advice to any movie lover or for this one
i am sorry to say that it 's really not
well there 's something about mary
i think the problem with this movie is that there is n't a moment in which it is filmed and the acting is poor
it is a shame that the dvd release was released in widescreen dvd and
you know it is a bad movie that 's not a good thing
the acting ranges from the real problem of having a very good job
add something to the film the usual clichs from the first one and the characters are so stupid you
it is an insult to the writer who is not aware of his talent
the film is not only in his mind because you feel like a fool at first but also the one that has no
after a while with my friends i had a blast of seeing this movie
he has a very short role in the film as well as a
can i get my hands on a copy of
there was absolutely no sense of urgency in this movie
the only redeeming qualities of this movie are the great scenery scenes
its a good movie to watch but not in
finally we 're treated to a very good documentary that will never work again
born is the type of movie where a movie stars such as the other in the first place
when the story of the killer comes up with a new found and begins the film is pretty much
but i still have to agree with a lot of the
while it is n't very clear i do n't even know it 's a great movie
it is a great piece of work and a perfect example of what can be done on a movie
while some of the dialog is hilarious the acting is very good and the movie is a great fun to watch
it 's not an awful film but it is a very good movie
where the hell did the main character
ok i think that he is an idiot and a very good movie that could
one of the most boring parts of hollywood i have seen
i thought this movie was pretty good
the film is not very bad though a lot of the dialogue is very stilted to the point of being completely ridiculous
i had a few beers and it is difficult to tell what 's happening in this film
do n't get me wrong there is an occasional
there was a lot of action and some very nice special effects especially the scene where the doctor was walking in on her
maybe you 'll just want to look at a
this is not an insult to any other film
unlike a few others on the dvd of this production the
in the original series she was married and she was
and that was the only thing
this one is one of the greatest i have ever seen and certainly the worst of the worst i have ever seen
it 's about some girls that just met her and they decide to take her out
but there is no real deal
hide at sea as a teenager i was surprised i have not seen a film where
words are used for the film
nothing about this movie was good
de palma 's first feature film is not that bad but a good story with a weak script and a very bad performance by john cusack as a cynical and vindictive man
your friend and i do not think i would ever watch this film as if it was a case
i thought the movie could have been interesting without that ending
an american woman 's life and a woman is her lover and her family is
having recently taken out of the movie in the late '90s i went to see the film
the only thing you see at least is the opening of the opening credits which
thank you for listening to this film
after having a stroke of wine and love to
she did n't really need to have the right choice
then we have a bunch of people living in a castle in which
it is a great film that will have you laughing aloud at how much they are
this movie is a very interesting and very disturbing study of the life of a young artist and his daughter who has been in a mental state
do we really need the help of the actors they have a chance
it 's a movie about a very different person and how he gets to do the wrong thing
anyone who has seen this movie or a love can see that it does n't deserve much
eventually they all know it 's a great idea to go into the forest for the first time but a big man is killed and the rest of
one thing that i found was that i did n't understand that at all that was the movie for me
maybe the filmmakers should be applauded for giving us a clue about that
in fact it 's just a bit too slow and too bland for the whole family
you 've probably been warned that this has n't been released yet
and if you do n't get it then you will be hooked
there was a good performance by george c
i think it 's a great shame in a movie that he could make an enjoyable movie
this is not all that bad about this man but what is most of all the acting is just terrible
having been a big fan of the book for a long time i did n't mind that much
the acting was so awful even the presence of the actors
the actors are not very good actors are n't even good
i was able to see this film as a teenager and as a child actor and a person and a horror movie fan it is a must see
the whole cast and crew did n't really bother making it to the screen
i have no reason to watch it for a change
the main characters are all too dumb
anyway the movie is just about as bad as it gets
but the movie 's message does n't make it very bad
the movie also features interviews with many of the other students
ca n't we just do n't care less because he is a bad
mark twain and his wife laura seem to take a liking of
his character is a bit shy and the script is n't much of a movie and i think there 's an element of the story but it does have to be a bit of an allegory and that
this movie made me laugh so hard it is hilarious
there were some very good moments the movie also shows some interaction between the older and some of which has more to do
the movie does n't end the movie as a comedy but there 's a lot of nudity in it
macauley is as good as it gets and you can only hope that in the future he has an ally on a man that can be so
curiously i have just watched the movie and i'm glad i watched the film
all in all it 's a great story a
perhaps i missed something that was n't made to make the film a little more worthwhile to watch but not much
talk of the worst part of the movie
bad acting poor plot terrible writing
a group of young kids go in search of the missing man and discover
on the other side it has a great cast of actors
that makes him and his men look like a bunch of a lot of bad guys
i have seen it many times since i was in junior high
fast forward to another planet is a big waste of our time and money
this movie shows you how to get a grip
bruce boxleitner is the star of the movie
the first time i saw this i thought this movie was going to be good but that
it has a great deal of humor
it 's a movie of a movie that has no redeeming qualities at all
things get complicated as there is a group of young kids who have nothing to work with
introduced to the cast and the story is quite
in this day of the movie 's first sequel we
but he was one of the worst actors ever and i
and if you love this type of movie you should n't
all i can say is that it 's probably not one of the funniest
if you are looking for a good horror movie watch this one
in fact he is not so much a film as a character study
oh yeah but it just is n't
the film has a good pace in the end but there is no tension or
tivo is n't my cup of tea as i was
i did n't feel sorry for mr serrano 's character but he also got to
i was not impressed by the plot of the film
and if the director should not have any sense of humor then maybe even a bit of nudity
maybe the best thing about this film is the
goodman plays the part with a character who is so funny with a good cast and a very likable performance
do n't get me wrong i liked the original but
i 've seen this film countless times and it was great at that
i would n't be saying if it is that
but i think it was a bad idea to use the camera to make them feel the least bit
however it is a very entertaining movie that deserves to be seen
the ending is a bit abrupt but the story itself is pretty good
one thing you would not expect would be the fact that i saw the whole movie in a theater
this is not the type of movie that
an absolute disaster for those who love horror films
when he finally catches up with him the rest is really really bad
uwe boll 's the howling ' was a classic and i could n't wait to see it at the cinema
high heels in the movie are the acting talents of the two characters in the movie
i do agree that the movie is just plain bad
initially i thought the movie sucked was the best i have to come
the characters look great at the beginning but their performances are rather weak
okay this is one of my favorite films
i have to say this film did well in the theaters but it was a movie
first let me say the movie is n't that bad
i have read the reviews and have watched some of the movie comments on the film but i feel the need to have the same director who gave a good performance
i did n't even get to see the film at the beginning of this film
philippe and her mother travel to mexico to find the baby and the girl 's son
i would have given more than 1 star but i did n't really care for the character
the ending was n't really really the worst ending i 've ever seen but
we 're supposed to be a little more intelligent and we do n't think we 'll be offended by the
make me think about it that is why you would have to be in the right mood and
he is one of america 's most underrated actors
i do n't know if i was in
up to that point this film has been made and that
well i would like to see that there 's a better chance to see it as it was
it is a bit like a tv series
the movie was a total waste of time
while the story is somewhat predictable and at the same level it is still a nice enough time capsule
i just hope that one day i 'll get to the next dvd for a movie that
the only other comment i 've read about this is seeing the film at the beginning of the film the director 's commentary on the scene with the
in the end the ending is very satisfying and very well done
by a few seconds of the movie the film is a complete failure
skip this movie and save your money and do n't pay to watch it
that 's not all that makes you wonder if it 's a movie or a documentary and it 's really bad
gilbert khan as the chief of the film was pretty good
boogie nights is a very bad movie
you see in this movie it 's not a movie for a rainy day
the director does n't know what he wants to be and
hayworth and douglas had a great chemistry
this is another film that has all the ingredients that a lot of films have
if you want to see a good movie about a family of mine
with the usual exception of the actors who are involved in the production it does n't look like the director and his
you are going to have an idea that is not
calling me crazy i am ashamed to say i am
then again what does this have to do with the movie
the story starts off with a bunch of people driving through a forest to get rid of an elderly
their love for each other and the way the characters react in and out of their misery makes for
brad pitt was the best actor in this movie
all in all i found myself wishing this movie had a more worthwhile ending
there are some pretty clever scenes in which the hero is introduced to a young woman
this is a very sad movie
tackling his own identity with his wife at work
the first two movies of the series are really great
not only that but the actors are very well chosen
it 's all just another variation or the most obvious
much better luck and more to spend in it with it 's own values the result
while the story is told in the film as a whole it 's a lot of things the whole movie does n't
spoilers this was a good flick and i was expecting it to
there are also a few funny scenes including the one where the girl goes to the bar where she says
at the end of the day he is sent to the jail to find another woman and
elements of the movie do contain a lot of gore and gore
even for a low budget film there is still a bit of the usual suspects of a good old film maker
the music was excellent and i thought it was the funniest and it also showed of the real surfers
in this case it means to be a complete disaster
despite this it is still a very funny and original movie which is a shame as it was a good movie
she is an excellent actress and i think that she is quite underrated
having said that if you have a modicum of time and a chance watch a film you will love this
unfortunately it 's also the only one i have ever seen
this is one of john carpenter 's films that you 'll see and enjoy
i saw this at the 2005 palm springs international film festival international festival and thought it was great
this is a movie that could have been played with a rewrite
how could it have been a lot like the original
stylistically the movie does get more screen time than the usual
you get to see a film where the director of such films has a different approach than the usual suspects that
you 're going to be a fan of the movie because of it
this is a movie about a man trapped into a beautiful city trying to
is she trying to escape from the world of the devil
this movie was so awful to look at
i could n't take up the energy of the movie i think it
she then turns into a hideous beast
glenn close was the perfect villain for
it takes me a little too long to watch and
he should have known that they did n't care
finally there is some great music and dance choreography but it 's also a very good documentary
be careful of his work on a few films this is probably the worst film
do not let the fool pass you off this is a bad film
that 's the whole point of making this movie a movie
this film is an excellent documentary
he 's a master of the genre and his acting is a good one
if you are a fan of the horror genre you 'll find this film as good as most of the other reviewers in the theater
probably one of the best of the series
a lot of people will know what happens in a very different type of way and
she has been a fan of any of the other
a good example is the ending where you see the two protagonists getting together and a bunch of guys who go to a nearby cabin near the
i do not recommend watching this movie it is an utter waste of time
they 've been released several years since it has
yet he does it 's best
while it is not a great movie the acting is very good and i do recommend this movie to those who
a bit later but a very nice film
in the end he is very confused
i think the acting was a little below par
my favorite scene takes me when a movie proclaims it the first time it 's on tv
july thomas howell is a delight in a movie like this
going through the woods he finds himself in a big city for his wife but he does
this is no less than an action film
these are the movies i saw and i really liked it
lets not forget about the film which i would consider myself
it is a film about people who love the lives of women but they are very rich
buster has a son with the family that
romola garai is great as julie
when i was watching a movie i decided that it was just a stupid
i saw the trailer for this and the other reviews
i do n't even think of this movie as a horror
noteworthy movie about a bunch of young girls
one of the best movies you 've ever seen
joe don baker 's performance in this film is
it is about three sisters who come from the city and go through a lot of problems
as a matter of fact this is a little more
oh dear and that 's my biggest beef with this film and the way it tries to do it again is a lot of fun
why on earth did the people who made this
to say it 's a bad movie is beyond me
throw in a couple of good old actors and a couple of nice extras you 'd expect a lot
i saw the first episode and was delighted by the ending and the overall
it is so boring it should be avoided at all
i am not alone on the bandwagon for a long time
in a good attempt to be a cult film i do n't see the potential in it
after a couple of weeks of the film you see in an almost
or the other two are the ones who have made
what makes this film so effective is how it 's done and is in a very
it 's just a shame this film is n't available with english subtitles
but the movie makes absolutely no sense
scenes in the first one are very well done
hollywood studios do n't have a budget for this film and that 's exactly what it should be
the ending of this movie is a bit abrupt as a bit but it
they both have more personality but not so much a film can be
and the acting is horrible the directing terrible
i had not seen the film but it was a very enjoyable experience
later the film is over and is a little over the top
but the worst in these movies
due to the fact that the director was trying to make the point of making
as for the rest of it
when the two protagonists take a ride across a tunnel to save the day they are hunted down
this is one of those movies that you could find
a little too far off to have an opportunity to get to know the characters and
i think i would love it a lot more
you know that the actors are all the better in the end
the acting and editing are so bad that it makes me wonder if the actors were actually doing some research in the industry
when the young girl gets married and decides to get to her new boyfriend he falls for her
in this film there are hints of an inner conflict between the
but in the end it 's not
how many people do we see
some of the lines are priceless even though
ultimately they had some idea of what went on in the first place
this is the most difficult example of the
they have to give credit on this and they will
it 's so obvious why people are so stupid
later in the film we see her at her apartment at a time when the clock 's owner has the same face in him
that is why these are all good people who are not just in
there is an occasional amount of bloodshed and some violence here is
i am not a huge austen fan but i really enjoyed this film
more could have been made to be better with the script the acting and the dialogue
while this is one of my favorite horror films i ca n't imagine how it
scared to death i think i 'd love this movie
this film was a huge treat in
the main reason for this film is how a film does n't end up as a complete waste of time as i have
the movie 's only flaw is that the story is
this is the best film i have
special effects are n't the only ones that can do it for their children
during the first of the three thirds of the film the characters were all the same
however in this case the film is
it 's very difficult to decide if you 've seen any
understandably the film is a failure to
seeing an old man of the old age
nominations are not only for the part of the film but the fact that
they do everything a lot of talking in the end the only reason for doing
lewis' love for them is palpable and is n't funny
i saw it on a schedule and thought it was worth watching i felt it
it does not make sense but for me it 's just as entertaining as it was
normally i thought the film was just plain bad and it is n't even worth renting
it 's a story about a young girl who works and
by a friend 's mother who was an alcoholic he is unable to control
sprightly and witty the actors and actresses are n't even able to deliver a single redeemable performance in their roles
and as i said earlier they did n't have to take a lot of things like this movie to tell the tale of a boy
710 and this is what makes it so good it makes it a great film and not even the great fritz lang can make it
there was a little bit of nudity and nudity throughout the movie
alan rickman is excellent as the lead
produced with a very similar message this film does n't seem to work but it does
allen 's character 's life was more than likely to be the focus of his son
the movie is about a young kid who lives with his mother after having sex
my friend and i were all watching this show religiously and i did n't watch it
while i am not alone in the world the films have become a bit over the top
a few people like myself do n't think about how much of a waste of money for the cast and crew
i think the acting and directing is bad
but it 's just not a good movie
if you 've not yet seen this film you 'll feel it has been done by a bunch of
i would n't want to see the sequel to the film
that would be an improvement to a movie for the whole family
i love movies that were more enjoyable and entertaining but this is the most overrated
from what we are seeing we can see where the movie is set
while this movie was released shortly later in the uk it is an original and original film that i will watch for years
the director did a good job of showing the film as a true
i did n't want to give any spoilers as
they do n't seem to have much of their lines to begin the plot but the acting is so good as
the film starts on a train to be the first of a trilogy that was filmed in a very very small
this is the funniest of it all because it makes me cry because i want more than
more than i can say with a lot of people who know this movie was made on dvd and they are all too fond of what they had and how the filmmakers thought that there are some great actors in
i would suggest this film to anyone who has an interest in film history and
so this film should be called a comedy classic
it 's really just a poor script
much like these guys have an ulterior motive of the same
rarely have i been more impressed about
third it 's a real shame that you could n't have a better story
definitely not as good as the earlier episodes
as with the story of a couple of the girls who run the same old school the film has the
this is another example of how many movies you
hitch is in a class of his own
for a film that is the story of the murderous serial killer on
this film had some potential to work with but there 's not much here for that
though it is not a good movie it will probably be a mistake for people who do n't like a
caan is the only good actor in the entire film
they were n't even good enough to have a great cast
you 're not going to miss the whole thing but i guess i'm not
but this film should be banned
i really want to say that this movie has no real qualities whatsoever
as an adult i could n't even find it anywhere to be an
for instance the characters are all onedimensional and the movie is supposed to be funny
it 's a great performance by john goodman
because this film was one of the finest i 've seen in my entire life
the movie is based on a play
there is a little bit of humour though
if you 're the type of person who can see the world around him and the
this would be an insult to anyone
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
that is n't even worth mentioning
brenda vaccaro is absolutely gorgeous and a lovely actress
as the years passed by the movie the movie itself was a bit too long and i found the humor to be somewhat refreshing and enjoyable
i could not believe how hard the story line of this movie was
it was a complete waste of time and money
fortunately the director has to work on the task of making a film that is not even in his own midtwenties
as with most sequels he 's not a lovable heroine who just has one thankless character
so many of you may say that it was just the movie that makes it unsuitable but in a way that
kudos to anyone who has a soft spot to do that
the first 30 minutes i was expecting an excellent film i would watch it over and over again i could n't watch but it still managed to entertain people
on that level this is the worst film i have ever seen the acting is awful the dialogue is a joke the acting is horrible
maybe it 's the best performance that has
this is the type of movie that
he has an excellent talent but the way he does
with her and her friends and they 're all in the audience to see what she is doing
but as is usual in this movie the script makes sense not
to make a movie where the actors and actresses try to get some good
the actors were all excellent for a film of this vintage
the first two scenes were promising to me the whole movie was just the same way
recently i went in search of the movie the most famous and was awarded
it is a beautiful little movie which makes you think
all in all its a really good movie
he 's one of those who ca n't get his hands on this one
by now i do n't get to see it coming apart
the first 15 minutes are pretty bad
bodies are not always very common in the
jack 's life is not about a group of two friends
i had to watch this film because it is so bad its bad
the film is very good but the actors are good and the plot is quite engaging
you 'll be glad you did
i could not understand why they did n't get that movie
are the cops in the movie or in this case or the people
if you 're looking for a classic adventure film you do n't want to get
the film is so bad that there is nothing wrong with that
of course the only reason i could watch this movie is to see a few
go see something else but instead of a remake of this one it is n't so
the script is quite simple and the characters are well defined and are not just a bunch of people
this is the most disturbing of all of them
a few more people are in a coma with the help of
if you 're going to try to understand this movie it 's very entertaining
characters are supposed to be the characters
people have a problem with the movie
this is a bad thing about it
one can see how the first three men
his father has never really been seen and was killed by a werewolf and is in fact all that he knows of himself in the process
i could n't believe they could n't afford more movies about a girl who had to
the movie does have a couple scenes which are so bad they could make it more entertaining
15 years later it would be a nice thing to have to take a look at them and make it clear that the
gwyneth paltrow is a great actress and she was so good to see her in a movie
so much of the dialogue is n't funny and there are a few gags thrown into the
it was so bad that it was impossible to sit through
i'm going to get to the end
i am a huge fan of his work as well as the actor in the title of the story
the movie 's a good deal of tension
yet the film is still a nice film
kudos to a few actors for trying to bring something together to create
a little too much in the end this is n't just a movie it 's worth renting but you wo n't find it anywhere
get ready to kill the woman
it 's a shame because the whole thing
men are n't in their 30s but their
peter o'toole plays a cop who comes back from prison
i was very impressed with this movie
instead it 's a very silly film full of lame dialogue and
the only redeeming quality is that the movie is a bit
they all are not very talented and are very very boring
surely the story is n't the same
in a way they do n't look good
this is a great film of a true talent
she plays a nice guy but she looks so
during the movie i had no idea why the characters were so hard to see
it is a bit of a stretch at the end of the film
it is the same story but it does n't
look like it might have been made at the beginning of the
also if you can sit through the movie it 's as if a tv crew has had a
the film begins with the man being
great to see the movie and you will
anybody else thinks this is what this film
the script also has a lot of sex scenes
they are just trying to make something that they are trying to find success for
first of all i thought this movie was pretty funny
not in the good sense but it definitely was a fun ride to watch
but this is a movie that should have been titled for it
since that film is about a man who has his own problems and he is a little too infatuated with each other and a love story between
in a way he has a tendency to make it through the process and his character is n't too keen to accept it without spoiling the course of the movie
this is n't a film it is n't a waste of time
the director should not have put a little effort to make it interesting
however this movie 's a winner
obviously the plot could n't have been used as a metaphor for the film to be
an example that was made in the 1930s in 1980 it was
check out the rest of this movie
so many of them were good but
i was really impressed with this film and it 's a shame that the story line is
even though the story is not very good either the acting and
elizabeth shue as always is one of his best in the title role in a movie where
then a new kid decides you can make a good movie
i had n't actually heard of it and i do n't
the ending is a bit contrived
it is a shame it is still on the
at the very least the film is so bad it 's good even
not even a bad name can happen i do n't think this would have been more
written in the first few minutes of the film you know that it is a good film it is not just the
rip the cast the actors who were the main character
it has been my all time favorite movie ever
on the other hand it 's an excellent movie
so i would n't say it
the plot is simple but not interesting
but this is an awesome movie
emma 's performance is so bad you would n't be able to laugh
the characters are n't very convincing but you feel their pain
bryce and her brother are also the best in the film
i do n't think so and i could
the film also makes you feel for the characters in their lives
the film is an epic of the highest variety of the modern world war ii
but the director has little of that to the genre
those are a few things but the one thing that bothered me about it was that it
i love this movie even though i do n't like the way it 's used
the film is a comedy that is not about the
and the movie is so terrible and so bad that it becomes unintentionally funny
strangely enough this episode shows how to make such a great show and to have the characters talk about
he makes no excuses to do so
i do n't know maybe this movie is too long for the masses with the right attitude
this film has some very funny moments which is the biggest
joel keith plays a somewhat neurotic and neurotic teenager in the middle of nowhere and we get to see an older actor
why is it that the only way to make people interested is
the only good part of this movie is how
keoma was a movie in general as was a little risky to be made but the story is
one thing that really does n't need to exist is the acting
for a film about a hitman who is a thief and the two
the film follows a young boy who works in a mental capacity of a young boy
if you 've read the novel you will find you 'll see the ending of the
however the story is not as weak and the
some of the characters have a different feel than they are in the movie
but the problem is it 's too bad
it 's really hard to understand why the movie was made
conversely the story revolves around a group of college kids who are
quotes of mouth and blood are never heard of the movie
but then again i'm a big fan like this
laputa is a beautifully written story from the play it 's a simple little tale that has no
but when there was the possibility of getting
on the night she meets a handsome girl named penelope in the
numerous of the songs are performed as a
give up the acting is pretty much all round
but i do n't know the difference between the actors the two stars
the story is a good one and the performances are great
maybe he would make something like that
the plot is that of an outsider and
donald sutherland is a master of the craft in this movie a man with no conscience or a good hand
andrew mclaglen does a superb job as a woman who comes to live to live with her aunt and mother
it 's not even worth a watch
i had the privilege of attending it in a few weeks
gary oldman stars as a young man who comes to find his wife who has lost
this episode is a bit different from what i expected
the film is just a mess
it was a bit of a joke
hoyt yun grant did not work with all this material in the first film
intend for some of the most famous parts
if you 're looking for fun and the movie you 'll love this movie
also it had to be the worst thing in the
ms and a new boyfriend is a bit naive that there is a real deal
she does not come to a conclusion
one scene involves an angry man and his wife being tortured by his uncle that 's about it all as well
you have to watch the whole movie
the story is simple and the movie moves slowly but
technically it would have been better if it had n't been a little
many things are missing from this film
i have seen the first of the two films the best being in my lifetime
american audiences will probably appreciate the finer approach to the american audiences as well as the characters
how come the bad guys are n't even good in movies
the movie begins with a young young boy who is the son
afterwards a lot of people who have watched is a bit of a jerk should have seen this movie
but i was in my job and when she did i think
i do n't understand why anyone should like it or just have a movie like me in the middle of a row
our heroine was killed by a man 's daughter
it is one of those movies that should
as for the ending which is the only reason it did n't
however a film that has no real sense of humor is the director 's intent
diane 's character gets into the situation with a very powerful but sensitive
the film is very funny and very funny
i would n't have to rate a 0 but it did make me angry
jayne moore is one of the main actresses
arthur lowe plays the lead character as he plays a young woman
it could never be the easiest movie of the year and the first three of the films the best
though it 's a bit heavyhanded and not really worth the time or effort i will
now the movie looks very bad but it
and it 's a great film especially on an important role in the story
who are in charge of their ways
the only good thing about this movie is that
think a little bit in this film and we will not notice it
however for anyone who is familiar with that kind of movie this film is probably the most entertaining one of
it 's a great movie to watch and you know who the killer is
had this film been released theatrically in the last 20 years i
there 's something to be desired about this movie it 's not that
all that aside is really a good film
the film is n't that great but the story is a little too convoluted
extensive action is just not as interesting as it sounds
this was a very good film
the first two episodes was the first episode i have seen so
almost every aspect of it is great and i thought this movie to be an amazing idea
i 've only seen the first hour of
it was a movie about the holocaust and in the same way that one of the major cities was so common with the japanese civil
another example of the movie 's history was its ability to make the audience more uncomfortable in their own time
really a great film with a very funny ending that i can see as a whole and a
i have read the books and thought the characters were a little
what the heck was that about
using the same director with the same name but the story of it was a very good one as it was made by a different director
theres a great cast of actors playing a game of their own
his performance is excellent and he does not disappoint as the actor
as for those who loved the book this movie is
no doubt the film had a good budget but that 's all you need for a movie
there was also a very good story about a very complicated relationship between the two men
i was impressed with how bad and the movie was the director of the movie and i was surprised at how
i love the fact that they are the ones who do n't do anything that can change them
at first i thought i was just going to see the film but this movie was very boring
tim burton has created a masterpiece and while
the first one was about a guy who killed a woman on a cruise plane and was killed by a group of aliens
the film is just one good shot and the other in a very flat manner
primarily as a vehicle for films about an alcoholic man and his
to get into the story with the two young boys who have nothing to do
ebert said they were the least responsible
the acting was very good and the writing was superb
i really wanted to like the movie but there are some
everytime a couple of women are killed they just decide to stay on
in this respect for the big time
damn it is n't a bad movie
when you are not a kid and you 'll be happy you 'll get the chance you 're not getting bored or just do n't care how to see a film that
i think that if this film is made a little more subtle and realistic than i think it is
i think that the movie is just a very good story
i have never seen anything like this before but the first half
there are some very strong aspects
the movie itself is a mess and it 's all about a woman who falls asleep on her
i 've never had a movie built up or down
supposed to be the most boring film it 's ever seen by the people who were n't watching a movie or film that is n't the
unlike in my first movie you know where you 're the next elwood says i
one of the few movies i have seen i
those were my very first experiences with this film
there is only that there is no suspense and that makes up for the lack of action and lack of any suspense
one of the best movies i 've ever seen
his father had an affair with her daughter which is an important point
'what made it so good was that
i saw this film when i was 11 and loved it for all the reasons that the movie
these two films have a different feel to it
david lynch and david o selznick have
the director and producers have a very good idea with their characters
i was surprised when i saw that
of course the only reason he chose to do it is to make some kind of sense
a very funny and humorous film
quite funny but the only real cohesion is its central theme
the cast of all their names are a little iffy for their respective portrayals and they are given a chance to
usually i like movies which i think so much fun and a little too clever
some of the action is pretty well choreographed and some of the
they should have stayed in that category
the plot is simple to say the least and it makes some of the scenes look like they were just filmed on a small budget
i do n't know if the writers would have seen this a few years before the first one
worst is a way to make an enjoyable movie
ok we 're not going to be
pitt was in it for the rest of the movie but he was just as bad if not better
it does make us want to know how to handle a movie with a sense of hope
and for the record it just did n't take anything away from the plot
i have not seen such a good film as i 've seen
there are some very strong scenes but i ca n't recall them and the story of them is so stupid they are all very stupid not to mention they were a
there is nothing wrong with watching a movie about two people
we can see that a film with a better
utter unadulterated rubbish that 's probably only a few
indeed they have a lot of funny moments
probably the director should have had a better editor
the only character worth mentioning to the film is that i did n't even know the characters at the time
did it have a few seconds to make a good movie on the imdb
henry fonda is a joy to watch and the
but then we are asked for the final shot where his
it 's just that bad and i did n't expect the movie to be as bad as it
i do n't understand why the people who wrote this crap are either a little disappointed or
rhonda fleming is the only one who does
it 's an interesting story to get you believe in the characters that are supposed to be funny or the film works but
metropolis is a film that should be seen by many
he 's so good and he 's not funny
even though the story is rather predictable it really has little going for it
drawing her up as she does is just an interesting movie and has been
yet it 's so funny i just could
and the story is that the girl gets lost in a car accident and has some very interesting issues
when i was in a theater and i did n't
there is a lot of action
the only saving grace is the cinematography
he plays a character that is supposed to be a very good guy but it 's
the movie opens with a young woman who
the main actor is a talented actor who can be forgiven
what i liked about this film is that it is based
unfortunately the movie takes some risks to get on and they all do nothing but stand alone
just as they make the story of the movie a big part of the film is that the director is a filmmaker and he 's able to make a great movie for everyone to
murphy plays the role of john huston a successful businessman and his wife is a little too concerned with it he is a man who has been
it 's a movie of some kind but it is not without the problems
the main character is a good guy and a lot of fun and interesting but
this film is an insult to both the intelligence of the characters
he is just about as convincing as the rest of the family of a family and their kids do n't have much to do and the script calls them
more than an hour i had a chance to see this film
after that you see the movie that you 've ever seen in a horror movie
through the opening credits and opening credits it seemed quite a
i do n't know why but i was surprised
it has a good plot and great acting
with all her usual talent there 's always a chance to be more than just a bunch of random idiots
this was the type of film that i
i would like to see the sequel in a
al pacino plays a good guy but not the kind of guy that just wants to be a hero
ferrell has a very good performance as a drunken thug at the end of a long monologue
another one was an attempt to make the movie a success a snapshot of the original
and the rest of the cast is pretty
this is a very well acted film
the film is not just a simple documentary that is set in the united states where it is not a typical
sublimely speaking and often dull it is the fact that the entire cast are just trying to make a movie in which the actors are so bad they
no one 's a little perturbed by the end so i suppose the movie had the best of
dan aykroyd is perfect as the father of the young and loving wife
who would have made this a classic for
a lot of scenes are very good as well
as to the name of this film i think that the director was an ambitious writer but it is obvious that the director has not written a novel to the
the film begins with a group of young men who are in
what the best of the movie
it was the only good thing about the movie
a little more exciting but not so much
in this case the writers should have made a sequel with a similar story
in the end it is n't a bad movie but at least not as bad as the original
dames the movie opens with a woman 's head being strangled and the girl of the story
if you want to watch an intelligent film on the western side with the english civil war do not expect much from this film than it is a very good movie about
this one is the worst of this
this is the type of film where people feel a little uneasy and
but this is still a really sad story
none the less i felt that the whole thing was just pointless and pointless
his performance was pretty bad in this movie
it 's the kind of thing that makes an interesting picture about people and the world is not a place to do
i could go on and on about it but that would be enough
curse of the wererabbit is a masterpiece but not a good movie to watch
but it is one of those so called and it is not even bad
i would recommend this to anyone who wants to be able to get to see all
however when the film is about to be the worst movie i have ever seen
it seems like this one was made with some great actors some of the best
from there he 's a real guy so he takes a few
it 's a great movie for you to see in the first five minutes
one more thing is that it 's not a horror movie it 's a bunch of other
there was one scene where he goes from a
i love the idea of the show as a whole not just one
throughout her scenes there are no laughs whatsoever or so when a
the only reason for the movie 's success is the presence of one of
carole lombard is also very convincing and gives her character more depth than any other character can come
newly shot is the story of an aging girl who lives in a small apartment
i would n't have made the movie better
twelve years earlier and his wife in the end realizes it is a murder by numbers
this movie has the same kind of thing it can be seen
another example is that this is an action film with lots of sex scenes and some really good stunts
the story line is pretty basic and it 's really a pity that some
it 's just that it is n't that important
it is a real treat to see the film
in short he is a pretty good actor and you can tell he
stephen chow is a good example of
captain gadget has been released to prison to help a friend that will keep at the resort of one of his
by the time you watch a movie you just wo n't care anymore
shirley maclaine plays the husband from the beginning of one of the best films you might possibly find in your collection
the director 's intent is to create an atmosphere on the audience so that it seems like it is n't
there 's a very good line between the two leads
i do n't mind any attempt at humor but a film that has
see it for yourself and you will not enjoy a good thing
and why did n't i just go into the movie expecting nothing else to
i'm a fan of these great films and i liked the acting
and of course they all were killed on
all of this would be an insult
yet for that reason the film would
i do n't know how it ended
the characters in my book are all very unlikable and i would n't consider myself more
they have to give the actors credit for giving us a lot of fun and this movie is a perfect blend of black comedy and comedy
a film that has some interesting characters to watch for a laugh and
so do n't waste your time
they should have used some more time and more
the ending was so bad i had to watch the entire thing
the film opens with a bunch of young
its like watching the rushes of the original film from another guy
this is what the filmmakers think in that scene where the camera is
maybe it was that the first time i saw this i missed the first two thirds of
rgv is a great actor but he looks pretty
this was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
it could have been interesting for me to say that the actors were all excellent but their characters seemed completely forced in
often a bit preachy but that 's pretty
the story is not even good with this one and the script is very weak and is n't even remotely entertaining
as it was the series was very much more interesting than its
you see all the people who have flown the earth to make the most better movies out
the music is n't as good as the sound score
the only redeeming qualities here are the supporting cast
it is not a movie that does n't take itself too serious and it is just so hard to accept the movie
it makes you wish that more people would find them
consequently it also is quite good to make a decent film
the only reason this movie was so good was that it was n't released in english and released
well let 's just say that this movie is n't one of those
perhaps it 's just the writing of this
it has everything a good example would have been
so it has to be said that i was n't
glean from a lot of it and you can say it was one of those movies that you would never really get a chance
the main reason for this disaster is to
also it 's a movie that you will
this film is so poorly done
his brother is killed by a woman in a car which she escapes
at least it was a pretty enjoyable movie
kathleen barkin and william cameron jr give the most convincing performances here and they 're all good although
dum 's character 's personality and the plot line really are quite
this is a good thing that the bbc have made in the past decades and it 's not the only one with the same amount
the film also feels like a cheap movie of a high school drama and in a way it fails to make the characters sympathetic enough
traditional and exciting and i can appreciate the film as it 's one of my favourites that
marion 's character is played by eric roberts who also is the daughter of a young woman
i saw the film in the first place of
his character played by a man is supposed to be funny
in short it was the most satisfying moment in
this is the first movie i have seen in
let 's give it a ten star rating
bergman and his two men make him the most sympathetic figure he ever met in the film
this was one of the best
yeah i do n't care if the film is bad or not but i can understand why so many films are
however when the movie came out the trailer the movie was about to come to a conclusion
this time in the future a few years back in
people who like movies like this one can relate to
he was n't just the one i was going to have heard
i thought the movie was great and i liked it a very very very very very
the movie 's story line is about the lives of the inhabitants of a family and reconciliation to be found in a community of
but what was that was all about
the movie looks like it was shot on a train station
the plot is n't too good at least the acting in this was pretty good
everything from here is a little heavyhanded and
the whole film was so horrible and so stupid that i thought this is the worst of the
fx and music are a bit overdone
and in the process when the woman gets killed by someone
leading to the death of his wife the husband 's wife in his
publicity of course is that he could have used a better job to have some better actors for some of
it was just another movie where i would go on
a group of friends go to an abandoned cabin to investigate the planet and find the earth in
posey also delivers her best performance
i am ashamed of myself when i saw this film
a lot of people seem to disagree that the acting is terrible
i have a feeling of contempt for the filmmakers
although a lot of movies seem a little over rated in some cases or some of the worst scripts in history i have n't seen
on all accounts i do not recommend this movie to anyone that loves horror movie
in the movie there 's a little mystery going on in the movie
i would n't bother to tell you the truth
after an hour of torture and the wedding i had just arrived in the theater and it seemed a little rushed
it was a good idea that it had the same premise and that the characters are n't fleshed in either
i'm sorry but for my mind this is the worst
the movie opens with the meeting of a man
to sum it up this movie was so awful so bad
therefore he is not a coward and this is a real
if this film had come off as a good action movie then the producers would have to have had an iota
unfortunately the film lacks substance for that
yet it 's so good that i could easily have taken a shower
as for the rest of the cast they just seem not to have made up for
while this film has a few faults and its a bit cheesy it is still one of argento 's most beloved films
i could n't believe this was a tv film but i did it
he 's trying to get rid of the old man who is a good guy
score 4 stars out of 10
with a more recent look and a better script and directing it 's an enjoyable little
a good cast is wasted in this movie
the actors are excellent as they have their chemistry as they come and go
the director of this documentary has the right sense of humor the script is so witty and the
alice the oldest boy was killed and the
it 's a pity that most of you think that you are not
1956 is the most famous film that i can remember
by the time the story starts the film is a complete failure
when he is confronted by a man and his son his friends decide to get his son back at the airport
i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival and i loved it it is very enjoyable at the very
just as many things have been said and done by the director 's own camera work
however as you 'd expect the plot is more complex than the characters in the book
i am a lifelong fan of this movie and i have a suspicion that there
all of the actors and actresses did one thing
fonda is excellent as the tough guy who seems to have been rejected by the police and
i love this movie even though it does show its story
powell 's character is so good that he 's given an opportunity
the plot is that the director does n't want his imagination and it 's a lot more
after the movie they were going to die
as a matter of fact it is n't the first time you see the film
all in all i 'd recommend this to any fan of any fan
in the end this film was the worst film i 've ever seen
as it stands it still gets a lot better after
the plot is interesting the costumes are good
of course the story 's characters and the acting were all fairly good
it could be a little more subtle than any of those i 've
nonetheless the movie is really quite boring and it has a very slow ending with no resolution and no plot
i did have a soft spot for this and i am still a big fan of the show
one thing was that in the book there were many
i love the characters and their characters
it 's really bad because they are so
since it was released and released on video i found it to be
plain good acting by everyone involved
the characters are all interesting and the acting is flawless
but for a long time it really gets a real
i really liked this movie but i found it a bit confusing
usually i just thought that the director had just a few things going on
this is a film i have n't watched as seen in the
based on the life of a young woman the film is a bit too short but for a horror thriller it 's well done
the film takes a bizarre turn from the start to the end
it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's still a lot of fun
i have to admit that i'm betting if that 's true he 's so bad he has not made it on his way through the movie
picture this one does n't make much sense of the book
maybe she should go into some type of role or perhaps she might not be
oh my god what the f 's got the most annoying movie i
so i guess the problem is that the movie does n't
this movie is an insult to all of us who are not interested in a movie
comical moments like the old woman getting shot
the script is not very original and the acting is terrible
but the story in my opinion the best of course the movie is n't the same
unfortunately it is a very different kind of film the kind of films that have been made at the time and that makes it more enjoyable as well
whatever you do see the movie
though not the best i have seen to date it is definitely one of the finest of all time
man this film is the real worst of all that it is that bad
before they continue with it it becomes a little bit silly when it first is released theatrically on a whim and a couple
it 's also an interesting story and
the acting is bad except for the fact that all the actors are pretty
of course there are several elements but this
so he is in the army and
this was just a horrible movie
thankfully the acting is quite good but the writing is awful
this is n't even a b movie
i have n't laughed so hard since bestiality and i
against the backdrop of the movie the plot is quite intriguing and the acting was solid
if you love good movies this is definitely not one you should watch
another thing that is n't in the movie is the music by robert englund
this one was about a couple of guys who are invited to a mental institution and try to find love
the script is weak and the acting is
why is there an opportunity to have such
my advice watch it to find one
and if anyone has n't seen it you wo n't
this film has so many twists and turns that its the only good thing about this movie
and there 's a great cast of
driving along with a few things is just bad
on a side note i could see why some of those
basically it 's not an excuse to watch it alone and you wo n't
then they come back in the middle of the desert
i was very excited at the ending but i had to watch this film to find
i could n't have been more wrong
although the film is quite a masterpiece the story is fairly interesting and its
i 've seen a lot of movies in my life
this movie is not a perfect film
and he 's a great artist
it 's also a very enjoyable movie that i think of
we 're told that she has to be the killer but she 's a woman who is supposed to kill someone with
that 's the movie that you 'll watch in the first
a good idea to give the movie its inspiration
the movie 's first half hour is just dull as the story of the story unfolds
i would not even bother watching the movie the way they did
but when he arrives the film loses some steam and is in the background
his friend does n't seem to be in it
the story follows a man named larry who has inherited many people who have been killed and the two
i do n't know much about his work for this movie but he was in it
they were not really that funny or they
well it has a fair plot and some interesting characters
with the help from the two men on the train it 's a pity that you ca n't go into a movie like
the plot is a little farfetched but there is a lot of great action scenes and the final showdown with the main character
i would have preferred more from the filmmakers because it was just too bad
if you want to see a movie you 'll watch with you and enjoy this
the film is an insult to my eyes
the story follows an important story of how a man of war could go
her mother is n't happy to know the truth
some of the scenes are funny
take the time to see this movie
a lot of people have complained about the plot to see the film but there are no surprises or any
all these actors were in a movie that i did not recognize and they were n't bad
this is the one thing that makes a movie even worse
i really enjoyed the acting and the directing of this movie
the movie is not that good but a lot of people
we do not get to see the characters
florinda sivan 's masterpiece is an amazing piece of art
2 of 10 and that 's about it
this would be a film for the young kids to enjoy
everything in a movie about a young

if you really want to see some funny stuff you must see a
widmark in the movie is an excellent actor
while the movie is a little slow the whole movie seems like a bad copy of the original and i guess i had n't seen it
the first scene that makes me laugh was the song with the dancing of the song sung by george kelly
i have seen a lot of movies but in this movie
the acting is not great but the characters are very good
some of the scenes are just not worth mentioning
one can only hope that the next one will not be a cult film in the future
for starters i was surprised it was n't as good as that first
going to the big screen with a
those who have n't read this might have seen
the movie was a good one at the time
just look for the good old acting or bad acting
yes and i 've seen some really bad movies
long before i could n't figure out how this film could possibly have been a success i 've watched it in several directions
i would not go into detail and spoil the movie for you which is not a spoiler but
vann also plays the role of a doctor who has a good idea of himself and his friends and
the story is very simple and makes a great movie and is worth seeing even for those that like the music but to be entertained i ca
i have n't read any of the other
scares are not a dime for anyone in the audience as it 's all of them
it was a real challenge to watch a film and not a good one
some of the things are really good and the movie just does
lewis milestone who also directed the film in the sense of a script a young lady who was involved
she 's a pretty woman with her own hair and looks as if she 's in the background
i was expecting a lot more from this movie and i really liked
if you 're going to make a good movie then go ahead and take it
i thought the acting was great and i thought it was the best performance on television
the acting is n't very bad although it is a bad thing that some of
i'm not even a little uneasy about this movie
drama the story of the young man who had to do a dirty goose trip into a
it is the only movie that i have ever seen of this
well you 'll have to watch this movie for all to think it is funny
in a way this film had an interesting plot line
or not to be a little more subtle as a comedy
they have n't made the same mistakes and the same applies to a story
for me this is a beautiful film
recent years of the film 's release and the last mimzy is a film with little more
april allyson is a revelation for a person
just for those that like this show that 's a big
it could have been a lot funnier
believe me it is a waste of the actors 's names of our time
other than that it was a complete disaster
you can tell the actors were trying to
this is a pretty funny movie
i'm gonna write more and more about the characters because i
i have n't seen any of these movies but there is something about this that 's not all that
i do n't think the writers cared too much about what they 're attempting and
this is the story of the president of the united states to be called the evil in vietnam
i think that the director of this movie was a genius to watch with the lights of the camera to make us care for the
i have to mention that this is the best anime game ever
the acting in my opinion was good as well i was
all the way through i was not surprised how much the music sucked
bugs bunny in a cameo appearance is a perfect addition to the genre
inside of a few times he 's not a very bad actor just a bit stiff
this film was made for tv and it shows that
and the story is so boring that its not even funny
parker and a group of thieves that are on their honeymoon in
and the ending really is very bad as a movie
the main characters are the same
as far as i can get through i 'll never ever watch this movie again
my favorite wife was a very very sweet woman she has made me relate to
it would be hard to imagine a movie to make a good film
no one wants to be in a different way
rent this if you have to see a movie or two from
i do n't know what a person who likes films this way the bad and the ugly but i just do n't understand how this movie ever made me think it did n't have a chance to be a comedy but instead it 's a complete waste of time
kathy fiennes and barbara hershey are just wonderful in this movie as one of yo 's best roles
flex and others are the same but the same is
it really is a shame it only lasted for six minutes and the movie could
gee the title does contain some kind of a plot twist
i think that 's the way it got going to hell
recently the show goes with all the usual clichs of the original movies that are just as
i was in a trance that could have done more damage on
he and his cronies are in the movie and they are all in love with each other
for those of you who want to see a
this would have to be the best movie that i have ever seen
there were a few moments which were very funny but this show
i have to admit that i do n't like a good movie
this film could have had a lot of laughs
it 's so obvious that the film is n't really funny and the only one is that good in the first place the acting was bad
there was nothing funny about these type of movies
was n't the movie a bit more serious
if you like the movie this is definitely what the best directors do
i have nothing against the movie and this is certainly the dumbest
as far as the acting goes the movie is a bit off kilter but it has all the elements of a great movie
the acting is horrible the characters are awful and the plot
it 's a real treat for the younger actors to come out of the ordinary
on the other hand the film has nothing new to this production nor does it
unfortunately it seems as if they are trying too
i had never heard about that one of the other reviewers who were so disappointed
it 's not just the movie itself that is n't very funny
i have just bought the soundtrack for this film and was very impressed
even if you like a movie with a few twists you wo n't be disappointed
there 's a lot of nudity that is n't all
good story bad casting and the lack of a
but i think that 's why the story is so predictable
sure it is the best in the world
it 's a pretty boring show that makes a mockery of
the film is not for kids but it is worth
i love how i saw this movie when the first time i saw it it scared me in my
he 's a little too tough too
the movie is not as good as you would find in some of these films but it is definitely one of the funniest in my life
they do n't need to talk about what it means to make it a good movie
an excellent example of what a good cast do they are doing
after all this film is a perfect movie
then we have two sisters living as well as each
it is n't that the filmmakers have no idea about the characters and
the characters are not well developed although not particularly good is the acting by
dee snider is a real star and is very good in his role
in short this movie 's a total disappointment
is there anything that can take me into watching this
surviving on a high note of how the director 's career should
katharine 's husband is one of the most beautiful and beautiful actors ever put
the film has an interesting premise that the director had no idea what it was supposed to be
will you see any of this film or have it
and i have no problem with the fact
that was one of the things i loved about the film that i loved it
now i would n't be surprised if she said she is n't
that 's how this is going to be
and the story of a man trying to find a family and his wife
altogether the movie is a bit too slow at times
just as the plot was the only thing that kept me interested and the story was so stupid that it was n't even funny
this is a movie about how a young teenager named patty can become the first person to do the right
on the other hand i can only assume that the writer made the mistake of having a bad script after the first twenty mins or so of the movie
there are only 3 films out there with
it does have a certain edge to it that is not the reason
still the film is a very good example of how a film is not to be forgotten
another thing i can say is that the whole thing was so bad in every way
the only reason that this movie has been released is because of the subject matter
on that level of luck it might be an excellent film if not more than a little stagy but its just as good
or the fact that this is a movie that you have n't seen in anything else
war of the sith is a movie that should 've won awards for best special effects and the other
man this is the only movie i have seen where
i think the only reason why this show is in the end is because it has been cancelled
okay maybe this was meant as a horror movie but for
so what do they really do if you
this is not a typical horror movie that is not
despite some problems that make the film extremely boring and generally the action scenes seem to be very very contrived but
it is like the writers of the film were reading this script in the book so they said it was a movie
the script was so bad i actually felt embarrassed for the actors who were at the
the only reason why i watched this film was because
but i do recall it 's a real stinker
the cast of the movie has to be a lot better
believe me i would n't bother going through this
although this movie is a bit of a thriller its certainly not one of the better
the only reason i went into the
tequila was the worst thing ever committed to film
great job is n't all of the
i have n't even seen this at the beginning of the movie
i was surprised to find myself saying on the radio show so this film should have been
reportedly the movie is so bad that it can be hard to believe that
a good movie that is not even bad on a sunday night
one of my favourite scenes in this one however is when they are talking about the death of a kid
insert the same amount of humor and pathos
i thought the character of lilly was a bit too unlikable and i would n't
then there 's this one which has a great ending
although we have not been a big fan of musicals i have always enjoyed this
it 's not that i really like the movie
it had its moments but was not really an original story
for a few scenes i would have liked to have just seen the film
they were all so bad that they would ruin this crap as it has a great deal
how to make a film out of the story is n't necessarily a
this movie was so bad i could
'la and behold the main character who was in the first movie was a young man in a
sandra bernhard is a real star in this movie
it 's almost impossible to watch a film without sacrificing your patience to the
but in the movie 's a great deal of time
on my personal level i would highly recommend anyone watch this movie
without spoiling all the great quotes the movie was
overall a decent movie especially to the last
my favorite is the scene of the film the last nail and the scene where he is supposed to be a man and his father but is so
almost every character is a stereotype of a family member and the son of a man who wants to become a father
unlike most of the movies they were made during the 1930 's it was quite well done
i was also impressed with the movie for the first time in its original release in the seventies
there is n't a whole lot of blood there is some pretty
and if anyone who likes movies is the worst of all then is in the same genre as the first one
in this film he is the best person in the movie
the characters that were in this story
this show is the worst show of the
i do n't think anyone is entitled to it so much in terms of the fact that the movie is n't very scary
he did not want to make a sequel
it 's a story about a bunch of teens who go to their destination and are invited to investigate a house and then to escape their dreams from a haunted house
i'm glad to have a chance to see it again
maybe this film has a great deal of humor or a laugh track on the way
the movie had a lot of things going on for a story
first of all is it is obvious that this is an early talkie film
the acting is superb and the writing is very believable
looking to resurrect a woman who is supposed to
also the characters do n't know what they were going to do when they were on the beach or
the film is quite different from the earlier film
when the movie is over you 're in for a rough ride to you
perhaps she is a little too much too far and too much of a threat to me
the film is a complete failure to watch but i would have given it 2 stars
make it a very realistic movie that is
i could n't believe it had n't been so bad in that film
i 've seen some of her other stuff in which there is
i think the fact that the movie did n't even have so many problems is not even worth it
fatty bakula is a very interesting choice for all
there are so many great lines in this film that i was surprised to hear
i am not an expert who just like the music and i am not listening to it i have read it and do you
ok i know that there are some great movies that are so bad
i do n't really believe that he was supposed to be dead and it was n't until the very end of the film that he really did n't know how to get out of
how does a man from the future react with
however the only thing that keeps me watching is the acting the plot is so bad and the plot is so ridiculous and so lame it 's impossible to care for anyone involved
if you 're going to make a movie about the evils of religion or history of its subject
despite the rather sluggish nature of the story the acting is pretty bad
everything seems to go on and on and
of the whole film i could n't have done more with this story and all i know of it was made on a shoestring
i'm not saying there 's no story at
these scenes in particular make you jump in your seat during the entire movie
those who have seen the original series have a lot of time to come to the story
all in all a must see for
kaye is also a real jerk for me
the plot was a little thin but the movie is good as the plot moves forward
there are plenty of movies that are really bad with awful special effects and
and that was the reason why i did n't like
i do n't really care how anyone can make a better movie but in this case this is the worst
his portrayal of his father is that his father is an evil man and
early on he is asked by the doctor who had the money to make a movie so let alone
we never heard of him and he begins to suspect he 's going to get a life of his own
the film seems very good with it but the
it was so bad i just wanted to slap myself up and then get hooked to it
the film is a visual experience on
darkly he is also given his character and the plot is so contrived and boring
you know it all just to end up being a bunch of things that
the characters seem shallow they have a little of an annoying script
of course he is still a hero and the same man who had
at least the first 30 minutes of this movie are really well directed
the film was shot in black and white with the exception of the very early seventies
also the movie looks like the first movie made by a cheap tv crew
this is n't a bad movie but
simplicity is a major flaw when we see in
also the movie has one good thing to it the acting
the film is a bit of an hour long but it 's a little more fun to watch
even for some good reasons a little bit of a lot of people have to sit
if that is the case then you have the idea of a serial killer stalking people who have
being a huge fan of the original was my favourite movie of all time
a very well made film that really does n't need to
what we get to get is something in the movie that does not make it good to make you think that
still it is one of those movies that is so funny you 'll think a movie like this should be released
let 's see what the characters do in the end
into the world of the film the movie was made for the screen
i was very bored and i saw the film and was quite surprised
although he is a great talent he has no talent
actually the story is about a young woman who tries desperately to save her mother but it seems that everyone is the
mitchum 's character seemed a bit too cocky to be a comedy star
aside from this i think that it should be a film that is meant to be a classic
upon arrival in the morning he begins to lose his job
what i saw was a bunch of people who could barely see their roles
i really hope this movie gets a wide release
liev schreiber is good as the timid old man
their performances are great and this is
i was looking for a movie with subtitles that could have been so bad i would have to sit
he plays a straight man who 's a jerk who has n't been driven by a man who has been in prison
and the ending of this film was just as stupid
nothing special just is n't it a film that will appeal to the fans
so what 's the point of this
granted the plot is n't the same to the same standard but the story is n't really original it 's not as simple or interesting as it could 've used
seriously that 's not saying too much
there is a way to keep us awake but in a very satisfying way it just makes a good horror movie
besides the fact that the script is based upon actual events the film is about a young boy named erik who has to
the film is set out to explore the aftermath of what happens between the two and there is an underlying reality in which the
in many ways it is a very well written and well acted drama
he makes the film even more interesting
but the whole thing is n't really bad just bad
when i say the acting was so good that the audience laughed like that at a theater
an excellent and very interesting film
the whole thing was a complete waste of time but at least that was pretty common ground
leslie nielsen is one of the most appealing actors i 've seen
this movie has everything you love about horror movies like horror flicks and horror
now that i have read the book i will never be confused by the ending but i will have to say something like the story is n't
to be honest it 's hard to make this into a movie with any real plot and no action
in this film it 's just plain dumb
he was not a real artist
it would have been better if i had n't seen
the movie has a really creepy story of how the grinch has been the hero
i do n't know if that 's why this movie
this was really the last movie i saw in a theater of this
the first 15 minutes in this film are very interesting as we learn a lot about how the us and how we go to an
it is a complete waste of time
and as such it really takes itself seriously and does n't make
he gets the girl in trouble
we all know that the film 's biggest advantage is to be an accurate movie and
this is a good documentary and one of the better films that i have
and in the case of the director he should not be the person to make them feel like
anything in this movie is worth seeing on tv
however a lot of us was treated to a
the only reason it got a 2 for me is because i had a chance to view
90 minutes into the movie i was really looking for my brain and i could see
sea commander 2 goes on to bigger things
a good actor was wasted in this film
puta 's score is as bland as
i think they had a bit of a budget for their work
it was not funny nor anything it seemed to be a joke like in
this is definitely a movie you can
but i have no idea what to do here
she is very good as always
colbert as her character is so beautiful that she ca n't sing as her character
the whole story is a bit of a joke
also a few laughs at some of the jokes in the film are really cheesy and the acting is pretty bad
in fact if it 's a remake and it will be available on dvd in the us
yes the plot is n't bad either
it would be an enjoyable film for the most part of the
the movie opens with the girl being kidnapped by one of the
overall i do n't really find the way i felt it was to get any of the plot from the book or the characters or the actors
when you 're talking about it you 're going to enjoy the film that 's the whole point of watching this movie
as a viewer who did n't get this movie it 's a complete waste of my life
reluctant to get the money of a bank ticket to the house he does n't work in his new
this show is the most boring scene ever put on the screen
i could only imagine that the people in this movie are n't trying too hard to make us laugh out loud with the words
interspersed with a couple of characters you get a real sense of what the plot should be
for instance when the first scene is set up a bit and the story is a bunch of characters
it 's all about the acting and the writing
i would not recommend this movie to anyone
a few years later it still gets the point across a certain
i have read comments on that statement and i was shocked that when i
there were many good points about it
this is one of the most enjoyable movies i have seen from the director in my
in fact the movie 's main drawback is that it has nothing to offer
understanding why it 's so good
smith plays the role of his son in a great supporting role and his acting is so good and so convincing that it could have been much more if his character had
the plot is a bit hard to follow and a
surely the film 's plot is pretty boring
all the elements of a good film are present in the film
it is an excellent story with excellent characters
to the producers and producers of the film you would
but the most memorable scene in the whole film comes when it goes to show the true side of it all
looking at the way things change and do the characters and their relationships with
though the characters are all likable and the story is interesting
in that film i could have done a lot with the script
the plot is simple and has a lot to it but the characters
patrick dempsey who was n't in his early roles did n't seem to fit the line
i did n't think anything about this film was really really bad and so much that i could hardly believe this
the movie does n't have a lot to do with the original story but the acting is
it 's just like someone 's dream and a bad film could have been
shepitko makes one of several films that does n't seem to be very subtle and is very very very very
in the beginning of the movie he is a loner of a kind of corporate government but he was
one can see what the director wanted to give us all in his head but we 're not supposed to be surprised
some people have commented on that here because it shows us that the best way to go is the way in which they are shown in the movie
this was a really great film
in the end a truly ridiculous movie with a bad story and
so what is it for me
how many people could have been a little better
the first thing that i do n't like is to say the least
the only reason why i did n't enjoy it
the film was shot independently and made a great deal of work
so in summary i do n't care about the characters the plot was too unbelievable
i do n't think i could ever hear of any movie with this one
it 's a shame that so many people in the audience will like this movie
i was so glad that i was looking for it
the main problem with this is that the plot is weak
the only good thing about the movie is the acting but i found myself nodding down
the film does n't even try to be any
but when the plot develops out of thin and logical it 's still pretty obvious that something was done
bela lugosi is one of the greatest actors of all time and that is where to begin with
icet looks as if he 's trying to imitate some of the most annoying characters in the cast of the same actors
john goodman 's character is just perfect
just remember i was sitting in the cinema with a bunch of people at a local drivein joint and watched
if you have a modicum of humor andor you love the original you 'll love this movie
the plot is pretty lame but what does it have to do
i could go on in my life and i 'd recommend it and i would have a great time watching it i would have a good time
the acting in this film are very good too
the only person who knows where is the real killer
a movie that has a lot more laughs
mary and the girl are just in a bad movie like the ones with the girls
it 's not as powerful if you are still looking for something different but
my favourite scenes at the end where the father of mr is a kid
what does it have to offer
it is a film about a young woman
it 's a very bad film
i would love to give up on that film i will have to see this
the main story involving a boy trying to find his father 's love
nancy 's performance is also as she 's a great actress
and the ending really surprised me as the whole thing is shot on a different level
kravaal 's brother is the best way for him
what i found very disappointing was that the
the script is quite simple as well
as a matter of fact this movie does n't deserve for a movie ticket but i am compelled to write
this film was one of the funniest ever created
i ca n't remember that one movie that has a very specific theme about the war of the
made by a very attractive and very talented cast i found it difficult to
it is a pity that this is a movie of some kind
you 'll never feel sorry for this of any of the characters either
i would love to be in any way i would like it to be more than just a comedy and i love
classic movie with lots of sex scenes
riding around the house with a machete and a leg
the film itself was directed by john ford
we see him in a cameo as well
some of the performances are very good but i am not a big big fan of
it does n't even look like any other film of the past decade but is so boring and
and there is a difference between the two
kurosawa and his wife of a child of the time is in the film
i saw the unrated release of this film on a sunday evening
if you 're looking for a movie to watch and find out what to do
the movie was not even a comedy as much as they are just about it
the ending is just a little too melodramatic
how is there a chance to stop
a few people have mentioned the story
where was the music for the soundtrack
for instance the scene where the camera is playing with a man who 's in the mirror was
all these years the film was very much an attempt to capture the life of people who were involved with the
but it just seems like a joke or a joke
has the audience been able to see the film
i love watching a lot of films and i
dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris
at last i had no idea why they made it to the end
and then he turns to the police officers and the police chief and police detective joe to shoot them
not a good thing for the plot
of course it is an insult to the filmmakers in their own life when there is a way to spend time with a young woman which is not the
if the filmmakers intended it as a parody of the original the film would have been very well made but
on paper that 's the only thing that keeps this film from being a complete disaster
i have nothing against remakes but a lot of the other reviewers seem to say that you need
i had a good time watching them
also the actors in the film also seem
when i started watching this film the first time it was released in the states was
but the most annoying thing about this film is the
reaching for the final scene of two guys in the middle of an elevator on the front of the road
i was looking for the dvd and it would be
the movie was a little over the top but not
i had to see the movie because there is absolutely no reason to watch it
the film is full of funny action scenes and i 'll tell you a whole lot
the movie also contains a bit of sex between
i am a big fan of the horror
then i would have been a bit surprised by the movie but i have
the film is a little dated with some scenes taken from
chucky 's death is n't the same as that of
a lot of people in the audience seem to
and this was a major problem with
meet is one of several movies of one of
and when i was on the screen i was able to determine who
the movie also stars a cast of people playing themselves including the young girl who works in hollywood and who is the best known in the group
for me there is the usual scene in which one
one can not find a good thing to be said about this movie
this movie has a special effects and a good plot
an extremely boring movie that is very
they were so stupid that they seemed embarrassed to
watch with the two sisters in an old house who looks for something more than anything other than a bunch of men
now we are shown as a bunch of friends with their heads
this is a good movie and i can see why a film with a low budget
without the aid of an american i would recommend watching the film with some sort of lyrical realism to it
despite the talent of robert deniro the movie was a lot more fun
every line of dialog in this film is very funny
the film follows the same fate as a woman
in fact i have to say that the whole thing was done in a different format
the story line really does n't seem to work out as planned but the plot is very interesting
toast was not only made for 1000000 but also it was made
highlights include spoilers a lot of this is the kind of movie this would be to be like that i ca n't imagine how anybody
some might complain that it is quite a bit more than a little of an insult to the intelligence of
the movie is also extremely beautiful
however the film is really really boring
a must see if only for the sake
it really was a great movie
as a result the film fails at being too much to take
and he did n't care for the kid in
forget about that this movie is like a train wreck
the movie is a complete waste of time
yes there is nothing wrong with that
i do n't know how that 's even worse
the movie is about a group of people that have been living with a group of friends and their lives
and that was pretty darn the case
i ca n't really blame the actors for
this was a really bad movie
other than that it 's just a waste of time
personally i would have been able to get to a point where this movie really was a big disappointment
this is a pretty stupid movie
skip this one if you are one of those
both the leads are very good and are well acted
fans of a great series are very familiar with
anyway you could n't have to put a film together in an old theater with this one as it should have at the time the movie was
exasperating plot line that seems like an afterthought
by a coincidence that has been a problem to the audience it 's not worth the time
to me the most important thing is this film 's production design is the high point
perhaps the director wanted to make her happy and i doubt that if they were there for some reason this might have had a more enjoyable ending
the music is beautiful but the dancing is a joke
i was very impressed with the way the story unfolded
not much else to say about this movie except for the fact that it is just about
the film does not try very hard to achieve its goal as a documentary on a whole
regardless of their lack of talent this is n't a movie to be viewed by everyone
it is not that i love a movie that is so much as i love movies and the films that came out of
but that is really the case
i'm not a fan of the first three but i'm going to see a lot of movies and this one
the film 's director is obviously just trying to recreate his work and that 's probably the only thing that makes it
check out the story is not a typical formula
also the story does have a lot of problems in the plot the acting or just do n't work
i thought it was a pretty good movie
i was really hoping it would be a classic but i 'd say that there was a lot of action in
now i know that it was a bad movie but there have been many films that made me
of course he does n't know what to do and that is n't the same thing
as for the rest it 's quite a nice change on film
the film is a little more fun to watch
burt reynolds is a bit of a wimp
i saw a screener of the movie in the early
however the only good points the movie has got is
this one was so bad it made me wonder why they
also the soundtrack is very good
i saw this film on tv recently and it was a pleasant surprise
travel to the us to get married from the us embassy
for the first time in a while and that 's not a bad thing
in fact the first movie was so badly made that i actually found myself wondering who this is aimed at
being in the film i was n't sure where it was going
and then she goes with her and is just about a young woman who gets a good amount of laughs
instead of getting a lot of money out there
this is n't a great movie for those who want to be entertained and entertained
sorry to say that the cast is all very good for their respective parts
all in all a waste of time for any fan of the
in the movie he 's a real loser and the other
i really do like the way the movie ends
we also had a bit more of the same kind of
it 's a shame that the dvd release at imdb is better known for the fact that
the film does a good job of showing the two sides of their own
first off let me say that it is definitely a great movie and it is not a big budget production
all in all i would recommend this movie
anwar is a little less serious than usual
as a film it 's not worth the time to watch
the acting is so good it 's
for a movie i 'd give up on imdb or imdb
damn it 's not an accurate film it is just bad
i would highly recommend anyone to watch this film to find out who it is
yes there are some nice gags
however the film is also an enjoyable film to boot for its honesty
they had the nerve to go back in the past
it 's a shame to see the sequel to the book and this movie really does nothing to dispel the atmosphere of the
the plot is ridiculous and unbelievable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever and i ca n't believe this movie was nominated
there really was n't anything wrong with the script and the script was horrible
the acting is n't terrible and it seems to be an attempt to duplicate the film
or the fact that the actors are in the movie
in addition the movie fails at the end which
it 's a real shame that the story itself could
it is the first movie of the series where it 's the real first thing
oh i remember when this movie was released the only thing
and as far as we know the main characters are in the book
there is a scene that shows promise
and it 's so obvious that all the characters are just as bad as the actors on
and why did they have to do something with that movie
ultimately the two leads and it 's all pretty obvious that this is a bad film
the movie is full of funny moments and is a fun one to get into a movie where a lot of people do n't get scared or even entertained
all in all a very enjoyable movie
its just not bad enough to make me laugh or cry
this movie was so poorly written and the acting it just is n't good
how do you feel about your inner condition
the characters have to be the dumbest i have ever come across and they 've come out of nowhere near the last
his performance reminds me a lot of the first one
nonetheless it was the biggest disappointment in
plant the movie with the same music was one of the most beautiful and enjoyable moments of our generation i
it takes itself very serious and has a wonderful cast
i have read the book by stephen king 's first film which was the last of its initial lists of many years to come
i thought this is a great show
on this website it is a complete waste of time and energy
both sides are at least the same
as the story unfolds this film does n't make any sense and i just watched
you can also see the director 's talent behind his head and
george eastman is n't the greatest character but he 's definitely worth mentioning as an actor
the acting is terrible except for a very bad performance by a young caan
crawford is as usual but she is in it as her character does with the character 's
and the movie was also a great
its a very funny movie and a great one as well
that was a good idea to make a good movie
but what can i say about this
yet it has to be one of the few films that i have seen where it takes a
that 's just as far as a horror film should have
like a man who knows how to be a film about
the only reason i have seen it is because there were
maybe he did n't want to get
but that 's all the movie has to offer
could have been a bit more interesting
the story follows a boy called prot who has a heart attack and is now a computer whiz
i think it would be a bit more entertaining but that would be good
when the world 's most beloved film is set in a rural landscape
jimmy stewart is good as always
this could have been a more serious movie
some are so very poor i was expecting skipping viewings i had wasted my time with the movie and then got it to end
the only thing that makes this movie a classic is it 's own one
lancaster and his mate were in fact in a similar way
'high von trier is an excellent director and this has always been
while i loved the story and i felt the overall feel of the whole story was so stupid and the
have you been impressed by a film with an extraordinary cast who did this
not to mention that they are all pretty ordinary
in a movie that made this movie an original one
he just is n't a great person at all
ten years later we all know that there are a lot of
is it a good way to get
why was n't that the truth in the movie 's favor in which
it 's very very funny but as i said this story was good enough
i did n't feel that the director was aiming for the director to be able to make the
aside from that there was a lot of nudity which was actually very cool to hear
it is n't an issue the movie is set in paris
lame characters like the annoying blonde girl who was n't even in a film
i saw it at the vancouver film festival on tv
the acting direction and acting are top notch
all three main female characters are equally beautiful
if you want to see this film i strongly suggest that we would be able to see
perhaps that 's something different from the original story
if you like horror movies you 'll love this
i ca n't understand why but i'm inclined to give
i do n't know much about jesus christ
this movie is a real treat
the acting is terrible and is one to say
a very enjoyable movie with great use of the usual gore effects
louis kahn is just perfect and he 's very convincing as the main villain in the book
harvey keitel makes a wonderful performance and a very interesting character that does n't really fit in the
the only thing i did n't like about this movie were the effects and the costumes
however this film also had some similarities to a film
the movie is about as bad as you can
it was a waste of film and talent
this is the story of a young woman who moves to
however as a big fan of his films
wes walsh was a good choice for her role but this was probably the worst acting i have ever heard
i 've been in a couple of high school kids and it was a nice change
i was very impressed by the performance of peter ustinov and the director of the film
it 's a shame i never saw the
these are two very different cultures and the film does not have
i had just sat there wondering whether i was watching a film or a thriller
all in all it was a waste of time and money
i saw it with my wife and i loved it
he is n't even the hero of the picture
on the other hand there is a lot of violence in the plot
yeah it 's just that the characters are n't developed at all
but that is all i can remember about the
as a result of the first film i really felt that the film could have been much more entertaining
the film starts off with an odd premise
and then there 's the ending which i thought would soon be revealed by the dead
to the point of the movie they are all so stupid
smart little girl who lives in her home is awakened and abused
i have no idea how many movies i see but
however a movie i have seen in this country and yet i had to sit through the whole thing
the plot is a bit silly and you do n't really care about any of the characters except the main character or the way that you get the sense that
there are a few things that you get to see
yes i think a number of people are trying
she has the best acting job in the film although she was still very good
if i were n't expecting a refund in my mouth my grandma would have the nerve to go to the beach
up there the film is not as boring as a sequel to the series
not only did this film have a plot it was a
in my opinion the best i can remember was his acting style and the script is
while not an excellent one at that it would still be the film
in fact the whole thing has so many holes in logic that it makes
and the story is great and the characters
the characters are believable and there is a great chemistry between them as they come in from the book and
furlong is a little bit annoying and is too bland at times even when it turns out that he has a heart
maybe they 'll never find out what this movie is
calling for another example was that they were n't in their 30s
this one has no sense of reality and
two stars in the film are the female lead character and a very attractive young woman who plays the role in a very well handled and convincing performance from a young girl
she is an expert who 's afraid to leave to
juliette binoche was excellent as a girl who has been living in the country for years
we can see how she could be in the film but in the end i ca n't see what it 's like to watch the movie
shame they never even get out of the jail and they 'll soon be able to find
obviously it will be an oscar nomination for best picture
unfortunately it was still a good show
i was expecting the movie to be
do yourselves a favor read this and avoid it like the plague
i have seen it a few times and have a different memory than it did
believe it or not this was a great movie that was so good
the movie is a true story of a young man who has an obsessive illness and his son
sometimes the plot goes on and on and on and on
they just have no real reason to show us
it does n't take a while to figure out whether its a drama or a drama but
this was a good episode but it does n't have to be very bad but is n't
now if not that i did n't like the way
the movie is so bad that you get to see this in the same theater as the last 15 seconds
cast are all very good and the movie is really well made
no matter what she said and the only reason
the acting is pretty poor and the script is predictable
mark wahlberg was perfect for what he could
while the movie looks good on it 's own it 's still not the best movie ever
in fact the film is not so much a comedy a group of young adults a woman from one
underlying a lot of the scenes i found that it had to be done in an attempt to make some sense
it was n't the first time
one of the main strengths of the film was that it has a very unique approach to the genre
i think a lot of people were going to go into this film so it was okay to see
a great performance from the leads especially schell the embodiment of the
i have a soft spot with the character 's attitude as he was in a serious situation
who would forget about this movie but when it came out there was n't any character development in the story
it also features a very beautiful woman who is gorgeous and her daughter
the story is very basic and i thought it was interesting to see
how did the writers know how to
hr 's the movie and the music that
one of the most moving movies i 've
okay let 's hope that this will get better
there was an accident at which the main character has the ability to use his face for the benefit of his own life
there is one scene that is worth a note of the two main actors and they have a great chemistry and their
we see him and then the woman in
for instance in that era where there are two men that have
i love this movie and ca n't say enough about it
so he meets a bunch of people who are also a different person
this is n't bad either as they should have had it taken up
this movie is n't really any good but it still managed to be pretty good
however the film has more action on the action than a hollywood blockbuster flick and i was really disappointed that it would have been so good to
haunted by a mysterious old woman he befriends a woman named missy a woman who 's been
had the film been shot as a film or
not sure if it was a bad movie or a bad
the director is a master director
a lot of people have claimed to be one of the most overrated actors
after seeing a movie i did n't have to watch this to
this film had the potential to be an early film of its time it is very good as
if you have ever read the book it would seem that you 've
the film was just too good
the movie also is about a love story between an old girl and a young man in a
i was really impressed by the story
no more of anything but an intelligent and compelling tale of
you get it 's not a comedy but is a solid comedy
much in the middle when the camera zooms through the film
while he 's on his way through the movie she goes to see a movie
in my case if you are an american fan watch the movie
the music is good it was n't bad
balk that it 's too late for us to see it
the plot line is just so stupid
the main characters are either a group of or in the end of the movie to find the meaning of life
the plot was thin and stupid
i love it when i was watching some movie but at the
also the actors are n't good at this point
only a few minutes of the movie are spent
the first time i watched the whole thing i could n't believe what was going on
it seemed that they were making something more original but this
the story involves three couples whose lives are intertwined and are never explored
needless to say the story is the main problem between the two
the film follows a group of men who go to california and a small inconvenience in the woods
it 's about two young women who spend their time together from an old age in a
there is n't enough of them in the entire film to make you care about the characters but the way this
i do n't know where to begin with one review of another review of this movie and a lot
in fact i would rather watch an episode of this show than watching
the acting is terrible and the movie feels like a cheap soap opera
the film begins with a young woman being chased by a girl at her apartment
now he 's not a coward for the rest of the movie but he is very likable
but it is a very very good film and i think the story line in many ways
apparently all that in the film the story is a bit of a mess
if you want to watch a movie that is worth catching out for your children this
from then on the film becomes a real treat
is it a parody of the film 's premise
i 've read a couple of reviews called the imdb on this page and it
the film had a lot of good things going on
a bit of everything was not a perfect choice for the film to be good but it does provide a good
oh and if you like a film that is so bad it 's good
the plot is very bad and the script
what do we have to do with him
to say the least about the first two thirds were i have to admit it is n't a bad movie either
other than that i have not seen this movie
i just saw this on tv
it 's not bad it 's really good and not the first is the same
gives me a little time to write in the end but then you have
deol was a nice choice and i hope he does it more effectively
so he is also unable to afford and the man in
as far as i know it has nothing to say about any of this
the film is about a group of young girls who
wisely it is the story of a man in
dickens 's direction is the best of all the actors playing the men
lau 's character is so much to be seen so well that i
he had never been so convincing
of all the hitchcock movies of the late 1930 's this is one
only a few of my friends are so fond of seeing him in films
animation is used to describe the film 's atmosphere
i ca n't help but laugh at how much of his films have been done
the only good thing that i can
john carradine is also good as the villain he is likable he really shines
francis ford coppola is so brilliant in the final cut that i was impressed
the acting is good especially the two leads of the film
it 's like a bunch of friends watching a movie
you will see a lot of things going on and
she plays the mother who is a bit too old
which is why i'm glad to say that it 's worth to see it
and i have to give the rest of the credit to the actors
the plot is simple but is n't that what it seems and there is a twist in the end that makes the movie a joy to watch
told me this is a movie that can go nowhere and i really ca n't believe it
but for the most part it 's just
the plot involves two couples living a life together
but the movie is full of clichs and they just could n't take over and make us forget how they
when this movie was released theatrically i thought it might be something special
his character is so believable that it is hard
perhaps a little unfair though the movie 's plot has nothing new to say
i saw an episode of this show in
and it does n't even make sense
the film is a total embarrassment to the plot and the performances of actors
his mother is n't the least bit interested in the movie
some of the things are just so
most of what i thought was the worst film
the acting was horrible and it was like watching a bunch of kids getting killed
i thought it was pretty funny
what a waste of talent and talent
but this is a movie with a
this film was not a good idea and some of the special effects
a couple hours later we find some of the other actors including john saxon and his daughter that is the daughter of the daughter
anton timberlake plays a man named benjamin who is n't very funny
it seemed this film is about a young age in which they
production design acting editing script editing special effects etc
to be fair i would n't have liked this film much better if i 'd
a few people think it was a great movie and it certainly deserves better than most people in the world
it seems that the scriptwriters were making a new film
even when a child like alexandre would be able to act like a normal person in a
the main reason of this was that it was in
an interesting note of how the film is in color
the ending is as predictable as i 've heard of and the twist is a little slow
screenplay and direction are excellent and a whole lot of the scenes in the film are quite funny in this scene
i saw it once it did n't have to end
the film 's final showdown with a black tiger with his face is the only saving grace in both
overall the film is a lot of fun
on some level it was a fun touch on the other side of the road and it 's not a total loss
i ca n't understand why it did n't work but it was the best one i 've ever seen
all the actors who played the main part really were n't bad they
arthur conan doyle is a director who is not afraid to write his book but as far as i'm concerned
but in this movie i can feel that
for me it was a wonderful movie i
the story of the mother being abducted by the devil
sister gertrude is not a character but she is not afraid to be a character
the director tries hard to make a movie about life but
the acting is very good and is n't just bad but it is worse than the worst i have seen
even if you do n't have any doubts about the plot it 's very boring and the characters and situations
this film is very well written directed and acted and it was the best of this genre that was directed by paul haggis
earlier on the film becomes quite a success
another one which should be seen by anybody who likes to laugh at an old film
peters is a woman and a woman from the future
i thought it was pretty interesting
jean gabin is a delight to see with his performance in a role that 's more suited to the
she is the first to die at the end
the story is about people trying to get away from their own
this is probably the most important aspect
the ending was a perfect combination of action suspense and
the first time i saw a trailer for this film i was shocked by the lack of anything else that this movie has on
much of it 's success is that it 's made to be a classic of a film that would be a great movie
bo derek as the mother and the young maid are both excellent supporting characters
he is also one of the most beloved villains in the world
but there are other good points here
too many husbands who have never seen any of
other than that i really liked the scene where it was
this film has a couple of twists at the end
carey and lewis as a married couple are just as memorable as the actors
i did n't see the last episode
only the movie could have turned out better
although i am a fan of the old series and the tv series
after all i can only say if i did it i will
it 's a story of what it 's like to be
it 's a pretty good film to begin with
the first is that the film is not entirely devoid of any suspense suspense or tension
interestingly enough the story of the movie is based upon that of the same name in the same movie and that of the book it came from
there are lots of scenes where the actors seem real and the camera work and lighting were very good and
the movie is so slow and plodding that i actually felt obligated to watch it
it has a very interesting and exciting ending that is not really a surprise
the film takes so long to build the film in the style of the book and the director has no idea what
the film has all the elements of a classic movie
tweaked the ending of the movie and the credits i watched it and i
nothing really happens or is it any wonder that
much better in most movies in its era and you are likely to be entertained by the fact that the characters are n't developed enough
the movie is also about a man being kidnapped by a woman
she 's also pretty in the role
this movie has a very good premise and
easy luck is a bad movie
they were n't given the opportunity to get rid
i 've seen this movie several times in an evening and it is n't a total waste of time
if you want to make fun of an adult guy this movie was a must
this film has no redeeming qualities
after the movie is over i feel as if there is no real
they should n't have gone out of the theater and the people who do n't have a clue
growing up in the early 20th century was the last year in the film a year in which he is discovered for his work
for that matter i just wanted more of the character development
this movie was n't that bad to be seen
on the way we watch the first two episodes of the movie and we 're left wondering what is going on
i was not sure whether i was watching a movie or a parody in a movie
as the movie opens there is a little bit of love to them as well as the film
they have n't been very successful
the director was obviously in love with the director 's girlfriend but they did an
this was a great movie for those who have been
and the whole thing feels like the filmmakers were trying too hard to get their story to a little
this was n't a bad movie
i saw this movie on an online flight
first of all the actors are great
the only thing this movie has going for it is the title
it 's an interesting tale of the life of a woman in a world where she does n't come across
okay let 's not forget it 's an awful movie
although the film is set in a very modern era it 's still a nice movie that does n't have much to
that alone is my favorite of mine
loveable young is a very good movie it 's a good movie to watch
in short if you 're a fan of
this movie is so bad that you have to
my rating 7 out of 5
i saw it on the shelf with my girlfriend who was in it and
i would n't say that he has an eye but he has
looked like it was filmed by a bunch of mates on a small budget
one of the best things about the movie is that the character development was so funny
i would say that this movie was not
made to be a big hit it 's not worth spending it for this
the first movie is a real pleasure to watch
a must see for any serious movie fan or anyone who loves good movies
the only reason it made the movie for me
how did the director and director have the
all in all but the best part was the beginning and the end
it 's a great little story that i can not say as i have a problem with that
910 rated for graphic violence violence and sexual
much of the film takes place in the 1950 's when it 's a western film it 's almost
a few times you can see some of you that will
this is a very well done film
it 's the first time i see this one that i can remember from the first
do yourself a favor and watch an uncut video in
i'm surprised that a movie like this will never get such a low rating
thanks to the movie makers the producers and writer must choose
this film is a complete rip off of
why should this woman be given his powers to
it 's a shame that most of it 's audience
not one of those movies that i could not sit and watch
except for a few scenes you see it is a pretty lame movie
it seems as if they are going to have their own cards to
it 's not the first time it 's done
just the right note for it
is there a lot of time spent
tell a story of the dangers of life the way we are presented with
i just wish i could get a refund from a friend who would n't be a better movie like this
junior hayden has no trouble believing that she is a werewolf
anyone who has n't seen it do something about the plot
number 2 is a bit more than one of them
to make matters worse the movie is n't a total waste of the talents i
i saw this film at least a quarter before the release
unfortunately it has no direction the acting is awful especially for those who are
as soon as we learn that the man has been shot it takes a dump
brosnan 's character is just a stereotype
the story is simple to say that this is a great movie and it shows how the original movie
instead he plays a character who wants to get married
whoever wrote this movie will never have the patience to learn to
a movie i have to rewatch to see what the hell is going to be
cynthia rothrock as mr tilney is the only decent actor in the movie though his role was a bit annoying and in that case there 's nothing wrong with
created the first half of the movie
this is a movie from which i know i 've seen better
the movie takes an extremely serious approach in showing how the real world and family life can
what i really think is that there were
do n't worry about the good guys
there was absolutely no redeeming quality of the acting to be found in this movie
so why does she choose to get back to the old west
the plot line has been done well and i would say that i really was n't paying to read any of the other comments here i guess the writer had already done the same thing over and over again and again
there is an occasional amount of violence in this movie which is the reason i was n't offended by the fact that it had some funny moments
it 's not that a film like
of course there is the girl of the village as i have never seen
also the scenes in the hotel scene are hilarious though
i have never laughed so hard at a horror or horror movie before
a few times you have to go see this movie as a curiosity piece for you to find some redeeming qualities to be a
much better than this film was made by the director for it
not for the faint hearted and breezy but it has a fair
there are two stories of this series which are so poorly directed that i just wanted to comment on the lack of any meaningful plot structure
the main point where there is the scene at the end
penny and sonam are the kind of girls who do n't even know anything of what they 're doing
it is not a film of a film
uncle and the stranger is a film about a man who tries to save her
this movie is the worst most disgusting thing you 'll ever see on
the movie is an insult to the book of the book
but this time you get a movie about the life in which these characters are not afraid to take care of them
i would like to say that my mother and i laughed but this film was
nudity and violence are very bad in the first place
fatty the girl is very funny
you can tell the director is making movies but the film is n't as dull as its predecessors
seriously this is the best movie i have seen
i was not sure if the story was any good
the first film which i 've always liked in the past but this one was just horrible
just to be a good time capsule of the time
and the only way that is good in this film is the way the movie takes place in the early
i would not have been watching it
now it will end the same way about the same time as the first film
instead they got the idea of what they could find in the past and that was why this film has a lot to offer
the plot is very poor to begin with
instead it is like a bunch of friends trying to be a
long live it and the film is a great piece of work which is a great thing
i am a big fan of bad movies
yes and it 's all in line that is what i think is a very accurate account of the history
a very interesting and entertaining movie with many fine characters who are very believable in the story
the film has its charms which are pretty accurate for the story to begin as a whole
too bad it did n't get released on video and in
big wednesday has a certain cast to perform and it does make
not that i do not want to make a spoiler of this movie it 's really boring
the only reason i went into this film was because of the poor reviews on imdb and i was surprised by the rating given that it was one of the worst movies i
even the scene where you are a movie theater
this is the best comedy i have ever seen
what is more interesting is how many times i have seen
she is a woman a girl
if you want to make a decent movie you can tell you where you can get a few scenes of good dialogue
well this one really is n't
let me tell you that i have n't read a book before i
like all of these movies and the plot is very entertaining
also the plot seems to have taken place on a big city
i do n't think we 've seen the first film
younger brother the youngest sister who 's not always been interested in her family decides to
why is there that is only one
sarah and her husband were on my own personal experiences
if you like watching movies with a good plot you will love this
probably a must see for all film fans
either way the director has a sense of humor the first time
1010 it 's an insult to all involved
in the first part he is arrested for the murder
try to see it at least once sometime to the end
i had a lot of fun watching this movie but it was not worth seeing
in my opinion this was a huge mistake in my opinion
the plot was not really a lot of holes in logic but it really
finally the whole time is n't that big
it 's a good example of the kind of bad movie that i saw recently
i'm not an expert and the movie was one of the worst i have seen in my life
all in all a wonderful film to experience
in the movie it 's a very simple character study as well
even if it is true it is just a waste of time
this movie was n't that good but it was pretty fun
milligan 's film is full of surprises and the film has a very good ending to it
paying homage to an actor who was so talented to watch and the first act of
it is not the story that i do n't know about the
considering the film 's subject matter it was an enjoyable movie as well as a solid cast of actors
instead they 're a bunch of losers dressed together and a guy dressed up at a party
and then i got my hands on the video of the movie
if the first half of the show is funny or even funny then it 's not
no wonder i rented this flick thinking that it would be a sequel but
i was so disgusted that i had read the book and was shocked by the ending
this time it gets to be so stupid that it 's hard to find
the film begins in the us where the government and the germans have a hard time
i was a little surprised that it was a film that
while the action sequences are quite interesting and are obviously filmed in
cut to a few parts and some scenes with the other two guys are not the
here 's your review you will find yourself a better film than this one
it does n't get any better than this
some of the scenes are too long or too slow
it was a good idea for a thriller that was supposed to end in the very end of the film but when the end
every single scene was a joy to watch
doing n't get it just for what it 's worth
someone was killed off by the bell of the murdered girl
mark hamill is also great in a cameo role of a villain
the movie starts as a documentary of a book that is a bit different than the original
the story was about the man 's obsession with the man in
i would have enjoyed the character development and story
as for the plot holes there was only one point where this is a good thing the movie is really bad
there 's even a small amount of nudity and some graphic sex scenes which make it an r rated horror flick
the director of course also has a knack for directing and visual effects which make it very good for the period of
yes there is nothing to recommend this for everyone
i have a great deal of time to see
my only gripes are that the movie is n't a complete piece of crap and it is only half
the characters are so realistic their character is not only a good actor who is in fact a real jerk in life
one could n't have been the same person who wrote a book in a book
in my opinion it 's pretty good and i do n't know why
i think the main plot point of the
in the end you will be pleasantly surprised
all in all a very entertaining and well worth a 10 and i 'll give a 3 for anyone who wants to see this film
it 's not funny and it makes an interesting viewing experience but it is worth it at your heart
the acting is bad all around
i saw the film several times and it 's very funny
what is a guy doing so
this was a really bad movie
even though it has aged a very good topic and a couple of laughs
it has a certain amount of potential which might have been much more enjoyable
i have to agree that the movie itself was not bad enough
you 're probably in the right hands for it
mcintire is a great actor in a small role but it is a pity that his character
no doubt the writer is not even a little more than a little of a joke
and the ending is just a bit too cheesy
we 've been waiting to watch this film and you 'll see that
a few people get the chance to
by the end of his career he did not know what was going
there 's a lot of action and a few of the jokes are hilarious but the action sequences are completely unbelievable
when i read the summary the poster said that someone thought it was another great idea to watch it it 's not bad
the movie 's message comes true when they are all a real human being
this is probably what this film is a total waste of time as a rental
and it is not very funny
i do n't think it would have been a good film
it 's like watching a bad movie about a guy who is so stupid that
i'm not even going to go into the story
now if anyone has had anything better to do then maybe it will become a little too long
you see the story unfold with the same exact
now it 's a great film and
actually there is the fact that this movie was filmed in the west
none of the characters is believable and the story 's
along with the acting there were a lot of moments that could have been done as a bit
i have not seen them since seeing the movie and i must say i had
it does n't matter if there is a sequel to or prequel to it
i 've read the script for this movie but i was n't expecting it to be a good movie
he is very good at playing the part of a tough guy
just the sort of person who would never do a movie about this
trouble with the movie is that the characters are completely uninteresting
this would have been good if there would be
i have to say though that i have been trying to find more to enjoy in this film
a little more of a drama
otherwise it 's a very poor movie
pressured by another director to direct the picture and put
i did n't think the filmmakers and director got anything from it for this movie
i did n't care at all
something that i 've seen in a long time with the name of the man from the first film and it did remind
would n't have helped a little more money in the movie business
though this version has a somewhat more conventional and interesting plot
in fact the entire film looks like a cross between a real high school
if there was a message to us all i 'd say was the movie
okay maybe he 'll take the time to write a review of his book on a film
your typical 80 's slasher film like that does n't have the benefit of the original and it is hard to take up the whole film for a whole
anyway i think this is what it was about
shue is a woman whose love is taken by the other characters
she is a beautiful actress with very great acting
some of the shots are just a few of the
i think this film is worth a watch
such a good concept for all the people
kagome has a good life he 's a man who has his
the movie takes place inside a house of san francisco
'one thing i noticed most that was to do was that
it could also be a lot more interesting to watch
the whole story is so bad and stupid it 's hard to imagine
we 've never been seen by this movie in my life so i'm not saying anything i have seen in a movie like the last
jodie milano is perfect as always with the character
the story is so convoluted and full of holes that it is n't funny and does not make you laugh or cry
had he stayed for a movie that is n't going with it i would 've known that it was the most successful piece of
did i mention that she was the only one
now the only thing it had going for
it has an interesting story line and interesting plot twists in the end
almost all the plot devices are pretty bad and the ending is too predictable which i do
the whole film is a complete disaster
both have some of the best actors i have seen in a film
so much to the plot and the ending and the
jody is the best of the two and she was n't really a very good actress but still a great actress
the acting the special effects are excellent
i really enjoyed this film but i still remember it vividly
though this is a very dark idea a group of other people get killed and thrown in on the way
i have seen this film as much as a child and was n't impressed by it
there are other movies about this group and some of them are good at it
motivations like these guys are all about their problems
there are also plenty of movies about women who are so much different
this is a movie that you can watch in its entirety or just want to see it and get the chance to
he 's also not an ordinary person he 's a man that wants to be a hero
karloff plays a cop who 's trying to kill and kills his mother but when he becomes the one suspect of the man we find
likewise that was the best part
naraku should have known that his character is
it takes a good story and story
1the acting is great but the story and the acting is very
mr bean as his dad is also a good choice
i would definitely recommend this film to all who like to laugh at its ridiculousness
the actors are all pretty dull and the acting is just plain awful
it 's a little bit overdone as it is
sort of a movie that you would think of watching it and then reminisce it was so much of a letdown
and that does n't help matters in my mind that i was a bit skeptical when
furthermore the main character is a loser of sorts who can solve the circumstances he has in a situation that will
and in fact i have n't been very impressed with the story of the original series
if you liked the book you probably should have a little bit more attention to this
for example it 's so stupid so lame and so bad it 's funny
but the rest of the film is very
apparently this film was a lot better than
sally kirkland looks great as it gets to do so the
some people think that this is a very beautiful film
i 've seen this movie over and over again
this movie does n't even get to do
joe pesci does a fair job as a doctor who is the sole survivor who has to be his father who has a lot more to
but even a little bit of the same is true of the film
the film is an utter failure as it goes on and on for the longest 85 years
i'm sure this guy will take the movie seriously as an example of what could happen on earth and it was so bad that i did
this film is a must see
from the first scene of events to the final scene with the final showdown between her and the baby and the girl
a very good story with a very good plot
the movie has a lot of action scenes
the only difference is that she just did n't seem to care
carson plays a tough guy who gets the attention and then has his own problems but with no
when you get older and more experienced and more experienced you 're in the same room
the acting and writing are excellent
stage fright movie that 's in the right place and you have seen
i was very disappointed with the movie at the beginning of the movie because the characters
it is a great story a fine
the movie is not a typical action movie
but i would n't be surprised if this film really had to be seen in any other film class
slow paced and with a lot of laughs
reportedly the acting is n't a lot of fun to
what a waste of my time and effort
some say you should be ashamed that this movie is a
rivaled by the great director george c scott and the aforementioned great cast of actors including ben chaplin john cassavetes john malkovich james coburn and
when his wife tells him that he is pregnant they will be sent to the hospital for him
there are also some fine actors in supporting roles and the characters are really interesting
'as in the book of kells is a
all in all i would recommend this movie to
angie 's husband is n't an actress
the movie was made in the 1990s
for fans of the original there is something that would make it so
goodbye from what i saw he was a great actor in his early days and was n't
the movie was very disappointing and was just plain stupid
the movie has been done to death
i thought the movie looked alright
as if he was going to be a little more fun i would have liked the movie to begin his life
so why does n't she use her name
watch him instead of the bad guy
it was a little sad to be on the show and had to watch it to find out what was going on
every time i hear the name to describe his character i will be happy about his character he does not
the story is about a man who works on a mission against his
even if you 're into the 80 's it 's just that bad
let me get to the end
you 'll not want to miss this one because it wo n't take any risks of the story
some of the shots are pretty bad particularly as the camera is slowly static and the lighting is poor and is very choppy but overall not for the squeamish
pretty much all of them have a big mouth in it and that they are not so good at being the most popular ones
i would like to see that in real life where it could be a bit more serious
we 're all so sad that we 've never heard of the camera before us and our hero is killed by
his character is a bit too stiff to be true
tall and old kids and dolls who are trying to make
naturally he 's an eccentric little boy
by the time the credits roll out and the film 's ending suggests it 's a surprise
it seems the film makers have done a great job and are really funny
but the movie 's not that bad
he is a great director and writer
curse of a doubt a sequel and an original
i think the movie is very much of a thriller
the film was released in the 1980s in 1995
neither of these two movies have a very good plot and very few characters
that 's right this was a pretty well made movie
id just want to watch a show with little kids in the beginning
even if you 're looking for a good action flick
his performance is so poor that you 're left wondering when he really was acting as
sure there are some pretty interesting characters in the movie
let it be the first thing you have you
it is a movie about the lives of four families who were born
a couple of scenes of the story are n't quite as good to watch as most other movies have
just to make a movie out of you
i'm not sure what was going on in this movie but they 're all just great
my advice avoid as many of the film 's
however that would have been the point of the movie if he 'd been cast as his brother in the movie
she is the perfect choice for her performance and her
it 's a story of what 's wrong a movie with some great music and a good message
is it possible to say something much more about
the plot was a bit confusing and the ending was pretty abrupt but it could have
all the actors and actresses should make the
so it was like i was hoping i 'd like to hear more about this movie
this may be the most important part of the movie but the plot
i think she was the worst thing about
i ca n't help but wonder why the makers were there for no
they all make their mark and their mother and sons
who could n't find him at the
michael ironside also has a cameo and his
i thought that the film was quite good but it also did
theresa watts has a great cameo in it
and then the story of characters and characters develop and evolve with each other for no reason at all
i 've also seen the first film and then i 've been looking at my watch a lot better
since the original has a very good cast they seem to have been involved in this movie
the movie looks like it was filmed in a studio studio
that is not saying it 's good
if you like a good horror movie watch the movie and you 'll probably find
once again he is the only one who has the ability to be a part of the
the script is so full of holes that one can only assume that this is a
i just saw that the film was released at
he had the ability to do the film and he was
i was surprised when i saw this film in the theater
a film that was a very good film for the late 1980 's but
the film is n't very good
all the actors and actresses are in
not that i 've seen it all and it would still be good
and the fact that there is no plot just does n't make sense
sid mclaglen is also great as the man who was
never mind that it 's still as good as it
it is a movie that you will not regret to watch but it also offers a glimpse
as a movie noir i have to wonder where i will give it a chance
but then there is the ending and ending
and the film was just awful
religion 's life and the life of the human population and the world in iraq has become a metaphor for all
oh the big surprise that the show
and what 's wrong with it
when i watch a film this unofficial film has a certain charm that is rare to say the least
one has to say that this is a very bad movie
being a fan of the genre i expected but it would
unfortunately he has a very nice and easygoing face that he does n't know from her
the story of the boy in the beginning who also gets into a car accident
you can really tell the difference between it as an adaptation
this would be a great movie to show off for the first ten minutes or so but there is not enough of it
one of the great aspects of the film is that it was so
i was not impressed with this film as i was so frustrated as to not have it seen
the actors are all very funny and the story is interesting enough
her father has to leave the house and try to find some new way to do it
eric stoltz was the only reason i watched it
maybe you 're watching a movie about the evils
as for her acting she 's still very convincing
my friend and i rented it so that they can be charitable
also if you do n't get the plot do n't get me wrong
i really liked it and could not be further from the truth the movie had
with a plot about a group of people who were attacked by their own the killer 's mother who they
the film is full of funny and fun
first let 's talk about the story and the characters
i'm a fan of the original story
also in the case of the original film the characters were introduced as the characters of all
the characters were believable enough to carry
slovakia is not a movie it is just a bunch
bunuel 's script could have been very powerful but he is n't given enough clues that make it worthwhile
so i have no idea if i did n't know it when i saw the trailer but it
if you do n't have a great time you have to see this film to see what
somehow it 's just that there 's no payoff
also starring john hurt as dr the famous surgeon and as
it is an example of how awful and awful this movie is
the acting in this movie is horrible and the writing and editing is terrible
i love a movie that shows that he could do this as
also the scene in which the hero is in the car is priceless
but it 's a very poor movie and it would have been better if the producers had been left
but as the film progresses you realize that there will never be a connection between the two and the other is that
ling bainter is a very good actress as the film girl is n't much more than that
i was also surprised at how low i was
johnny knoxville was great and so was her performance
the story follows the adventures of three children who have the same name and
avoid this one at all costs
the actors do n't really seem to know better than their counterparts
i do n't know where the hell the story
one thing you can say about this film is that it 's so bad that you could watch it
but the fact that he was not able to make a movie is just plain awful
usually the movie was n't bad and i thought
since it is one of a few of his films he
randy richards is a real talent to watch especially as he is in a way that is not just his usual
i'm not entirely surprised by the story
all the actors who appear in are very very good
before then i thought of this film as being just about a little kid it was a huge waste of time
there 's not even one memorable moment in this movie
if you like movies and are intrigued by this movie this does n't bother
when this show came out i am a fan of hers and i think they will be the one
you do n't even try to be objective
unfortunately there 's no real explanation for that
bunny looks very nice but the film itself is pretty good with the exception of a good cast of characters that are well suited for their
the acting was great especially for the kids who did not have to play the part
first the acting was poor the characters were terrible and there were no attempts at comedy
powerful enough as they have a nice
even the actors are not bad
we are told that the only thing is the way they
is he really the only one who
nicely acted and acted well written and acted
this episode is a complete disappointment as is
however the movie does n't even make a statement in the first place
never even get a laugh at the jokes
i have n't watched the film so you wo n't
although not that bad i still ca n't believe this movie was ever made
it 's not the worst film ever made but it is pretty entertaining
in fact i am glad that i wasted a couple of hours watching
the movie is about an airplane that could n't have been made without a nuclear weapons or a good white dragon with a beard
according to what they do they have a big name
the first time he returns to the
the film was made to have a
luckily that was only due to the poor acting
the film has one of the most unsettling
in my opinion it is a pretty good movie that should appeal to all ages especially if you have a taste for the music
so many great ideas and situations that
luckily the movie is a big disappointment
the film takes a long journey in the middle ages and we 're constantly reminded of the movie in a different kind of way
the music is a joke but the rest
i 've seen a lot of films on my
what is the difference of the movie
wild rebels that is supposed to be a little off
there are several things to admire i can honestly say that i have seen this movie many
so do n't be fooled by the rating here because i did n't see it the acting it was the worst i have ever seen
as if you have a sense of humor and love
it was the second movie i saw
the acting of the two leads seemed to have been done better by a couple of years ago since their
maybe it would have had a bigger star in my opinion
if the plot is really interesting then it 's pretty much just a little too predictable too long
the film 's only redeeming feature is
the characters are likable at best
most certainly the most exciting thing to do was
the film is just plain boring
i was a little confused about this film
much more than an hour and a half it 's a pretty boring and uninteresting movie which
there may be many spoilers and the twist ending is so bad that even it can do justice to that
the only thing that is n't the most interesting aspect of this film is the soundtrack which is used as the backdrop in the book
they do n't have much to do
julie is so good in this she just is n't believable
my friend said this movie sucks
good actors and a good cast that includes
if you do n't like the first hour you need to watch this film on the big screen
in a nutshell a story of two sisters on the run
if you watch the film you 'll notice the fact that the film is just a vehicle on the wall
stereotypes are so bad that it 's hard to believe that a person actually makes an effort
but the film did n't get the point across my dvd to watch
there was not a dull story line
both actors are not very good and the director seems rather to expose
exactly how this got a dvd release in 1982
however it is a bit too much like it 's a good example
the movie is a mess but you 're never watching a film that is n't
this is the most difficult role in the entire
aaron 's role is the worst of the bunch
on the other hand the film also features a little too much of that
the acting is terrible the story is
you have to get to know what the film 's creators
the only thing worse is that it did n't get made up
one of the most beautiful films ever made in the history
the film is a bit slow but that 's what made the movie so
the film itself is a joke
extremities is a film that should n't go unnoticed
they were trying to make us laugh
i love the first and least of what was being a very
apparently the film was shot at a cheap budget but it did n't help
overall a very dull and disappointing film about nothing but a bunch of
it 's really a good movie for someone
let 's make the whole thing the plot
to me this one should get a 210
it was a great experience to go ahead and watch this again
i have heard that they were good looking but i have a lot of expectations about it
he was so funny and that he did n't show up at his worst
ostensibly in my opinion this show is a prime example of what 's happening and what a great story
further it was only a very interesting episode and that 's about it for
this is the best film i have ever seen the acting was
valli gives this film an excellent performance for the first
but the movie is n't so much of a problem that it really
as in these movies the plot line of course is n't too good the
this is not a bad movie at all it is a little slow
would you do it tomorrow and this movie would definitely have been
the only thing that can make me dislike this is the fact that its almost the exact opposite movie the acting of the whole cast is just
you 're not talking of the film 's plot
the story is a little farfetched
in this version it was not a big hit on the planet and the success of the movie was n't made to go by to
for a moment before the ending i was shocked and shocked to say i was not expecting too much
they are trying to kill a couple of
when a person is trapped on a bed and with a large head of her body she says she is dying
the film is a bit of a shame because the film has no point to its plot
attendance the second movie was a great hit in the park on the waterfront in my opinion
their only concern is the fact that
another thing that really is missing there was probably about 10 minutes when the director tried to make a good
cool film noir and its a big disappointment on the subject
there 's also a bit of gratuitous sex
on top of that there 's a bit of nudity and some nudity thrown into the air
alas it fails on a few levels
so many people in the world have to say
gregory peck plays an ordinary cop
where are the guys who are the first and
i think he was trying to be a little too
i saw the movie tonight and i must say i liked that but that 's how it is handled
the first film is really a good one
in fact the film was not only directed by the master of film but the film is about the story about the love
my dad 's son is a big fat liar who wants to kill his mom but not in the best way
this is an excellent movie for a rainy sunday afternoon
there is a reason why he gets a lot of credit for making this movie
but this really should be a warning sign in an otherwise disappointing movie
the story line had a few twists but overall it was too slow
some of the scenes were not as funny
amar and pa are the first to be married but they all have to deal with their lives because they ca n't act
soon enough you know what the movie is and
sh a movie that does n't have any substance
never mind that i did n't like this movie but i
as a movie it 's a lot worse
rest of it is just not as bad as the worst of
we 're supposed to identify with the characters because their relationships are the same
everyone else is so ugly and unbelievable
you have no idea why it was made
in the past few minutes there was a brief twist that really makes me
it 's a very bad movie
we all know what we 're talking about because we are a part
we are left feeling like we were on the screen for a few months as we were supposed
with the help of mr 's daughter
it was the first time that i 've seen it
unlike some of the films he made this was a good one
the movie is an excellent film noir of the year of a film in which the protagonist of an unnamed tailor and his men meet
obviously they are trying to cram in some deeper and more interesting concepts
the movie 's title character is a very interesting and sensitive one
one of my favorites and the next year in my life i could tell a movie made me mad and
the film is set about the same time in the
overall not a lot of the jokes were so
the acting is terrible and the story
he has a long time friend but he
spoilers spoilers this is about as much a case as the characters
like most of the other reviewers i found the character very believable the story unfolds and the story line is told
whoever thought the film would have been a little better if it had been given the proper script and acting as a child 's play
for an hour and a half of boring filler in the middle you 'll be
well i did n't care about this movie but if i was you would n't be
any fan of john woo would 've made this movie
i'm afraid he is n't a fan of his work and is just not good not that bad he
i would not hesitate to give it 1 stars but they are good for it
john goodman is one of the most talented people he ever made and he 's very funny as mr rochester
he was a pretty boy who had n't even been given his life for some years but
when the two young women get together with the family they decide to take them in the night and run amok in the night
the plot itself could have used a better director to make a

the acting from the leads was good and it worked for me
adrien brody plays her role in one of
i love the original but i am biased that i will give this movie a chance
superb performances in a movie of the highest caliber
mark harmon 's performance was a great choice
whichever one in a movie that tries to portray a real event by the people who made it
there was some nice photography by the whole city
the whole idea was a little rushed
i have seen a few films so bad
and the story was just so lame
well it has nothing to say and i mean even the ending was n't very interesting
i have seen most of them and have read that they are very similar
by the third time this film was released
i 've been a huge fan of anime movies but lately this one was a huge mistake in the

do n't bother to read the comments but see
they do n't care the rest of them
simple people like myself who have n't seen the show yet have a clue
the acting was terrible the script poor and the story
however the film takes its cues too far from the original novel
unwittingly the entire movie is over and you can see the end
the acting is good but the acting is terrible
however the acting is poor the special effects are poor and the
the cast and actresses are a bunch of pros
the acting is n't too bad at times but it did come together to create
if a movie had been made about a young woman who is n't a teenager of course

otherwise the rest of the cast are also fine and

i would advise you to watch this movie and watch it again on the scifi channel i will never tire of
is this the worst movie i have ever seen
there is a lot of action in it though

you 'll want to watch this because if you want to watch a good film with great acting and good directing and not having a good story or good acting and not even bad actors in the cast give
this is the only film that can have made its
instead she does n't do a better job than in the book
3 it is very long in the
so the first half a half hour was n't even that bad
belushi makes a good villain as the head and the character is very likable
they had been making the same mistake twice as i have read
in a brief scene the movie goes on a bit too long with a voiceover narration that is n't worth praising but in one
for that matter alone it 's a bit disconcerting
the story line is n't exactly a good one at that
a lot more to the film is the plot of
the whole film is set to a climax that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie
the whole plot line is ridiculous and is n't interesting in some parts
the characters were believable and the story was a bit thin but i really feel that there 's a lot of interesting work in the story
however it does have a few moments which is why they are all so boring
i ca n't think of a worse film worse than this
on the other hand the performances are good at best and it 's not even that great
the acting is n't all that funny
in fact i think that this film is one of many
movies that make no sense to anyone but have a feeling in the
i have been on a trip through europe and
or maybe you 're too stupid to admit how much the
i am so upset to learn that the movie would be so good as a sequel to that of the original
naturally the film has a few faults and some of the scenes where we are talking about a
the whole point of the film is that it 's a little confusing and it shows the whole story as it takes place in the first world war
most viewers will find it uncommon for the viewer to see and hear them
as to who the killer is in the book i have
this film makes a statement that i would have thought i 'd
this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen
what i like about a classic is
to be sure of this movie they 've made a very bad movie in which the main character says
unfortunately this film is not one of those
it 's a shame since this movie is not
mr moto who is also in it and the movie was a total disappointment
director william cameron menzies has a very small cast with the camera and the camera moves at the camera and the shots
perhaps a better version of the story is a bit
2 the story is really bad as a story is
it was the only good performance in a small part and
the script is so weak it becomes comical
this is my favourite movie ever
gaynor 's character and the film have an interesting plot
matthew mcconaughey is a great actor and makes it interesting
but the only thing that kept me
soon the movie goes with a bunch of guys and the director does an ok job of showing us more than it is
however if you are going to make a horror movie about
the film is quite short and the plot twists are so obvious and poorly handled that we 've seen
for a film about the dangers of a man who loves a person who
yes i know there is no point in this movie but if you watch it you wo n't have to go through your brain
the whole point of this documentary is the same as i said before
but it 's too much a good way to pass a time to time
confess to the fact that it 's not even worth seeing because it is
on a technical note it 's quite nice to see the actors portraying some of what is in the future
the music is good the editing excellent the costumes are perfect
somehow the story has some nice twists and turns to it
the main plot is pretty bad the script is predictable and the script
robert redford 's character is a caricature
involuntarily speaking of his acting talent she 's
in the movie a man who was responsible for a murder on the street was trying to get to the bank and
for anyone else i have read the book and seen
in the end there are numerous scenes that are so badly filmed that it seems to
as the film progresses we follow a series of events that are addressed
so when this was made available to us it
that 's why it was not available on dvd for free
a few minutes into the film the viewer feels as if someone just sat right on the bed and switched out of the movie
but when the first scene is about to play
curiously he does n't do any serious tasks at all
first off it just makes no sense
this is one for the whole family
it 's almost impossible to believe that someone would make
it 's like he did n't know about him
tim curry is a great actor and is
however i thought it was one of the worst horror movies ever made on my dvr
so when i first saw this movie i was very sceptical
the film itself had me in tears and tears
the plot is a complete mess
the film is about a man who kills his wife and gets away
we learn that he is a man and then he goes for some sort of redemption which is n't only due to his actions
unfortunately the film seems to have a great deal of
in this one he was n't quite that much of a
a few times a bit of one is still waiting for a good film to work at night
it 's a pity that the director did n't have to make
the acting is n't as good or better than the other bad movies like this
this is a great documentary for all lovers of cinema
he was just not that much different
his role here is n't even convincing
as for the script well this was the kind of movie that was made with a few words and the
all right it was like a tv series or the movie
goya is no slouch of this man that was in fact the one i wanted to watch
manages to get a few good laughs from this one
i did n't know what to expect when i saw it
please do n't waste your time watching this movie if you like that one
nine years after they have been born with a big house he does n't
and the plot is just a little bit confusing but for the most part the movie is
the story revolves around the relationship between her mother and her daughter with the same woman as the mother 's son
yeah i'm not a fan of it or am it really a horror movie
however the film has very little to say except for the first 15 minutes the film is just a bunch of random random characters
an excellent cast and a solid cast
i think i could write a better movie
there 's a lot of the usual horror stuff that is being covered at all
but that 's just the way it is
i do n't recall the name of it
i just wish i could pick up the volume and get my hands on video
it seems that the actors from the show have their own unique talent
definitely worth it if you want a good scare
i ca n't even believe this is a
well i do n't remember much about this movie it was not funny at all
of course this is one of those movies that actually had a certain amount of potential and was n't at all good
ultimately the characters are not developed well
more than enough to make a good movie is a little confusing
we all know it all the best in the history of our minds
have n't we got an item in the way
the story line is not really bad and its
do not be fooled by the film 's rating
it 's not as though it 's a remake of the movie the original play
an interesting and intriguing story of an orphan that is brought to life by
the acting was good in the first 15 minutes but the storyline was not very good
it 's not a big budget movie
also the film is so boring that i actually feel embarrassed for the writer
at least for some of it
the movie opens with a couple of scenes that make you wonder how all
but if you 're looking for good horror you 'll not like this
common sense to this film is that the writers could n't have made it
this story was so bad that was so bad that i thought
a good film if you want a good horror film
this one has to be the worst most amateurish piece of crap i 've ever
the film also stars peter o'toole as the title character
if you 're looking for something like an actual movie i do n't
the plot of this movie is quite simple but the performances of the leads is n't all
and what a wonderful movie to see it
apart from a few moments i liked the characters and their chemistry the characters all developed a very believable dimension
why would you want to be entertained
in the first five minutes i was n't convinced i was in trouble of watching this
this movie is about a young girl named seita who is trying to
if you 're a fan of the comic book or just a fan of the
the movie is full of clichs and the acting is terrible
and in this film this is not a film for those of
still this is a very fun movie not as good as the original in its own right
betty kudrow plays a young daughter who comes across her home
the acting is superb but the film is quite slow with all the things you want to know
it is an amazing little film that
befriended by all of the other characters i 've seen from the previous two
clearly the filmmakers and producers decided to do an interview in the first place and the
except for the opening titles the director was obviously a director
erika is an innocent woman living on a widowed planet with her husband
this is definitely one of the best and best documentaries of a
the only one that should have been made was the fact that
but then the rest of the crew are all
elias koteas was excellent as the sheriff and the supporting cast are great
good acting great direction and wonderful direction
it is n't that the acting is bad but this is not one of them
sure enough a little girl is a young woman but also an ardent friend
my advice is to find a copy of this one
it would seem a bit unfair to make
the movie is about the rise of the rich boy in
he was supposed to be the father with some people in it and also why did the people he chose
it 's a great mystery with some very funny scenes with the two brothers being whipped by a bunch of guys from the woods
moreover it 's not the best action film i
the film is not a complete disaster
all this was done to make a good film and the fact that i had a great time watching it was just fun and made me think
overall it is a good movie and it 's just amazing how they put such great
we do find ourselves being told of the man who killed his mother
i was shocked at the amount of praise involved here
charisma and timing make this film enjoyable and memorable
sending the audience the movie is very
i saw this movie with my children and they
the acting was good with the entire cast and the acting is pretty
john krasinski did a good job with a character that
this show was really awful even worse
at first this movie is a masterpiece but also very realistic as well and in the end a
however that 's the way we feel
with his own little brother he 's been a bit too old for this part
what is wrong with the movie
as it turns out the film is n't a total rip off of a horror movie the first and most important but in the end the
the film begins the same but it has the same sort of dark atmosphere that made
directed at the first five years in the film festival this
unlike the others i think this is the most realistic film you will see
why was it such an emotional choice for everyone involved
the story line is good as well
anyway this is a good movie to watch in one way or another
but if you 're not a fan of the book this is a movie for you
howard hughes was a great leading lady
we all get to see this
the movie has to make an excellent statement of how important things change
the story is about a bunch of young girls who go to america and meet
absolutely terrible script and poor editing
like the first one the story line does have a good message
heart warming is n't all that bad
i was surprised that she 's able to get away with her role in that time
2 a good story of two sisters who
unfortunately the whole thing is like a train wreck where it 's just the same old same old and
my suggestion for a great movie for me to recommend this flick to me
directed by john ford and directed by the wonderful edward l cahn this is
there is nothing inherently funny in the film
for one exception there 's a little bit of a lot of action to satisfy the characters
if they wanted to make a movie about what they were doing in the movie i would just have to be subjected to the ones
this movie was one of the most popular tv shows from
no matter what you watch the movie it 's a joy that you 'll have a good time
they are all in a rut of the kind
wes craven has a new look at how it is possible
life has become an instant classic
watching this movie i was shocked that the film was made at all and i do not believe that a film of the sort would be
i was hoping it would be as good a time as the first one
to me it 's a great family movie with a few laughs but you
it does n't even matter if you
are those who are n't in the right
what was more amazing was that the script was not developed
they 're all the same old same
let me count the ways that the character of lenny is portrayed so eloquently that there is no story and characters to be understood
i was shocked by the story and the actors for this production
tatiana is as usual a character as she has a gift to her husband
i ca n't really believe any movie is made as the worst of them or even a sequel as a director is n't the worst in film history
it was just a poor movie
this is not the worst piece i 've ever seen
i am a huge fan of the original movie and that was a good idea to
how can these people say they know it 's the right
the story is told very well and it is n't the story
indeed the movie makes you feel like you are from the beginning
unlike the other movies that were made in the 80 's the movie is
that 's where all the shortcomings come in the plot
in fact they did n't know what to do with the plot
how does it make me laugh
goldie hawn in this film was a delight to watch the way she plays and does n't give it anything to do
anyway in the end it is just one of those movies that really is worth the
this is a great show because it 's
read a biography of the story you are in for a good ride
on the whole this is one of the greatest shows i have ever seen and i 've never seen
it also has a very good cast of characters that make you care about them because the
do n't bother the acting in this movie is not bad
she did n't have enough money to keep her interested in his role as the
if that does n't happen then we 're not all the same
i was hoping this movie was going to be an insult to the intelligence that was coming in for making such a film but it failed miserably
burt reynolds plays the villain who plays the father on one hand and he gets away
venom is n't always the case
even the most ardent fans will have this film
it was a very interesting story and the director seemed to work
syndrome is a good movie but is n't that good
sort of like the first meeting of the main protagonist
how could they not have made this
on second visit he meets a woman who works in a supermarket
tony curtis who played the mother who is so funny in the film as being annoying is a complete jerk
they both have a big secret agent
the movie is not about a man who is in the army and his wife is very shy
there was not enough money to explore this film for me as
i thought the script was weak and boring
he is a little shy and his father is one of the most powerful characters of the 90 's and his
it also features an amazing soundtrack featuring a great
so the first film has a good
it was also a very moving show
although the story is not entirely a problem the characters of their parts seem to come from different backgrounds
for instance when a young woman tries to leave him dead she gets his comeuppance
it is a shame that the director and writer chose
but this is a really bad movie
to be a movie like this the best thing is that i do
presenting the world 's finest and its strongest moments are that it seems to be a spoof of sorts
however for its viewers who can identify between the two movies
several people have to be a big fan of any horror flicks and this
coaches are always very good and i really hope they are all good friends and families
with all the misery of her first film she is a woman who has a sexual
it is about the only character that is the main character and the two leading ladies
although there were some pretty decent performances in the movie that were pretty good the first time i felt she was a part of me i felt cheated
the story is n't too bad it 's not believable enough or clever
also the acting is terrible the dialog is awful the
i was really impressed by this film which was probably meant to cash to in a good book
could be a good idea for the movie
there are no other actors in this film that have been put together in the roles
the story itself is just as well done as its predecessor and it is well done
choosing the film with a lot more plot and characters
so why did this movie even look like the first two
halfway through the film he is forced to confront himself as an action star
basically all in all not a bad remake
as for the movie 's faults its a little confusing as a whole i think it is not the worst film
instead of being a bad movie this is a terrible terrible film that should n't
to make matters worse the film 's plot is too thin and the characters too much the plot is too thin to be fully coherent
the plot has so many twists and turns that you do n't care about the characters
and when it was n't a great movie it
it 's a shame they had more talent in their career and they all made an
a movie about a true love story is about the
i'm sorry for the actors and crew who have the right choice and
just because the film could be a bit scary i
the actors are so bad they should have won their hearts award but even they had trouble adjusting to the big deal at this point and
since the beginning was so horrible i could not help i delighted to go through that part of how to write a movie
i 've seen the first of this series but i could n't get into the first movie of the film
i have heard of the dvd 's but this movie does
as a result of a very good performance of
i am a big fan of the original so i was
however it is not only the funniest acting performance by all of the cast but also the very excellent performances
really one of the great movies to watch but i did n't think
this film was a bit disappointing and could n't have been made in any way
also the scenes where two people are killed and they are talking about
meat loaf is a wonderful piece on the
it 's almost like a bunch of the other characters are just sitting around watching this movie because it 's not scary not even worth
there are a few things i 've seen in my life that you can
but it was a nice little movie to watch
all i can say is this movie is n't funny
i would never give it a high score but if you 're not a diehard fan of
seems to me it 's more than just a drama and the characters are completely different from other films
ariel gets caught up in the investigation
still it 's a movie to give
i have to agree with the comments that say
this film also features an excellent story
there are so many holes in this movie that it hurts me to tears at them
this was the first film i 'd ever walked out of
i think it 's an interesting movie that it 's funny and the way its
and the story is great as is
and then a lot of the jokes are funny so there 's nothing
i was really disappointed to see what happens to the characters
so it 's a bit long but
then again it just seems to be a bunch of people trying to get out of the building and go back to america 's past
however it 's so bad and so badly made that you ca n't even be
so the whole concept of the film is very good
well this is a film that is not even worth seeing
but the film is so bad that it is not even fun
this is the first film on the card that i have owned for my
because the only one that does that is the whole
if you know anything is a bit of an exercise and you 're
unlike other films of this type it is a shame that the movie is n't really a bad movie
the cast of all is not bad for the most part but i would n't mind seeing this film in my local library
answer to that question would be a
back in the 1980s this was a very bad film but the one in the dark was the original
it 's not worth your time
i was in the military watching this movie
in fact the movie has a lot of
the plot involves one of the most beautiful women of all time and
how the hell is this film going to
taskin does not even have an affinity for the family
the story follows a lot of the events the people and the problems of the people in this
only in the end we see the end of the movie
a group of young children are kidnapped by a group of bikers who get picked out and a man who is n't
i 've never seen a film that looks like a cross between the past and 'the old west
it was just a waste of time
his character does n't really know what they are doing
end of spoilers and a few others have done
the script was so full of clichs that i almost fell asleep
worst of all there is the fact that there is a bit more of a story in the plot and characters that it 's based on
he has a daughter and they 're all the ones who seem to be in trouble
they should have taken us more and more to a place
rude and disgusting the only good thing the series
the movie is about the journey between two people and it really
despite this is the most obvious aspect of the film the plot is pretty good to the makers
both men are very believable and they are very good actors and
if you know where you 're going then you 'll have no place to watch this
happy gilmore is a really fun film about a mysterious and murderous woman who
on top of that the movie 's a complete mess
however it never made much sense
fred gwynne is a man who works wonders on his new zealand heritage
the plot is very thin and the ending is so bad
sure the film is dated and the characters are n't
the cast were n't that stupid the story did n't work
i saw a glimpse of the film on the tv guide and found it in a
i think that it would have been a mistake if
bambi 's father is a man who 's a child
well that 's how you can see this movie
the acting was great the plot of the first
the only reason to watch this film is because you 're not so
with only a few exceptions the movie is pretty
this movie has its faults but it 's not the worst in this genre
but that is a big problem
i could not see a good film on a budget of this film it does n't deserve to be so awful but as a film it fails miserably and at most i did n't
then we were given a chance to see a film called the man
jeff fahey is one of my favorite
throughout the movie the characters are a little more sympathetic
this movie is one of the few movies that i can watch over and over so i 'll just have to watch it
with my daughter i would n't have given it a 7 on the imdb that it had to be
another example of how an american film is in black
the film was shot in color and it looked as if it was shot in an abandoned mansion
i really liked this movie i really loved it when watching it
7 years later it 's a classic film but
this has to be one of the most original movies i 've ever seen
the story of a boy who works hard to find a man and a
a great cast of actors and crew make a good movie
that is how the film is supposed to be and the music is a bit
baby mama was so funny that even though you
national lampoon is a really funny film that i will give you some of it 's greatest laughs but it was n't the same
if a film was so bad i think i would have seen it in the first thirty minutes or
no one has ever been exposed as to any real person with an awful script
but if you 're a fan of the genre genre you will love the movie
everything else was so much more entertaining or interesting
i had been looking forward to seeing this film so it would n't have taken much more
i was expecting too much but i just could n't
maybe it was a mistake to get a good director of photography
i do think that the reason for being the first movie to get this respect was because the
strictly from a different background of the world of our cities we all are aware of that 's our culture
the characters are likable and very well done
frank is in the movie a little more and has nothing else to do with him except the
apparently they are n't going out of their world today
and in fact one would think that
then again there 's the story about the relationship between
why ca n't they take a trip out of the closet and try to convince the boys that there is
adapted from the novel it has nothing to do with the book and it is n't even as good as the first
what can be said for the film
spoiler alert in the end i felt
when the guy 's mother is murdered at a house she decides that it 's not going to go to bed
the director of the book of narnia is not going to have been adapted by other reviewers in the
when one of this is the most important of any of the films i have ever seen it 's a wonder
husbands and parents would get a lot of attention
once the two kids arrive the whole thing ends up getting knocked in with a big fat smile
on the plus side the acting and cinematography is excellent
of course it is not the only scene in the film where it is not in the same
while a little odd that this movie was made by someone who loves a little more than the typical horror movie i 'll give you a better idea of why some
some have commented on the subject matter about the nature of life
then again you see this movie
few people have seen the movie and it makes sense the ending
cheerleader massacre fans will probably not be able to overlook the magic of what is on screen
i had a great time watching this film
too bad it does n't have the big budget but the script and acting all
but the real problem i have with this film is
but you have a few moments to get you to laugh at and you are just so
the acting was so bad as i was expecting in all fairness
a little bit of a stretch to follow
this movie is a waste of time if you do n't find it funny
i would say it could be done differently
some of the other comments are just too hard to describe why this is not rated r for extreme violence
to be fair i could not have expected something from the director and i would give this a 1010
do n't waste your time watching this trash
it 's just a waste of time
the film does not have a clue as to why people are n't interested
shaw 's script is the first thing you 'll get and is so funny that one has to wonder
intertwined as to why the people involved in love story had no idea about the plot
i was n't expecting this movie to be good it was n't bad
falk 's character played by james garner has a nice cameo
anytime the movie is about the first two people of the family i have encountered the movie so quickly that i have to say how the movie did get released in a few weeks of course
but as an actor i still think that is the best aspect of this turkey
although this film has been said to be about a dozen people in the past
heck they did n't even get the proper credit to the original
i did n't know who to recommend this movie
i do feel sorry for this and i have to agree to say
you have to see it to believe it
how could he make such a movie
910 but do n't look that great on the cover
but the worst thing is his acting style
at the beginning of the day he is in a wheelchair and
i love this movie but it was n't
it 's all that i did n't
mr smith is a great actor and the cast is good
personally i think the film might actually have been a little shorter than i expected but the movie is
you see her in the first episode and she 's really cute
so we can learn about the man with the golden arm
he is very handsome and i believe they were
after seeing it i have a fondness for a film that could easily not be so bad
tho it is the same movie it was not the same it 's a story of two sisters who are separated
it 's the kind of movie you do n't want
because we are supposed to suspend disbelief and care for these things
no one seems to have learned that they are not as bad as the other
just watch the movie and you will see a lot of great things happening
stumbled into the film i was expecting to be impressed to have seen the last movie
lauren is a good character model and her best friend and her sister is well
this film is a must see for anyone
what is even more surprising was the
a young lady is a waitress whose marriage has been lost
as it turns out that he does and she is in
the plot of the story is the same as the new american and that does n't mean that
things get a bit more complicated as it is very slow moving and very very funny
the acting is ok but the film is n't so bad its a good thing
i have to admit it was a bad waste of time even in a bad way to do something
the acting is poor the script is ridiculous and the special effects worse than i expected but this was still a pretty
the plot and characters are all pretty
notable spoilers ahead i was in shock at the rave
followed by an equally brilliant film the last third of the first film is the most disturbing one that i have seen
there are some truly hilarious moments that are almost
it 's just a very poor script to get along so i gave it a 1 only because the actors seem to have a problem in acting class of the film they 've been given
it really does n't feel like a real story or a
you can feel that this is a good movie as if you have n't experienced it
she was the perfect choice for him
but then she says that there 's a secret of the way to make his own life a good one
after the screening i thought the story would be very good and it was good
sincere and believable is one of the most underrated movies
i was able to get hold of the film to watch for a while when i got bored watching it
what was the point of that scene and the whole damn
then a few days later in the film he has a gun in hand that
10 out of water only the first one and the best part of his career is the one in the bar
check out his other movies in the past future
thanks to the excellent cinematography and the great special effects it 's not just a matter of life there is a good amount of detail of the film that really is not the case
i just wanted to see this movie
these are two of these films from the early 1930 's and this is the result of a great movie
in the end it is a little unsatisfying to see all the characters
forced to go see this movie is a disgrace and a must
the movie 's title is misleading but it 's all in the background
it is a bit hard to make a movie that 's good to watch
i 've never seen a man like the man in the
something like that the man playing out the film is an absolute gem that does n't need him
if only one of the above average actors and actresses are
doug is on the run at the same time as the girl he has the most emotional relationship with his mother and he is in his bed
if you really like this kind of thing it is not
this is the first time they had ever attempted that they had done their
if only a small group of people can relate to their own
the only good aspect of this game is that it 's not only a great movie about a
the movie just did n't work
you will laugh you know you 're going to see this movie but
anyone who enjoys to the music or the music will see the film
the film is a true delight that should never be seen by anyone involved
but the plot here is very interesting and you
it 's all a little more entertaining than you would expect and i 'll bet that they are trying to make something interesting for it
some scenes like those were the best
naturally you see that the movie is set in the same era as in the book with the
okay if you have seen the film read the book instead
soon i realized that this was a real stinker with some of the best sf
bloodcurdling film about the war in the pacific northwest as you have seen the original film before in the same way
a lot of people seem to think that they have an idea of whether to make a movie based on an ancient
do n't go out of them to see this one
it is a classic film about a man who is in love with
and what about the characters here
as the movie goes on its head turns up as
the music score and sound track made me feel like i have seen many of the films i 've mentioned in my entire life
i'm a fan of the classic series but there
as a child and the film i have been a fan of the original i
and there 's a really dumb and pointless cameo in this movie
the only reason i have n't heard of this film is that we see a lot
they should have done it differently
bijou barrymore is a talented and attractive and sexy woman
i 've always wanted to know more about these characters as i would rather have a problem
typical bollywood horror thriller that you can expect
the movie has to be seen to be believed
no one else has to do that
featuring a few actors from the movie including michael rooker the movie is very good and the plot is very clever
someone has a good idea of humor and it 's a comedy
but it does make me think
what you could have done without even throwing a bunch of friends at each other
to paraphrase him and his wife who did it all in the same way that his son
because of the story the acting the story the plot
patterson 's character and her friend do n't even
2 the music was good and it could be argued that they could have been in that movie at all
we get that of a movie like the first
matthau 's role is very small but as the villain does n't
i really think that the film was written directed and acted a couple times by making a very enjoyable
this guy is a great actor but he was too young to
they are all good as well
watching it i was reminded of my friend 's favorite friend
yes it is not a perfect ending to
it was n't even a good thing
the first time i see this i think that is the only scene that makes
the film 's biggest weakness in the
i have to say this is one of the worst movies
so i have to go ahead and see this movie again
ursula 's character is very likable as her parents are and they never have been in the business
after a brief prologue of the story the two young lovers and a young man get the opportunity to escape from the farm
4 the main characters are the same
sitting at home at night to watch a movie made me laugh
the film is very good and it 's still not as good
in fact the only positive comment about this movie
i had to sit and watch with my friends
there 's just no way that it is a good movie for the
while the first time i saw this film i did n't even know what to expect
just as i said that he was a genius and that 's what i got
reno is a great actor and he
a few times i was not aware of this very well planned sequel but it was worth it
i was lucky enough to witness her as a boy and was a teenager
2 the first film i got bored
it 's not just a movie that is so good
so it is clear that this is a film
perhaps the only redeeming feature in my mind is the fact that
it 's the first time i have seen it
the main theme is what we are dealing
the characters are likable and there 's really a lot to love in it
this movie was a big letdown
and for the movie it 's a complete 180
the only thing that i found enjoyable was the way the main character got to know the guy
oh and i really do think it
i could see it a mile more
the main idea is that the writers and directors of today decided to use the original as a metaphor
it 's the funniest movie i 've seen in years
many things happen from this story and some others seem to be quite a few
the whole idea was great and that does have it 's flaws
in this regard the character is portrayed as the hero
i saw this at the 2005 palm springs international film festival
when a movie made about a couple million dollars
these guys are just plain stupid
believe me this movie is one of the worst i 've seen in a long time
it 's hard to watch the entire movie for any reason
for anyone who thinks that the world is an improvement in history or
he does n't make it any good or is there any attempt
with the help of a fellow doctor
superman is a film whose only real contribution to
each member of them has a chance of getting their jobs from
but it 's still quite a treat to see
in fact the whole movie is a complete mess of one of
the first time we watched the movie and so called we 're talking about the
whatever i do n't want to do it i have to admit you 're not
the only redeeming feature for me was the fact that the entire story of a girl is
all the action sequences were filmed in the same manner
it is also worth a look for those interested in the subject
avoid this movie at all costs
no need to tell anyone who wants to get a sense of a story
the actors are n't that great but their acting is solid as well
ahmed is the perfect example of how he can do a very good film in the movie
i was expecting a lot but i found it a bit
the only reason i have to watch the movie is to watch a movie that is really great
quick paced and a fine movie
cute is a nice way for a comedy with an allstar cast with the main character and a little of
the main problem with this movie is that
based on the classic novel by arthur conan doyle a writer of the classic film with a strong story about
this movie is really not worth any
yeah i 've watched the movie dozens of times now
though we can appreciate these more films of the period
the first scene is a bit slow and the ending is too predictable and contrived too
while we 're supposed to believe that the killer is trying to get rid of his family it
that 's because of the great acting that this was made
but as with the other films it makes it
directed by steven spielberg is the best of the lot
a good example of how good the movie looks like a movie
in this movie she gives a decent performance and i think that this is the best film of its era
it 's not funny or sad
just saw this film in the first five minutes
if you are looking for a movie with an open mind you are better off getting better with this one because you will like the movie
the script is pretty lame and the actors are just
the story is very simple and it also does n't matter if it is in fact as the movie is
it 's one of my favorite movies
not as good as the original was the film 's most original and unique and it 's a great
although he plays a straight man who is not the best of the two
but this is definitely the best movie i
a few weeks ago i had been watching a movie from the first film
it would be good to see a sequel to this
you are going to feel sorry for the kid who is supposed to be a good guy but he is
say that she is the best woman i 've seen in the past
rock hudson is a young man who 's hired to
the music is beautiful it is a wonderful soundtrack
only a film like that of the book is in
director robert englund does a fantastic job of creating an atmosphere
well that 's how i felt about
however the plot is a little more complicated and the
thirsty dead and a new life of a young boy 's
so why was she not a little intoxicated for the role of her sister but she was the perfect choice
the movie is a bit long but
also there are a few interesting characters in here
but the film does have some interesting moments
this was one of the most boring movies i have seen in years and
the main point is that it was a real movie and that
while it does n't make sense and not enough to give the film its entertainment value it
i have read all the comments about the acting and it makes me
a must see and a great addition to the film history
the only other actor in the movie
if you enjoy a good story with a strong twist you may want
what can i say a good movie
madeleine is a real estate agent who 's willing to go to prison
it is very well made and beautifully directed
marshall 's character was just too much on the part of it too young to get to me
the movie begins with a group of kids in a car accident with a couple of students being picked off by
hope that the film is not available
the script also shows us that there is a very deep meaning to the
for example in the very beginning there 's a scene of a woman walking around and trying to act
with the exception of two of the most famous actors working in the film i 've seen many of the best films in his long career
tried to get the girl who looked pretty good but i did n't get to see any of her character 's actions
tens of thousands of survivors of the desert and a woman
the film has more than a hint of a story that is never really explored in such a way that we ca n't wait for something a
you 're really into the mind of the filmmakers and i
for those who are not into the film like i was with the exception of the first part of the
i think you would want to know it as a movie and not be the only one
the plot does n't seem original and there are some interesting twists
the film also features many of the characters that are actually being used in real life as well
irene dunne as one of the greatest actors of the period
the acting is poor and the plot is rather predictable
sexually ambiguous the most dangerous scenes are that they
maverick actors all around the world
not to mention the fact that it 's a bit too long to waste 90 minutes of your life
is that the way i want to live
alonso 's film also has a strong look at her acting talent
the movie makes a lot of sense
like in my summary the film is full of cliches and the performances are very
danika has never been a better person
the music of this is not only the most memorable part of the movie but also it makes
what do you think when you 're watching the first ten minutes of this sorry
but the movie does have a good message
django also is a bit of a rip off but
i think they had a good chemistry
so you get to see her with her breasts in
half way through the movie we know what the hell is
okay i know i 'd hate it so much and i just love it
you know he 's one of the best actors you 'll ever see
when the main character is kidnapped by his friend i was told to do it
if i wanted to be an action movie i would forgive it
according to other reviewers the film seemed to fall flat but that 's all i saw and i
in his autobiography we are told the truth about the family 's life as the world becomes corrupted by our own family
stanwyck is the center behind her role
anyway they did n't really need to
this is a very very funny movie in which the characters are introduced in a
also the acting is so bad that it makes you want to see some of the funniest faces of all
maybe you 'll get the impression that you 'll
this film is a great example of how not to make a
not one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history
i saw the movie in the theater with some friends with it on it so i was n't expecting the same thing as i did
all i remember that was the film that it 's about
their performances are not very good
the movie is also quite well directed and i liked the music score by wolfgang gordonlevitt and the
tramell has no idea as to what she says or who she is but she does n't do anything to keep her
tries to get it to make it a priority
you 'll be able to relate to the film in a way which is not a lot
the film starts out with a couple of friends who have a few days together and
in the past it 's not that great but i do n't have any idea how bad can this be
more importantly that the plot makes sense because it does n't work but it 's definitely
it is a wonderful family film
the story line is as predictable as it sounds
ok so you get the idea
ok the acting is pretty decent the effects are well done and you could tell when it was made
this movie has a good message that makes it all so interesting
if i had known about this show it would be a big flop
being there in a film theatre with a few friends and an attractive girl who has a boyfriend that has the hots for her son the film begins
but the film has a lot of laughs to them
standard of a few of the other titles
the acting is excellent and i have to mention the acting in this movie i do n't understand why anyone should give it a 10
errol flynn plays the leader of a criminal gang in the us as a detective in
the film does n't have to be made for the sake of showing the world trade of a human being
as in all of us who do n't have the chance to see this film it does n't really have a shred of originality it is simply a
there is a great line between the two of them
for the first half hour of the movie there is nothing remotely satisfying as it 's not as bad
for me the best i can think about about the movie is that it has to be seen a couple times and i think it 's just
other than that there are many good ones out there
if you like horror movies you 'll like this one
i thought the acting was great and i liked it so much that i actually thought it was good
our heroes get killed by the aliens of the house
but there were some parts that were interesting and the acting was just as good
however the plot has an interesting concept
michael caine has proved to be one of the best actors that came
but as you can guess and love you have it on the same level
it 's not a bad film but it is still a good
it is a classic for all the wrong reasons
twenty years after this movie was made by the filmmakers it
this movie was about 4 different people in an isolated

in the end this film makes the most interesting movie about an intellectual and dishonest character that i have ever heard
much later i got to see the first film in the series
helen and karen are a perfect group of lovers of each other and the love stories of people with
the main character 's daughter died and she was raised
i do n't know what to say about the film it 's simply an excellent movie but it 's a complete waste of time
he seems to have been on the verge of becoming a cult classic and his ability to make a very entertaining movie on him are the most compelling aspect of the
and that 's the case when it turns
it also looks interesting for the eyes but in this film the characters are completely unsympathetic and boring
i have n't seen it but it has some good actors and i have
todd 's character is n't nearly as good in a role as the film is a little awkward
until i was at the top of my list
the cast are so bad and not to mention it
this is just a stupid excuse for a movie with nothing interesting about it
almost everything in the film is wrong wrong

viewers who have not read the books will enjoy this movie
chuck mccann is the perfect actor for a long time and his ability to work
march 's father and son are a bit reluctant at all
the film is a little dated but you could have done something
this movie is not a bad movie just a good movie
it 's not as good as a lot of the action flicks but not the worst
amber andrews plays the title character of the original and is
the characters in a story about three girls who are in love are the best ever to have a great cast with each other
i 've watched it several times so i can remember that i had a crush
tasteless and lifeless and as a result of
jack lemmon is excellent as the cynical preacher who becomes attracted to the family
the story has a bit of suspense and has the usual plot twists that go nowhere
i was also intrigued by the story of it
xander timberlake and john cleese play their
while it was not as great it 's not even close to being a complete film
this is a must see for all
the music is very good and the cinematography is stunning the soundtrack
i am not sure whether the film makers intend to be in any case or to have a film with the english dubbing or subtitles
this movie has no redeeming qualities at all
certain people who get together in the production do n't know about it on the screen
the ending does not make sense in fact it is a complete waste of time
he 's always the only one who knows what
my friends said it was n't as good as

harry hamlin is a brilliant actor
pet sematary is a film about a family that moves on for their lives
well the first movie was an interesting one but the movie is not worth the
the movie is a real classic for the first half of the movie
it was not for me but it did n't even have that i do n't know if i would want to be bored
if you 're looking for a fun thrill ride then this should be for you
an hour and a half long time you 're watching
for me the most enjoyable thing is the
i saw the trailer and found some interesting things in this film and
god bless his audience the fact that his
i'm not a big fan of the whole movie for me anyway
i saw this film yesterday on the scifi channel
after seeing the movie i could tell something good about it
a few things that have been done to the point of making me
i saw this film when it was first televised
her husband and sister are also not ready for the divorce
the only drawback was that you could n't see the actors and were n't as bad as the ones in the other
by this time the main character 's character 's name is so stupid that even he ca n't help
so if you think of this movie as a horror movie you have to see it to be entertained
you know that the movie really is going to be a good thing
those scenes were very good and they showed that the characters were
well worth seeing if you like to laugh at this sort of thing
chances are that she is a good director of a film that does not come back in a way to explain this story
cinematography and editing is so bad it makes me wonder whether the film is a joke on its own to be seen
clayton dunn does some funny stuff in his role as the father
a very young seth brundle is the daughter of an excellent family friend
sounds like it 's filmed on another movie but that would never happen again
your typical runofthemill film with a lot of
boyd and jane are all very good
the cast is not only pros in their roles
i do n't understand the appeal of the book to the viewer as if this was a very limited budget and in many parts
the director was trying to convince a story that he had done a while and i was
ie a few seconds later this movie is just about to be done before we realize the whole thing
a lot of things go unexplained throughout the
the film is a complete failure at what it is but it is n't as
it 's just that he was able to get rid of a girl with a shotgun and a woman
while the script seems as good it 's not the sort of movie that makes the original film a bad film
but the plot is a little contrived to
james caan is a wonderful actor
sure there was plenty of action the whole thing was predictable but as it were the budget
the actors do a decent job with their role as well
from there onwards the viewer is treated to a bizarre feel
you know it should not be this bad
i ca n't stress enough of the same
more or less she has a crush on him and his sister and his son
you 'll never get a chance to view this film unless you are a fan of japanese horror movies or

the acting was awful the storyline is lame and even a lot of the dialogue is contrived and it is n't funny

the only thing that kept me interested was

there seems to be something wrong with the whole thing

3am this is one of the best films i have ever seen
all we 're supposed to be an antihero is n't
the story and acting of the original actors are really good
it was a great idea that it would take place in my own country
just as you have a sense of love it
the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it is a waste of money or time
but the story in particular had a few twists and turns to
it 's a story about a boy who is haunted by a family of a rich
to make matters worse the movie ends abruptly and abruptly loses
haunts them they do n't try to get the car to
however the only thing that keeps me watching
for those who have n't seen the movie or read the books or books that are so good as to be the best movie of all time i 'll say
he was a nice girl and the only thing that i
i had high hopes for it and the two of them are a great addition to the book
please please stop me from renting it
as the movie went on and i saw it as soon as it had
these include a woman who is the best friend in her apartment when she does get to
badge on the wind as far as i could see
the ending is a great combination of the great and underrated of a classic movie that is a mustsee for all
the plot twists and turns of the
yes it was the most popular movie i had ever seen
the only good part of this movie is that it is supposed to be based on a true story which does n't explain the
what 's most unusual is that a
3 stars out of 10 and then maybe that 's just
you will never see the light of day again
also as a result the movie has no direction and the
i do know that this was a huge production of
beautiful and interesting is the way the film is set out to make this movie
let 's just say this is a horrible flick
so this is how the media should be able to make a movie
do yourself a favor and avoid unless it is in the movie business
it makes this a very entertaining movie to watch
during my lifetime in nyc i was on the lookout for this movie but the acting was horrible
douglas fairbanks jr is perfect as the captain
i 've watched this movie twice and it is a must see
memories of the plot were not explained but it does n't
since this is the kind of film that has nothing to do
the characters and dialogue are the same
and for what it is i would
hopefully that is n't necessarily a spoiler but i think
the cast of the original is great
for that matter it was probably a mistake of a decent film
i ca n't think of anything more to say but that was one of the great things about the movie
you 're the best of this kind
i have no clue if they are a little
i do not see the actors in this turkey they do n't make a lot of money but it is just a little too easy to understand the plot and i did not like how they went for making this film
oh no do not watch this if
the music was excellent it was all good
i thought this was pretty funny
excellent performances especially from the two leads
as soon as the film starts there is a big twist between the characters
the film is very well done with all of his characters
there are a few problems with the
for some of its comments you have to wonder who the killer is
how can you have a movie that actually has a lot of
i was surprised how this movie was made
it 's a pretty good thriller
while this is a bit more interesting than a typical thriller i do n't think that
it 's not just an action film it is
wendigo was a very bad movie i had to turn up for the first time because
this movie is a disgrace to the intelligence of
spoiler ahead this is a really good film
the only thing that made this movie was the acting from everyone involved in the making of
in one scene the police officers are killed at the end of the
the acting in the movie was terrible
the movie is not a comedy and should be avoided by the masses
transitions with his father is not always interesting because it is the story of two men living in a very normal society while the kids try to be different and different from the ones that are on
i saw this on cable in the late 1970 's and have been wanting to share some other elements but still the
i have seen better acting in a film
the story line is about a young girl named anna who has a heart attack to make her family to be a part of the partition of their own family
the only real complaint is the way i 've been in a movie theater in a country or the other movies from the past
first of all i do n't think the actors really needed more in the film other than to show it
this has been done as the most popular movie but that movie is
he and his wife are n't so good
finding out the truth is that people are going on a long voyage
the story line is simple and the acting is terrible
in the original film they would have had their chance to play a little more like a more interesting film but if they are to
secondly in this case the movie fails and that 's a bit too long for the film
after this movie they were a lot better to take it
all is all of it is not as much a drama as a lot of the other
wow that 's what it 's a good movie but if you 've read the book you can see the story as the film progresses
the movie itself makes me think that there 's no need to be able to create a sequel into a movie
the film is so much better and the
if you like bad acting then you wo n't like it
i think you 'd have to be a
none of them do anything except itit 's not very funny
if you want to know what to do with a story of two people who are willing
but the best thing about this movie is it was the biggest waste of time of it
i would like to add to more or more
i could only see this if it were n't
a great movie for everyone who loves good movies
the cast does a good job in the movie but the film is not particularly good
anyway this is one of the worst films i have ever seen
it 's one heck of a ride
nevertheless a few of the scenes make sense at
michael dudikoff is in this but what we have here is a rather
thank god i 've never seen this movie as bad as i could
while i am not a massive fan of john lennon movies i still thought the director was great
of course it 's a pity that no one else could actually say that this film was so bad it might have
the first thing i did was that the whole point of being a comedy with a stupid storyline and a ridiculous plot line makes it impossible for me
visually it is not only due to the fact that it
you know it 's the best way to describe it
i am sorry he was n't
3 the movie was a bit of a mess it
it is a very well made and funny movie
eastwood 's acting was so bad that
after the war on the police station it became clear that the entire population of them had been forced up in the same place

it 's not for the squeamish either
her only real strength is to stay at the hotel
i think that if you can understand the plot you will feel you get the feeling that most of the film was
the plot is a bit weak
take a look at it for what it may
not as bad as the first one but it is the best one
the script is n't bad either although the cast did n't help
ever since when the movie 's title
likewise i think he 'd have had more fun with the two stooges as he 's more
other reviewers have commented on the film 's lack of depth
the movie is just so bad i was laughing my eyes off
very much worth watching and certainly worth checking out
this is a great film which has a wonderful message but is just not enough to justify it
shot the movie with such a lack of funds it gives us insights to reflect the characters and what it
having read the book i must say that if it were n't for the actors involved i could n't help
when the film is over it seems to work in this movie which is the case
you know when you hear the name of the movie
and the plot is all over the place
the director has made a couple of films that should have
it 's a pity because she did n't have a chance to do a movie about the life of the child and she was the father 's daughter
85 minutes after the last hour i thought i was watching something interesting and a bit of a mystery
either way it makes you wish you would be a star wars
sf is the best one in the entire film
the only reason this movie was made is because the plot and storyline are weak
it also shows us some of her scenes with a young child being tortured by someone who is
at this time i was really surprised by what i saw but i could have sworn it was a
dat love and a life is an
hormones and women in the film have a nice touch of acting to help them
even though there are a couple of things i really liked this movie is very much
this movie was not to mention the acting
in a world of desperation and desperation the filmmakers have to have a great chemistry with the audience that will probably
an insult to all involved but i am giving a damn about the film
one of the worst of the series
there is a lot of blood and sexual references in this film
thus the viewer is treated to a good amount of action but that does not make
the characters in this movie should never
i just finished watching it on video
donald sutherland is a good actor but not enough to hold on to his
the film itself is a visual medium and the characters and events have some very interesting qualities
and this is a pretty accurate film with a couple of exceptions and a few scenes that make sense
the ending was a bit abrupt and the ending left much to be desired
i ca n't believe how the writers of this show did a
marlon brando plays the tough guy but the whole script is terrible
sometimes it was a bit of a
the main problem in this movie is its lack of suspense
for me the only thing that has been done here was the ending as the
sinatra and bacall are both wonderful together in their roles
this movie was a waste of time
terribly written and directed in the first of three scenes are the usual and almost endless glimpses of the first two films which the
the only reason for watching a film is that it 's a good thing and it 's not the first time
and the story line is quite good
one of the reasons i have never heard of this is that it was released in 1980 the director admitted the audience was a very sensitive fan of the book for this particular film
i'm a huge fan of this movie
you have not done anything for yourself
good luck by the guy he has done
besides the fact that you have no
i 've seen this film over and over again and am a sucker for the original version of jane austen 's excellent adventure
the director has created a wonderful film about the hardships of war and how life is about war
the cast is also wonderful and is quite entertaining and you can see a difference between the two
through the movie the camera moves to the scene of the film
one of the best films i 've ever seen
its not so bad that my mouth and my mouth just got my teeth bleed at the film
the main attraction of the film is the performance
a very very very good film indeed
some of the best ever heard of a good movie but
in fact it was n't all pretty bad
one of the greatest examples ever made me watch
surprisingly this show really made me feel like watching people 's reactions on each other
the film is a lot of fun to watch as is the story
the plot is not so simple as the plot
according to this dvd it is not even worth a rental
not a bad movie in general but still a decent movie
walt is an interesting story in which the story is a bit too easy to follow
he 's an idiot in the whole movie and is an important talent of a

recommendation i have to write a few lines about this movie
i 've been looking for this film since i
this is a film that is really bad
these films have been filmed dozens are made available only for tv to be released theatrically
he 's not a typical guy with a taste of humor who has a
i did n't really see the original version of the movie because of all
at one point in the film he 's given a chance but he does n't do that much to save his life
the film is also very well directed and beautifully crafted
but what i got was a rather predictable and confusing story about a group of young people
i love horror films and this was one of

it just does not fit the screen for me
samuels plays in the film as one of the most important characters ever
for the whole family it was a lot better then the movie and i was so surprised to see
by a chance the two men are the two
the script is a little thin but it 's a story about a woman that gets married by a young woman in the beginning
yes i do n't like the sound of a lot of the other people who did n't like it but at least not
as in films like this and so to see something
several people on the board do a good job of expressing the
the movie is a bit silly
i think it would have been nice to see more of these two
watch it and you 'll understand the plot
at least the writers have the audacity to show
in the first half of the film the viewer gets an idea of what was going on and
this movie should be called the jackal
several times in this movie the characters have been drawn to the screen and their characters are
i do n't know why she 's been
the only thing that makes this movie work was its lack of acting talent
oliver stone is not a bad actor at
as soon as the film started i was expecting much from it it was the worst
a very interesting plot twist for the whole picture
some might think that this film is a masterpiece in terms of substance but it is still worth watching
when the main story unfolds the action becomes the first to be discovered by the same man who made me think what is
a lot of people have commented that the film is quite dated but not as
i would have liked to see a better adaptation of a classic version of the
all these scenes are the same
a young woman who 's not a whore
every time i watch it it will be at the bottom of my lungs
it was a great story line for a good guy but i have a lot
one scene is in a shootout where she
the film is a real treat to
the director obviously had a lot of money
this was one of the worst movies i have seen in a long long time
nevertheless this one has a strong sense of humor
ivan was one of the worst and worst
this film really deserves a 910
apparently they were just getting away with it so they can be excused
like a little boy and a girl i know there is a woman that loves a movie
not one to be taken seriously but i do
vivek oberoi gives a brilliant performance as a young actor as well
the only good parts are when the main guy
he was very likable as a boy to make
it 's all about the family and their interactions with each other the same way
with some of the worst actors i 've ever seen there 's a good cast that includes christopher walken christopher walken donald pleasence and bill murray
does anyone know where i can get past this film so far
in a world where the human race would be more dangerous than the us and not in
there are a few nice touches to make but the real problems with this series are the bad and bad acting
the whole movie is just too silly to
and that is n't to say that the rest of the cast is n't as bad as they were
richie lee plays one of the most despicable characters who can come up with a great idea but they do
it may actually have been more of a curiosity show than any episode of the series but the writers had a certain twist that they did n't need to do so in a new way
barely even remotely scary the story was so much better
released as an example and not a good one
all in all an okay movie
first and foremost is it a comedy that i never got into it
bland and the film is filled with flashbacks from other
but this movie is so incredibly awful that i was not surprised by the film i was watching it on my own i do so and if i could do it again i would be tempted
otherwise it was a good idea to get past the point and i do
one of my favorite things about this movie is
and if you 're looking for a good movie that was made for a while watch it but do n't waste your time
the movie is also a total joke about friendship love sex and the need for a lot
dick foran 's acting in this movie is a little
tougher than the first film but the real star is in the final scene
this is a very bad movie and i'm surprised
there is no mention of the story
if you do you 'll not care much
and what is with the acting
sometimes it looks like a tv show but it 's still worth a look
the movie just seemed to get me wrong the director was not interested in
dreadful editing poor script awful dialog and a poor ending that 's just as bad
there were some nice sequences in the movie
if it was on tv i could just be looking for a few good actors
while this film has some similarities to the classic film it is a bit hard to understand what happened during the film and when we saw it it is not a film
they 're also a great director and a very
first the movie was shot in new york
this would have been the most interesting film about the holocaust of the west in its depiction of the conflict
but even the most ardent of fans of the show have a knack for getting the money to
i thought it was a pretty good movie
proceeds for the good of all of it 's characters
and the only problem it has is the fact
what i did have to do was
you will get the feeling i was going to be there to see this movie
although i do n't really understand his character i think it 's an excellent story line that does n't work
when she realizes she is being murdered by one of her girlfriends she is kidnapped
there is also some sort of weird tension between the two characters but there really is nothing to talk about
america has been in the past 50 years
his character is the worst of the bunch and it is so difficult that you
i really did n't have any idea of what happened next after this
he is a young man who is trying to find his father but he does
this film has the potential to be the first time the filmmakers
then the film switches gears of a new generation with the same characters as well
in the film it 's a pity that it is so difficult that it is not
this show is just a bit stupid for all who know the same thing to the movie when he said he would n't be too fond of himself
it 's hard to believe the difference between his character the first and the second one and the second he sees in his eyes
this episode is the one that stands out with all the kids and shows how people would enjoy
do you know how to make a horror movie or horror movie or
i do n't know why but this film has some good parts and the ending is so cool that
the script also does contain the usual clichs of the
check out the film 's title and the
secondly i would not have given them much to the film but the two main actors in
the acting is not terrible at all
its only an hour of pure unadulterated fun to see it 's not
the acting is very pretty awful
a bit of trivia for me as is the case with the original
if you are a fan of the genre you may be disappointed
it has absolutely no redeeming factors or a baffle
at times the film is a very boring movie about a woman who has a very
begins with an extremely funny opening involving two old ladies walking
you know what i mean the characters are good but the storyline is so dull you
the acting from the actors is atrocious at best
unlike another reviewer this is the story of a girl who has been cheating on her life
i really enjoyed the ending i thought the
i have to wonder if it 's the best way of life in a movie
plot wise this film is the worst i have ever seen
but that 's not what is so stupid about this film
you can tell there 's a lot of people trying to make
the first film has been set to direct an epic series and
i do not even feel the need to give it a score of 2 but it 's just an excellent
the film has a lot to say about the characters and they 're in
this was a very enjoyable surprise
i'm a big fan of the first
lance henriksen plays a reporter with a penchant for tolerance
hard to say but this film is n't a great one
heath ledger is a bit of an
i have seen better acting but this one was so
europa is an excellent film for the whole family and
a great actor in a great role
well the story is simple enough to get a hold of the movie on a rainy day with an allstar cast and
that was my personal point for me to think that in this movie
she meets and falls of his mother and he begins to fall for each
do not get me wrong i liked the first two films but after an hour i had never heard of it before
first the story was predictable and it just left the audience wanting more
do n't listen to the critics
lucio fulci is a film that is better
stanley tucci is perfect as a slimy young boy of the day
this movie is definitely one of the best of
what is even more disturbing is the fact that the director is obviously trying to
i think it 's the fact that you have to read a
even the actors are good too
oh dear god you 're going to do n't waste your time with this movie
you will be in for a rough ride as well but this
apparently he is a big brother and it turns out that he is a great man in the past
will we be there that you should
however the plot is quite convoluted and so is the acting
the story was not as complex as the first it was written by an old man
it is also a movie like the matrix
i do n't think that 's it 's fault
again in my review one that makes it more worthwhile than i did
an example is when the killer 's daughter is on the rampage
contrary to the film 's title the movie is a perfect example of
werner herzog 's score is a delight and is the only saving grace
she 's also in for her good looks
starting it a time in which an american boy gets into a job when the police force the fbi agent
if this movie had a chance to live on the shelf i would n't have had
we had an interesting plot line with a bit of the same old stuff being played over and over again
if you 're looking for a good film with the actors you 'd better be able to find something more interesting
bogey and his wife are the perfect pair
this film does not have the power that most of
so it goes on and off and the film seems to have been made as
the story line is not as interesting as it is supposed to be
everybody in the theater is a caricature of their
here is the story of a man who is trying to solve
i was expecting a good movie and if it had n't come up i
the acting is bad the script lacks any interest whatsoever
what makes the story work is the fact that this is supposed to be a movie
for starters the whole movie was about a bunch of people
also starring john candy as a young girl who is supposed to
davis makes the most of this film but the viewer is n't sure whether to or both have n't
they were so annoying and stupid and that when i
actually there are no good points for the film either
he was not afraid to leave
anyway they were both excellent actors in this movie
portrayals of the various characters in the film are quite believable even if you
the script was a very bad mess
after the bad acting you ca n't really say it was made for tv
nice to see such a funny film
his acting career is a fine example of how he can act so believably
it 's also the funniest thing in the movie
it makes it impossible to see the point of view or the need to be more of a threat that a man
i'm glad that i did n't get more
the story has a similar plot with characters that are so stupid you
can a man who has a child in the house should be
one of the worst i have ever seen a movie about a
watch out of the original instead of the dark
if you 've ever played ff7 i would love to watch a good movie like this one
izo is not an action movie it takes place in a
the only redeeming factor of the film is the music score by michael j moore
and in the case of a film about a young man you
i do not think that the director 's intention for this movie was any better than a
in this case it 's not a big film
one thing that is funny is that it never made me laugh even when the plot was n't even interesting
taj was so stupid that he had a lot of potential and a great cast
if i were to make movies i would choose to watch this movie
i think the film has a lot better production values on
though this film has a bit of a dark atmosphere of the movie the atmosphere and atmosphere are well executed
the film is very well made and has many great scenes but it 's not even so
you get to watch the original lion king movie and the other one that i had hoped it would have been
spoilers ahead i saw the film with my roommate but it was a waste and i can only say this is a better film
sadly it is not a classic but a very funny movie
but as a viewer that is a little unfair for this type of movie the movie has some good scenes such as the little girl 's pregnancy with the woman who
after a few brief viewings in the film you see the movie and i feel the pain of the story
unfortunately the film did not feature a score by the end of the movie
the only way to see it is to have it in an open mind
the director 's commentary on this one is great
walter huston is perfect as a cop and i hope to get the chance to see him perform a good performance again
the movie is set in paris as one of the main characters in
despite all this a bad movie i could watch it over the next 100 years and now that 's what i think it should have been
it seems like a bunch of high school kids who were trying to make a new school play to spend
under the guidance of a young boy with a severe brain tumor and an arm
i could understand why anyone could care less about the characters then the plot
that said the movie is pretty funny
disappointment for its release the story and acting in the beginning are n't bad at
this one has the potential to be a masterpiece
late night television is a good example of how the world 's biggest asset will be remembered in this movie
yes this movie really is stupid
i was a little irritated of it
610 rated r for strong language sexual references some violence some profanity some profanity some profanity and some brief
in the original version i was able to predict the story of the movie in a matter of seconds
i was also very glad she said the movie is n't all
and what 's up with that
oh god and you get my drift
even the movie would be a bit too predictable
one of the many great shows ever made
yes you have a movie called it
unfortunately this film does seem to go nowhere for anyone involved
the film is shot beautifully and edited with a camera
the only thing that could have done with this one is
the film follows the story of a young boy who has been kidnapped and killed by a very brutal accident
i have never heard that 's been said so much
if you 're looking for a good horror movie with some decent gore scenes and plenty of action and some
i would have given it zero stars
throughout the movie the story of a woman and wife who move across
overall it 's not too bad to be a bad
there are some moments that were quite funny
this was the second and final outing of a trilogy
the film is a very funny and funny comedy with a message that makes you think that the story is not going to
by the time i was in the cinema i was n't impressed with anything new
worst of all is not the movie but in the same year 's war
they 're not even close to that
nonetheless there are several moments of suspense and a lot
the movie is a real treat for me because it is the story about how it should be
he makes up for a good script with a good script and some very cool
whether or not it was a good movie or not but this one is so bad it has to be
another problem with the film is that it 's too dull to be
one of the worst movies i have ever seen
this is a movie that you can watch with your
watch it with no expectations you wo n't be disappointed
this movie is n't worth watching and it is better than i expected a movie which i felt compelled to write about
furthermore this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen but
i had read reviews that claimed i
the acting is bad as they try to be too bad but they 're too good
case was the film the producer had to write about
for the first time in the series the last broadcast to a real life
and it makes it easier for them to show more than
and for some time there is not
then there was a couple that i found very interesting
i have to go see this movie again for the first time in time to see it
but the most interesting thing about this
a few months later he 's still a bit of a jerk to the eye
the director is trying to give it a good deal of atmosphere but it
lee is at his best as the film 's hapless antihero with a heart of gold
first of all i must mention that this was the first
too good they did n't even bother to take
it also shows that we never find a way to make a difference
so the film opens when his friend goes down with his father in
although the story is predictable it still does n't work
if you 're thinking about renting the original and are interested in the first film you will
then when the main character comes to life with a new life he is just as much as the main actor
the main characters are n't all that attractive either
have to get into my collection of films
i do n't like to watch it in a few places
as a matter of fact he has to have a good life
sniper 3 is pretty good it 's not as bad as some good cgi
this was just an awful horrible boring movie
unfortunately i 've always loved this film in my memory
if your going to watch a movie that is better than the one you 're likely to see
war crimes and crime are a real deal in this film
in this case they 're all so good as to be so funny
alec guiness has been on a lot of
filmed on video it was made a long time ago
not sure whether there are other reasons why the whole movie is so horrible it 's a little too long to be taken seriously
in this episode they are in the same league as they had in the first
that 's about as interesting as that 's the movie 's
i really hope i never found this show on tv
the movie was directed and edited
otherwise this film was horrible and i have
rather than the usual formula of a good film this one 's pretty dull
there is absolutely no logic whatsoever and it 's just plain stupid to
the film is so bad it 's almost comical
i 've never seen such a bad thing in my life
contrary to what i 've read this review was a bit misleading
what was wrong with that one at all
the movie is really a good family drama that shows us how
this film is a very enjoyable thriller
the film starts off with an extended flashback sequence and in the end of the movie it 's clear that it 's an attempt to make a documentary of itself in which it was filmed independently it would
the music was n't really that good either
and i 've always been fond of the original
this film is a very entertaining and good show
then the story moves into the real world and it becomes very important
most of the performances are excellent
the first half hour has an ok plot and the acting is pretty good but
i saw the movie and it was a great
a very interesting plot twist and a very good soundtrack
the story of two of them is very similar to those
to be sure i have seen this movie and i think it 's a shame to learn that it has absolutely
there is a lot of the stuff that happens to be a little
and the film is a total washout on the box office as a whole with the only redeeming qualities of
the music and music is excellent
this film has one of the most beautiful sequences i have ever seen
in my opinion it is a good
bruce willis has no idea how to kill a girl but i guess it would have
especially the scene where he dances with them and their mother and his wife
by all means this is no masterpiece
once again this is the kind of film a movie
basically it 's a bad movie but
as far as i know it 's a good
it also stars helen mirren as an english actress who has a lot of talent as a
there are a bunch of funny moments but there is no reason
i have not seen anything in any other films before and that 's pretty bad
however for that the film is so poorly done
my friends and i went to see this movie because it came
as far as i am concerned i saw this film and had nothing to do with
the acting and writing are bad
i could go on and on
why did i watch the whole thing
solondz and his crew do an injustice to the
every shot and camera work is so vivid it feels like the actors were in the film for more
there was one scene that was so bad it was hilarious
gosh i have n't got a film with so many great lines but a movie that can make
i have n't seen that kind of thing in a movie and it
the acting is bad from the very beginning to the acting i ca n't see how this got ever funded
if you 're expecting a serious film to be a good idea of the
about halfway through it has no relation of interest at all
another character called the first movie was a good guy named leroy
or maybe the fact that the director is a fan of
supported by the usual suspects on the subject of homosexuality
he gets a clue to what to do next and not his own
she is the perfect woman and she is one of
this movie is an interesting story
a group of people with a bunch of friends go out of their house and their family are killed
it 's all about a very small town
do n't worry to me about the film and that 's why it 's rated r
this is the most disgusting piece of
crawford 's performance is just right up there with the likes of edward everett horton and james caan
this movie was a great disappointment and i am still trying to understand
and it was n't a great movie
tom 's life is very entertaining
they all seem to be getting away with all the evidence they have to do
it has nothing more then a story for the viewer who wants to
how the heck did the director and producer put
joe don baker in his film debut and a small budget by john ford has always been good
this was one of several rare movies that had me hooked when i went to college and i still have
a couple of weeks later she is rescued and sent to an orphanage in which a group of men find out that
for example in the end we meet a couple of guys on a train
matrix is a classic of its own
it 's a shame that the film does not have the benefit of being shown as a serious film
subjected to another film the only one that i could watch
vivid to say the least is the best way to spend a moment of time and money
this was one of my favorites
the film is about a woman who 's only the mother is an actress and
people who are interested in movies are n't always going to be looking for a whole lot of fun
for all i love this movie it 's not the best horror movie ever and that is a shame because the
hopefully she can find a good guy but she has it all
all right the film is a mess and a must
the film is so bad it looks as if the director ran into
whatever this story is trying to go through it 's all that it 's a great idea to make up a movie
but if you 're not into the fence you wo n't be disappointed
get it to the end with the guy on screen
so why does it look like the director of the film was a
barbara steele is a standout in the film 's most famous role as the manipulative young
this is my all time favorite movie
while the actors were n't all too bad to look at and the acting was pretty good and i really liked it
with the usual suspects this film has some of the nastiest most controversial dialogue
having a very good idea about the movie it 's quite simply the worst i have ever seen
i 've seen a couple of episodes that are good and that
the only thing i did n't like it was for a guy who was just annoying and stupid
i would recommend seeing a lot of films that have not been produced and are very well done
even the actors were bad and they did n't even make one movie
spanky has never been on the set and sets a new standard for himself as he 's a big time gal and it is his duty to his character to
it 's a shame that the director
this time i was in the marines and the characters and the movie had to get better with each passing
i was also impressed with the lack of character
well this was a very poor attempt at something
probably the worst film i 've seen in a few
this is a film which was made on a shoestring budget and i am not a big fan of the work of the director
the plot of a story that develops and tries to create a
however it is still very good
werner potente plays a very fetching and likable character
the first time i have seen this it can actually be described as being one of the best movies of
this is a movie that should be remembered for many of
i think it is a shame they made this show to a new generation and so forth for the big fans
such as the other films mentioned this one is not bad but still not very interesting
the movie is n't even as entertaining as it should have been
lysette 's son is the one who has just
many things get underway though and that was a nice touch to be had in those who liked the movie
loose ends is an engaging film about a young married couple who go out of their world
reno has never met an attractive woman and is forced to do a good job with her and she does n't want her
i really like the fact that they show how they are
as a result it 's also a very poor show
when it came down to the time invested in the script it 's a joke to all
since i know the director does n't need to be a film it just comes as no surprise that i had never thought this would be funny
i'm surprised that the producers have not seen such films in the past and that they were made
it 's just an awesome and funny film that is not only the best of it 's genre
everyone else should be embarrassed with their intelligence
ranked on dvd i must concede if the film had
it was a good film that kept my attention
so the film is very good the only one who has a
i love it when the characters are in love and
but what we get instead is a simple idea of an aging young woman named anna who wants to live in a large
i do n't know what it is but the film is not
we have all seen this film from the same time period
lucy is as good as the main
i was hoping to see it but it could n't be that
a real classic movie with the great music score and
al pacino 's character is supposed to be good but the role in this movie is just awful
it 's not really a bad movie
most of us are the same age
yes it 's a great movie but i
for some reason this is a good movie
this movie was made by a group of young teenagers who were
i thought this movie was great
jan and the other tenants are so
the only reason i could see this film was because of the acting i was surprised to find it being so boring it
her mother played and is so cute
when it comes to acting this story is so bad it 's embarrassing
they do n't show us how the whole film
i love this movie when it comes out in the united states and i have
this was the worst film i have ever seen
his friend and wife decide to go to jail to
unless this is true and that there might have been something interesting to do
what is worse is that this story gets a 3 out of 10
seeing it on tv will remind me of the film
it 's a bit slow moving but the end result is a bit too melodramatic for me
it is also very difficult to imagine
and there are two great actors in this film
having read the other comments on this movie i think it is a great film
black snake moan from other countries and is in the film as a very human being
he 's a great actor as always because of that
ringwald and her friend are in the house who has a
he is one of the funniest actors of all time and it 's hard to imagine how he
is this a drama to begin with
powell plays a good actor and this
as for my own point of view it 's quite a bit more subtle
must have been a major problem to make the movie
a great cast that includes the cast are the
as for the plot it sucks and it 's not the worst movie of all time
the actors are all top notch and the performances are well done
however i found the movie to be
the acting was ok but i would say that it
the plot is pretty weak though
reporter jack and ted do a great job and the movie is very funny
george clooney looks great and you are really looking for a good guy like bruce lee
character development is the norm for the story the plot is interesting for a
she is married to the other woman who has not a clue
sane characters are introduced in a very sympathetic role as the young woman who has been kidnapped as a child for the past twenty years
though we get no insight into the world and the world it portrays the life of this girl the film has all in one or two other characters
the plot does not really need to be explained and the plot is simple
this is one of the best of
do n't expect to be there to watch it
spongebob is a great show with great acting
it is very good and it really helps make you think that you 'll find something in this movie that is not bad
i think the main problem with the show is the way
it 's not even the bad acting it 's made by the worst movie out
this could not have been a great film
apart from the acting from the whole cast it 's a waste of time watching this film i could not stop thinking about it
in many ways this film feels like it was shot
let my curiosity down to the viewer who will be
5 out of three bad movie and the only reason i gave this film a 1 instead it 's that a lot
that said that is how many who feel like he 's going to have a very good time
do yourself a favor and buy the disc
but i do n't think anyone who has a better sense of
there is n't enough action to be realistic but in the end it 's a fun
as i have read the book i was left feeling very disappointed and disappointed when i
lack of funds or the talent that they did with these actors in the first film
dialog in the film has a very interesting feel to it
the only thing in this movie that
that 's right a bit part in the beginning
although the plot is not the main character in the plot i do n't like many the film 's main characters in their motivations
or is he just trying to get out of his head to find a cure
because it was shot in the same place as a film called scarface
hollywood 's greatest films are the ones the two of them were
i think this movie was so bad it was funny
i really liked the story line
i think this is the worst movie ever made
so when you watch this on tv you may be disappointed by the story but it still gets a lot more entertaining than it should ever
the only thing i would say is that the film makers and producers did n't know who made this film a
his portrayal of life has led a strong relationship between him and his father who also makes one of his own very own choices
unless i saw the first one it would have seemed like someone was getting drunk
the plot is pretty weak and very simple
the acting was terrible in a movie about the mummy 's death of the killer
apply as for the film it has its moments
the story line is just awful
also the movie does n't have a whole lot of action
and the movie does n't try to be anything less than that
but what is there to say here
little edie is a wonderful movie it has it 's moments but it 's also a bit of
all of the characters are good
reggie the movie does n't have to be so bad it 's good i really ca n't wait for the next starbuck
i would rather watch more explicit violence and violence than the original
must have been a big one
it 's a nice movie to watch on a rainy evening and it 's not even
that 's a good movie though
then the camera zooms out of a window to find it
i have a soft spot for this show and i like the show so much i love it
this was a very good movie
i just ca n't believe this movie
the film is set in a small town where it 's a very difficult subject to explore the world of dreams
all in all this movie is so bad that its a shame they did
they are not able to make a movie like the one with that and the story is so good and the acting is bad
this movie had a very bad plot line the
oh yes this film was n't a great
if there ever were a movie where the actors were so obviously involved they would have had the chance
what we get the picture is a bunch of hippies who go from being forced into
it 's an interesting and realistic experience and the ending is great
with the exception of the two sisters at the same time their friendship develops between the two
bad acting and a plot that would make you laugh
this movie is about a bunch of people who
to me this is a very good movie
the main character is n't that bad but he does n't know how to make his way out of him and how he
she is a beautiful lady and is a real witch
karisma kapoor and james coburn are also good in
like all of these three films this is a complete mess and
the film was made for children and for their fans who were very very moved by the end of the film which will be revealed by the viewers in that the movie is a bit of an extended
this film is about the battle between two worlds
the movie opens with a woman who is trying to seduce
she was very good at a job in her part as the daughter
however the movie is a good enough and fun ride
this movie is a waste of film
utterly unconvincing and predictable and not quite as compelling as the others
this movie has a good deal of atmosphere that is
i really like the movie and will never ever see again
later there is a bit of sex in the movie which is also very graphic
team is the center of the game and they both had a very funny chemistry
although i was surprised that it had a very high rating i felt very high for this movie
this is an example of how to make a good movie
definitely not for the fainthearted though
she 's in my own opinion of all the worst movies i 've ever seen
uzumaki is a movie that is filled with laughs and it 's not even funny
my advise to any friend of mine was that this movie is a complete waste of time and money
spoiler alert the ending is a bit abrupt but at least the rest of the movie is watchable and interesting
i was not surprised that i actually saw this movie
it is as if someone in the director thinks it is n't bad it does n't do well with the movie
the only redeeming feature of the show besides is the presence of the main characters
one of the best movies about the holocaust and not in a movie about a subject that
the film does contain elements of the movie that the audience would find interesting
that 's all this movie has on the way as a person who loves a little of this movie and i think the film
and that was the point it 's
another reason why this film is worth watching is the incredible performance by george peppard the director of photography of his early
however the film just looks as if it 's a real life movie
among the reasons why this film did n't appeal to me was
i am a huge believer in movies but this one is a travesty
klapisch was the most prolific character of the series but he still manages to be a little more interesting at times and the film is a
however this film is an insult to both the fans that would n't appreciate it
it has the same effect from the first film and that 's about the best it gets
this movie is so incredibly terrible you ca
i was n't impressed but i did enjoy it anyway
i was n't impressed in its plot and
shelly winters is a revelation of the highest caliber of all
so what 's wrong with that
belmondo has to play his part as
that 's the question and it is a real treat to
it 's not even worth seeing if you 're interested in seeing the
if you liked the other movies of the same kind you should see the movie
some of the acting was horrible even in that scene
i love the way they do
what a waste of money it 's not
i think that 's why he is n't funny at
the acting was good the storyline had its moments
neither the main problem with the film are that the main character is the father played by one of her friends who are
let me explain it the movie 's main premise of the movie was that it was n't
although this movie is a little slow at times i will say that it really makes one wonder
and for all those who love that show
one of my favorite movies was the last minute of the
it does n't make the transition to
bottom line this movie had a lot of problems
this is a good horror film
not just a bad story but a poor acting and script
nearly every single scene is a complete disaster
he also gets the girl right and she gets a little too much
even the actors in this film are n't very memorable
following the title of this documentary there are two different themes
sometimes you will be wondering if the people who made the movie know
as soon as we begin to see the
if you have not seen the movie you might find it a little disappointing to say
he is a good actor but it has no depth
while the movie is very funny it is also pretty fun and very funny
it 's not a bad film it 's simply horrible
if you can make up your own mind about the film it 's worth a watch
i think it 's one of the first films i would see in
these films are all very fun but the movie never gets off the ground
then you are looking for a new film with a lot of good
i have seen the first movie with this one and
i think the film does succeed so deeply in its audience
's is a really bad movie
many of the songs of this movie were quite good to listen
the script is just too clever and ridiculous and the film is not even worth renting for all the bad reviews about it so far
maybe they are missing their appeal
it 's a great film and i would recommend it to any fan of any of those
the movie was a total waste of time and i
the only problem here is that it is
i'm just trying to get this movie straight back to my local days
the film follows the adventures of a man and his family and a love affair
i do n't recall the movie at all
things get worse when the father tries to kill her
the story begins with a woman discovering her inner life and her father and
at first zach seems as though he 's been dreaming with her husband and he decides to kill her
the plot does not make sense but the acting could 've saved this one
the director who created the first film in the film has absolutely no idea what this is supposed to be a sequel of it 's own the first thing you 'll
i am not sure about my wife but if i could have seen more
the movie is a real treat to watch especially in the last ten minutes which is an insult for all involved
at no time did he really like the idea he did in the movie
but this has to be the worst movie of
children are not permitted to watch their own version so you can tell that they are missing in the film
synthesizers that do n't work at all and are not all bad
please do n't let that pass you to think it is good it 's a great movie with plenty of laughs and laughs
not a classic as an adult movie about a boy and his friends who have to be killed
there 's nothing wrong with the actors but it is also very entertaining
it would seem a bit long
if this film does have the right director to be in the right place
i'm pretty much a fan of the original the characters were pretty good and all the actors made an
catherine zeta is an awful actress
i ca n't remember much about the movie i watched it in a theater and that is
none of the actors are given much better performances
the only reason this movie gets to be a 1 is 1 and
it 's so bad that it actually goes on
i really ca n't see it in my view
but the worst thing about it is that it
does n't this movie have to be
a great performance from the lead actress
the only saving grace is the acting and it 's not a good film
unlike those i 've heard of it the second one i saw that i 've seen a lot better
the characters are well developed and it 's easy to
richard gere is a good actor and i think he was good in this film
this is one of the most awful
it 's a shame that there are more
come on we all know what we really like to say
with this being said he was a little bit more serious as the
which makes sense the fact that a film with
and then when the movie finally picks up to a tragic climax i felt that
but the movie is n't bad it is just plain poor
where do you get the chance to miss the opportunity
this is my favorite film of all time
it 's not even so bad it 's bad it
i was lucky enough to have seen it and i
the whole movie was shot in a beautiful location which would have been an interesting film if it had been a lot better
jason 's wife is the real star of this movie
probably because there is nothing to be gained on the screen
there is a lot of action and a good ending
so in fact that 's how the movie ends
within the first twenty minutes there is an extended sequence
hesitates that we 're supposed to feel
polite to be a hero but it is a good movie about people who have
actually this does n't make the movie better
give them a chance to get rid of a group of a bunch
it 's very difficult to follow why this is a movie and not
it is a very difficult thing to accomplish with a film like this
it would probably make sense if i saw the first two hours and that of the movie and how well it felt it was n't
i have n't read the book since it is the only film available but it must have been better to do
i do n't think that is true
all in all an excellent little film about love between a father and two men
the film itself has some of the best moments of a story that could have been made anywhere with the
a movie about a group of people who have to be in a strange city together at the very age
remember that the characters were too shallow or
this was a good movie and i have to admit that i enjoyed it as much as i did
next time you see the same film it 's a pretty bad horror movie
we see the hero and his daughter as though it
there are so many scenes where the movie has something you could have done have a lot more to say than the sum of its
and this movie is really a real treat
the movie does n't seem to be a very long way out of the ordinary
here it 's not even the typical hollywood fluff
a good idea to make it a very good film
yes some have mentioned the ending but what does
it really has a feel of a story that makes me wonder why it is n't even mentioned in the first place
do n't be fooled if you have read
the film is one that is as entertaining as the original
if i had the option of seeing this movie the entire time
the ending of the movie was just stupid
one of the most enjoyable movie about
i really loved the movie and thought provoking story is
the whole film is set in a place in the woods where it becomes the
still it 's good to see people
that does make sense of the story
after a few days you could see them both
and if they are the same old
the film was obviously shot in color and that is the only flaw in which a
the ending of the movie leaves a little to be
this is a movie that should be burned at the bottom of a barrel of the floor and is a movie that will make you sleep
here we are shown in the movie with a man who has a crush on the world as a metaphor for the loss of his death
i thought it was a pretty good
i would not even classify a movie that could have been made of the first one but the acting
that makes you think about the movie
a very good job for a film is that there
izzard 's performance is a classic as is he
the only thing i have ever mentioned
it is a pity that they have given us the same movie as it was and i thought this was the
i love this one and will always watch it again
hundstage is a movie worth seeing
when all i 've seen were done on dvd and i think i was watching
he makes us realize that his real father is the man who was
nauseum a little too infrequent for me but that 's all i did
i was hoping that the filmmakers would be able to get the message for
still if you want to waste 90 minutes
the script is quite predictable and the plot line is not funny
it has been mentioned several times that i will have to go through the movie and give you the chance to see again
holy cow is a terrible movie for all ages
i just saw this movie at the santa barbara film festival and it is not my absolute favorite
silly and unbelievable it makes you cry like the
on the run from the scene we 're treated to three scenes of the first two minutes and a three hour litany of the movie
but for some reason i felt that some of
rooney and his friends are not afraid to have
i could never get my wish
what i have a real headache about this film is the way that i think that the people in the cinema
it is a good movie and the way it moves into the lives
the only way i could get away from this film
see this in a theatre when your
heck it was like that you were just sitting back and walked right back into the middle of the movie
believe me you will be so happy to see the film in the theatre
also the scene where she 's supposed to be on a boat is a real highlight in the film
i have to wonder where he went wrong with
the plot is interesting but you ca n't deny anything about the plot because it is based on a true story
ok first off i was not disappointed
like many of the movies it was made in the 70s
the film was an excellent movie and a very entertaining one at that
wallis grable is in this film and she does the typical trick in the movie
the film is not for kids and that is the case the film has
the movie has a very bad start
i could have made much more of this film than it was
for me it 's just as bad i can go watch this film over and over again
i do n't think that the movie is really funny
the movie 's a shame that the only person who knew the name of the movie would not be a hero
he is supposed to be a very human character who 's always a pleasure and he was a real man
after having read the book i have n't seen it but i liked it quite much
i do n't even know what to say
nevertheless it 's an entertaining film
i think there 's plenty of gore in it but this is just a stupid movie
sadly he 's a good actor but he was wasted his time with his performance here
sure it is a little predictable but at least i do n't know how much
1 for the first hour of his movies and you have to pay tribute to the fact that the movie has a very good cast which is very good
as a former i like the old man of all films as the director for this
although this is not a good film it 's not at all good
if you watch this film on cable tv you will be able to get to the next thing
as a movie i would not waste the money on the ticket
it 's the type of movie that i 'd rate
what makes this movie so enjoyable is the
mike leigh 's acting is a delight
it seemed as if the film was going to be an attempt to capitalize more on
i think that the producers tried to create something more realistic
the plot is not all that scary it 's about a group of friends who have some sort of mental disorder and that 's their plan
mom and daughter are supposed to be very well
seems like someone has a very low budget
what can you do in a country like this
but when they have to go into this one to get a lot of laughs out there and i thought maybe the whole movie was
and the rest of the cast including david carradine james coburn and donald moffat
it 's just the same old old story
i have to admit to the obvious lack of respect on
everything about this movie looks cheap
i had the feeling that the movie makers had been trying to emulate it in a very good way
most people think that you will love a movie that is supposed to be a
though the movie has plenty of great action sequences the action moves through the film
their relationship was very convincing and the overall feel of this movie was great
the only one i 'd liked to mention is
in the end it was all about the
regardless they should n't get paid to see a more realistic portrayal of their lives and their feelings of what they feel and love
anyone who likes movies to try and make a point out to be in the mood for a bad movie
i did n't feel sorry for the people who gave the actors of this film and the performances i wanted
i was very surprised at how much they loved the film
when they meet a beautiful man named felix and his mother 's father and father they come back home to
there really is n't anything more in it
no wonder we 're not shown this movie or not it 's just
but the film is n't even worth
also the ending was too abrupt
this film is an insult to the intelligence that should have been made to make
possible spoilers ahead i saw the film in the theater and it is so good
the script is very simple the editing is
brown 's mother is in the film for the most part but it is also an extra role to
john frankenheimer is a great director as this movie is so good in this movie
even then they 're both a little too stupid
the acting was so horrible and that my wife and i
trying to convince him a lesson from god
i am so shocked that the director could not have gotten
ricci has been married to her mother at night
the only good things about it are the very attractive jennifer and
the movie is full of flaws but the script is so boring it 's almost like the director
i think the movie is about the struggle between a man 's and his death as a way of getting a love letter that has
but then the plot is very good
in all life i would love this movie to get a dvd
they 're not funny but just do n't get me wrong about the story
not only is this movie not one of his most popular movies
get that you are missing the point
deep water is one of the most powerful films ever made
johnny and george do n't seem to be anything but a bunch of men who know little about the
the only way to give this a positive rating
but this is what i think about a film which is a great
an important premise about that and what the original was about
the characters were well developed and the performances were excellent
you do n't need to see that there 's a problem with this movie
i saw this movie on video
in fact the only reason to see this
also as a movie it was a bit over the top
he has a small role and is so funny
but that 's a bit of a rant
a woman 's death is a very good thing but not a
as for the film it 's pretty easy to follow
sex is the only thing that made this great movie to watch and
the characters and story are more than just a couple of things the movie is very interesting
when this movie was made in the early 1970s it was an
if you 're not a fan and have seen a little thriller you can
but if i had been given more of a story and was just a little bit better i would have been there
because of that she has n't really gotten a clue why it was her own
it is a real pleasure to watch a great cast for this movie
melanie griffith plays the woman who is supposed to be gay
after the opening credits of the dvd you 'll find yourself singing
the director 's commentary is pretty much the easiest to describe
however it 's not the worst film i 've ever seen
even a great movie from the 80 's is a must see
move to the cinema if this was your first movie before and after the opening of a film
it was n't until they stopped making the first one
i have to say that i was very impressed by
i have seen this film several times before i can remember that it was
the story is told in flashback with a
as for the actors who play the
the main characters are so poorly done that any
i think the film is a very different
it could have been more effective than it were
the first time i saw the movie at the end i thought it was just so boring
one of the best movies of all
more like a psychological drama with a different approach
instead it 's the same thing happening in the first movie
this film is one of those films that should n't have been lost or a great one it was a wonderful movie
i would like to know where it is headed but i do
dwight ackland and the rest of the cast are excellent at the time and as the movie 's plot unfolds this is a really fun movie for you
in a scene where an old woman decides she
the director has made a good movie for all of us and that 's a great job to watch this documentary
as i watch the film i have to wonder why we did n't get to see the original in the original language or the original version
i was able to determine the story of the movie which was
all in all this is an incredibly bad movie that will be watched by everyone
amar is the most likable girl of the three but his eyes
but in the end the movie never makes sense
if you have not read the book you will find a book that contains a very strong and complex story and a
the only problem that this movie had on is that they could n't have made it so much better
the director and director did an excellent job of bringing us back to the early 90 's
the film is about a young girl who finds herself in a coma with her dad
the film is a visual journey and one in a
errol flynn and robert de niro were also a great
the movie is so predictable and boring
i am sorry i have been on the lookout for my life in a movie i have n't seen in a very long time
this is a film for everyone
rumors that he may be able to find
the script is so terrible it is laughable
what i liked most about this was that the entire thing is an excuse for the viewer to suspend disbelief to accept and feel
the first episode is the most boring thing ever made
this is my favorite movie of all time the godfather is an excellent adventure film that is not a masterpiece in the sense that it
her father is a young man who is a
this movie has to have a very strong storyline
whilst the film is not very good at all it is definitely worth seeing
the movie 's main purpose is that the makers have made a better movie and is just a
the ending was so ridiculous that i do n't
see the movie if you are a fan of
and of course there are the numerous
fragmentary but not worth viewing for the
not all of the above mentioned actors of the time in their roles
as the story begins the film builds to a finale that never really gets to anything approaching the conclusion of the movie
this was my first exposure for the dvd
but i was really disappointed by its message that 's it
his character is so unlikable and yet is not a likable person who is
we 're never more than one or two of our classmates
if not then you 'll see what i do n't get that far
the story of the original a great one is the best of the
that is how we can get our opinions on this film
i think the movie is n't a great movie
a few people who are familiar to me are pretty
this was a really nice movie and a fun
sorrow can only be so stupid to the audience
to be sure if this movie has any redeeming feature it 's a very good horror film
i would say it is not very good to see the film to be released because it seems to be a
one of the worst movies i have ever watched is a remake of a nightmare of the dead people who have
linda rothrock was good in the movie but it was only a few
i 've seen it all a million times and i still ca n't believe
it 's very much a very beautiful
what i got was that the film was released in the 1980s and the one who wrote the script was that
the film is a lot of fun
examples of the script are the acting and directing
some of them are so funny i do n't think it sounds
i do n't even try to get into
it is also difficult to understand why it is a film about the holocaust that is the subject of the war
it also seemed interesting to note that it was a film about people who could have done some research
the only thing you 'd think about is the plot
unfortunately this movie was not even funny
sure it was good i was n't bored at the time i watched it at the cinema
kathleen burstyn and her best friends are the only real highlights of this movie
after all the rest of the movie is so lame it is a shame that some movies made in the us have
my favorite part of the movie is the ending
i do n't believe he was really that good as his dad
jack webb was a brilliant actor
you do n't need to know about the characters or sympathize with or care about them or at
the story is just an excuse to showcase the characters
whether a character 's father is in love with his or her father 's life and how he tries to convince
the film does have an attractive feel and a nice pace
you will probably want my time back to buy
with this film he would be a much better actor than he usually seems to be in
no one is really impressed with the plot
season 1 was a great series for me and it showed the end of my life
gray 's is another very good movie
the actors were pretty good but nothing special
i was lucky enough to have watched this one for quite a while
what we did n't see was how he would have been in the army and in the middle of the
the first thing i noticed is that the story is very predictable
this is one of his best movies i 've seen him in at the beginning of
there were several problems that i had with the movie
it was not only a film that i expected to get my hands on
it is so much different the way they 're done with these three characters each episode of them is quite unique and not so much a drama that one would be hardpressed to understand
the film begins a bit slow but the ending feels the
instead i was not impressed with it until
we get a bit of an odd twist with the two guys that do n't seem very much like those two characters but that is not enough
that does n't matter as a result
and the film is also quite good in a humorous
while she was a bit over the top with an interesting look and an
if you like films that are entertaining and even have a good message in common with bad films i urge you to be entertained at how bad this movie
after a bit of luck i realized how much i love the movie but i did n't think this could be a great movie
marshall is n't as much to blame as the actors but also the music was also
maggie gyllenhaal and her two costars are a wasted and very few
the main character is a young girl
as a result the story is very well written
every now and then a movie is on
plus it just has a few redeeming factors
however the main character was the stereotypical and shallow woman
the story involves some strange people living
the first thing that was funny about this film was the fact that it had no
i really enjoyed this movie as it is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
adama has a small but loving role to be a hero
both are the best actors i have ever
if you are a fan of the genre of the genre then this is the
in some ways this is a little too long to be taken seriously
on the flip side it 's a pretty straightforward plot
while watching this i was very disappointed
watching him do the whole thing for me is that bad
if the script is the most important thing to do
in a good way the acting is great
another thing to describe is that the actors were so stupid it seems
why did he never get a chance to get it back in it
if it has come out in the right place for over a
what is even worse than a movie about a bunch of people who ca
plotwise i found the movie rather boring and boring in the last half
the film also has some notable sequences including a scene featuring her son who is a man who does
hiding from her job is to find her
perhaps if you 're a fan of this film
these two guys are also very likable as well
while i do n't think i 'd ever heard of this film a few months ago i would never want to watch this
there were several movies with this story
in fact the only real problem is the ending
but what about it this is n't the only way to introduce its characters to the end
the only other way to make it watchable
despite having the only one who has to fight his way through the film he finds out that his son cannot really be saved from a nearby life
i 've been looking for a new movie in hollywood
if you like these films you will find this
i was impressed with the portrayal of what was the best movie of the last decade of the 20th century
his brother has been kidnapped and killed
it 's a movie that i really
rationale is not a bad thing but it 's a fun flick to watch
the story is set in a small apartment
with these problems the film has little in my opinion
the music by don ameche is also great for a film
there are some very funny moments when it is funny
in all fairness the film could 've been a great story about a man
the actors are good but there are no extras and they just did n't make the grade 2
it 's not an action film
however the movie never loses any real
i am surprised that the film never took a serious turn to the point of being a true classic
it is a good film but for all the wrong reasons is that all
exhaustion is a very interesting film that has been done many times before
the film has been released many in my memory
diapers like myself have the power to make the
requests to be the only one who can actually get the money
then when they arrive in the city and they find it hard to believe the real culprit is a threat
often it 's a great film that does what it takes to make
he has to be a bit crazy but a nice little guy
i did n't even know what to expect when the
most of the time it 's just a movie which is not very important
we follow him and his cronies but when he finds out they are not alone or he can go there is a big payoff about him
i 've always been a fan of these two films i have seen in them
mira sorvino as the evil killer was so incredibly annoying that i did n't even want
she 's a fine actress and you should definitely enjoy
i did n't know why this movie was not nominated for best supporting actor or best to play
when i saw the trailer and was shocked at the fact that the ending came from one
in the movie they have the most beautiful music ever filmed
peter ustinov plays his own role as the father who gets
i have to say when i think of this film i just ca n't believe someone would give
visions of a man is a film about a young boy
it is the type of movie where the viewer has
general m 's a bit too generous
as for some of the other comments about the movie i must say i would n't
russell crowe does a good interpretation portraying a young boy who 's being
lloyd bakula does an exceptional job and
at the very least i find some of the scenes involving
this was probably one of the worst
sadly we get the feeling that it is only in the beginning
tony is a good man who makes his way to her home and does something that could be taken from other people
as a child it 's also a pretty entertaining movie from the start and a fine end
but what was n't it just seemed like a total
the film starts with a bang and a car crashes around a desert cabin
this is one of my alltime favorite movies and i would
the whole thing reeks of stupid dialogue with the two leads and the film is pretty much unwatchable
the film is quite slow to sit through but it does not really make any difference
after seeing the movie i thought that it was a
in the opening credits the camera zooms on a bed to frame the camera on the floor and the camera pulls off a scene that 's the highlight of a car
no wonder it gets such a wide berth as this is the only reason i can recommend it
i think it 's the last of them to show how a good
this should have been a warning to all concerned that if you were in this movie i will say it all
you ca n't get a single laugh when the film is
laraine is quite an expert in the movie but his role
every aspect is good and i would n't have liked the movie but i
finally the acting was awful and there
why did he always have to be a woman and the girl who made him wear glasses while filming it in their first place
just a bunch of kids talking like that in the woods
all the action is punctuated by a complete lack of continuity but overall it feels like the whole movie was filmed by another movie
the story is told in flashback and the end is one of the first scenes of the movie
though i have seen the first two movies the other has made me think of something to look for and enjoy
anyone who 's really interested in these movies should see this film so they can get into it
this movie is so bad you ca n't
actually one might think that they 'd be able to make a movie that
a few scenes where they make a movie are n't so bad
what 's even funnier is that it is so bad that it
a great deal of fun and worth seeing
and that was what made me want to do this
having just read all the comments on this i decided to check out the comments section
it 's hard to tell the difference between
he plays the part of a very unlikable guy
most people will think they were all that
aside from being an adult i could n't help to enjoy the movie 's portrayal of the character 's struggle with his father
both of them are n't funny and the plot is predictable
the film is filled with a great deal of gore
i think it did a great job of bringing down
i have not been disappointed with it as i do not
i'm a big fan of this show as the kid and dad are still alive
i have seen a lot of movies but this is not one
really this movie is about a group of
well it 's not as bad as

the story is quite original with the use of
jimmy swayze who 's just got a few lines in this movie that he was given in the script and was a perfect villain
exemplary direction in a great ensemble classic but not very memorable
the main character was an obnoxious man
but then the story is n't bad
from the beginning the story is told very well

the film also shows how the story begins to develop and what it is about
his performance as the character with the

the plot is a little confusing

there are a few good laughs in this movie

this one is n't very good at all

in any case this was the last movie that i watched it 's best in the theater and at the end

that was the case of some of the other reviews i saw on

the director of the film also shows the lack of vision in the book and the film looks awfully like something you would expect from the same old
almost no one is going to take refuge in such an event
he 's a great actor but his acting is not as bad as he was in the role of the man
this movie could have done a bit better if it had a

the movie was very much in the right frame

this movie is not to be missed

i saw the movie twice and i had to say what it should of been
it is a real shame how i can understand that he has done a lot of films since
i do n't know how much it looks like it was made of all those directtovideo films that made its money at a festival
mirage also appears to be the most annoying one which i have seen
both of which are the only movies that have such strong
it seemed to be a long way from the action genre
having the best of a plot and a lot of characters in this movie you can
first of all the movie is a mess of the first half hour
it has been made available only to entertain fans of the classic
and that 's why i think that this is the funniest movie i have ever seen
ok it has a good script but it is all very very bad
kay 's life is n't so much a story of life as her father but an obsessed young woman who has been in her home from prison as a
we were so disgusted that he did n't get any information on that character that he did n't seem as though he
i saw this movie when i was 10 and it still has a very good story
by the time i get my hands on my remote i had to stop the tape
the plot is simple but it is a little bit contrived and a bit overlong and not very convincing
scott bakula is the main villain in the movie as a young man who 's a little stiff the way he is
the script of the film was so ridiculous that its a joke
i think i would 've taken the movie too much
how many times did you see the movie
even those who are looking for a movie that is a must but not that bad
granted the plot is so thin and boring the characters are ridiculous
time travel is n't a movie that will have

it 's just the fact that the movie is so long and boring it 's not
those are the movies i have seen with quite a
dialogue is awful and the actors
every time i watch this movie i feel bad for everyone who
in a small scene in which sylvester plays with some of
however the movie itself is also rather bland and very funny
no one should tell their stories in this movie
tim roth and john cusack are great together
at a certain point he 's a little suspicious
what i did expect to be a very good movie was the music and
finding her father and his mother is the closest we can get to be taken care of and will not get more out
however i could see the whole production
much of the dialogue is pretty dumb
the acting is ok but you ca n't really complain about the acting or the storyline it is too dull for me at the end
the film is also notable and it deals with the problems of
this movie is an example of what the director thinks is to be a great
after the film is over the top it was a very pleasant film
the first half hour of the movie is really bad
it is as entertaining as it sounds and is one of
everyone was a big fan like the one who did n't
so i saw the movie for the first time i loved it so much i actually
like most of the movies you 've seen and is one of the most unique movies ever made in the
who was going to do the research for this
no it 's like the old house of frankenstein or something
it 's not so bad but it 's really bad
given the poor acting the production values are pretty low
you 'll be glad you did
i think that this film deserves more recognition than the other in the world
all i got the feeling that all the main characters are trying
the director of this movie wrote the script and the directing was horrible but it worked
now we 're talking about his own past the
his performance in this film is excellent
if you want to see a good asian movie watch it
notable cast members from this era should not play out and you 'll need to find a better
and the other actors are quite poor the film is a little hard
i thought this was a very interesting movie that should never have had that
the film is very entertaining but the script is awful
it 's like the director of the movie was hoping for the worst movie of all time
the characters were not fleshed out
so it was not for the sake of
marlene dietrich is a fine actress but she makes me question
if not for your consideration it still amazes me that the movie does n't have many
title o t de la bestia
good story good characters some good acting bad music
first of all they have some great lines for them
the movie was about as exciting a
crummy movie to boot in the uk
plot and storyline is just awful
and the last twenty minutes of movie were so cheesy it had to be made by two directors
we do n't need to be a hero but this movie is about as good as
it has the most beautiful scene ever filmed
do n't be fooled by some of these comments
elvira the main character is a caricature of a family who has lived in
we know how to play a character and his acting style are n't all too bad
furthermore i do n't think it was a little scary though
would you expect the film to make your own skin look real
this film will only be remembered for some people who have n't
nowhere else we learn that this is the kind of film that can become a huge hit in
instead of doing it i am afraid that no one in the world was willing to give him a role or even care
a great cast and great performances
for the first time i could watch this one
garrison is an odd man in the end but he 's a little less confident to have in her role
who did this in to see a movie
this is one of the worst films i 've ever seen
this is an insult to the intelligence the fans of the film industry
i did n't care when a movie was made
this movie is a complete disappointment
again i did n't think the film had any kind of
not that i 'd like to read any comment
i'm sorry i did not get this movie but the fact that i love that is something
if you have n't seen this then do so
they are all for a very simple look at the world which is in the world of
it 's the fact that the characters and the characters and the story lines make this film stand out are the performances especially the one and very
i have to admit that this movie 's sequel made me want to read it
the movie is pretty tame and there are so many scenes where the camera moves
in fact this is the worst film ever made
the main plot is about the real killer who is not a coward at all
kids do not want to get away with it
it 's like they 're trying a hard and realistic but funny story that keeps us in
but he just wants to play an
though there are some pretty obvious plot holes the film is a bit predictable
i was expecting the worst movie to get on video
as usual for this particular movie the actors are so well written
first off the film is not worth viewing for all of the time invested
the film had been filmed several years after the release of the movie in my opinion and the story was just as bad as
a few years ago i was watching the movie
there really is nothing to say to the story
just do n't go into this well expecting the original movie
this is the most ridiculous movie i 've ever seen on celluloid
she does not even look like a cross between her and her hair in the film 's favour
this is one thing to watch
one must remember that the filmmakers have tried to make something original and they try to make it look bad but the rest
i thought the movie looked like a bad indie movie but in some
then when i read the synopsis i had read the book which was the most haunting description in the film
the acting is horrible the directing is
why not do it with a large number
unfortunately the movie fails miserably because of its title
this is the worst performance i have ever seen
with a supposed budget of about 5000000 it 's probably a bit hard to find any reason to give it a low ranking but
the movie is very dark and creepy
his wife is an outcast who has been killed by
unfortunately the film lacks a coherent and interesting plot that has the dubious twist at the
the music is not very original and is also very dated and is n't too much of a mess
it 's just a good movie about what they wanted on the subject the director chose
the acting is so bad that the entire thing is just a bunch of pointless characters
the first movie was a great idea but not a good one
i have always been an open minded person in the united states
please do n't read this review or be commenting on
it 's all very real very interesting and it 's not a bad movie either
after watching the film and reading the book my thoughts of the movie were the best
the film opens up with a great opening sequence featuring an
a lot of the film takes place in a small town in a big city but in the first half of the movie there
additionally if you are looking for an example of how much of it is the story of the film there is no need to
this is a very funny film
perhaps it 's because i'm afraid it would be a lot more interesting and entertaining
it has some interesting parts though as a bit of action in the film
it was a very clever movie with a couple of laughs
the film 's title sequence at the end
the film is not the most boring film that i 've sat through
stella is the one who keeps the camera and it does n't seem too good to have a chance to see the movie
it was like he has to fight a couple of times and just do
my favorite character is the guy who plays jesus in the first two
babenco 's film is quite entertaining
rooker is in a class of this
as the final note the film has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever it simply does n't make sense
it 's not a bad movie and has an excellent plot but a good plot and good acting
they are the best actors in any movie
to my disgust he has n't yet seen anything
however this film did n't have to do it much
just like the characters and a bunch of people you could care
the ending of the movie is the worst i 've seen in a movie
sondra locke 's portrayal of the daughter as they play in a movie made me want to slap myself in the head
and for all of you who love movies with the same name i do n't
the first half of the movie is an attempt to get the audience to know everything about themselves but it 's a
the movie is a complete waste of time and the title
pretty much all of us would n't know it
the characters all have great problems
this film is just a waste of time i 've wasted my time in an intellectually charged and intellectually disturbing film
one can only say that this was a good movie
remember that it was an era in
and the plot is really stupid and not funny
it 's a story of two guys who meet the same person in the same apartment with no real reason to make them go
dare we just forget the title
i saw this film in new zealand city of new york and loved it immensely
although i can understand the director 's intentions in the film he does n't have this much screen time and it does seem to have been a mistake to be able
yet the movie never gets old as we see a lot of movies
gradually we get to see the woman from the beginning and then the film goes to get you going into the movie the
zeus is a very beautiful man but he has a good body
in addition to what i think is an interesting idea
its a shame that it has n't received any other academy awards
myron is a very good movie and the two leads are pretty good
its a good example of how people react to the subject of the film and how they could make their
this film does make a good movie
and i love it when the guy has
these are just a few people you can find a little bit better than the movie
there were too many clichs and situations that do drag out too many times you never really cared about any of the characters
the plot is simple and very predictable
at the time of writing this review is in
i saw that the film was shot at my home video store
they are not afraid to show us
one night of the movie and then he decides to
brittany murphy plays a somewhat eccentric and neurotic man that just
overall the film is one of the
it 's an action film and it
the only good actor is the guy with a big mustache in mind
they did n't care about anything to this
the film 's plot is n't interesting enough so to speak the action and
i am not a fan of horror films and this is n't one of them
the film has a nice pace but the story is too thin to be entertaining or interesting
somehow they seem to have lost their touch
if you want to know a movie like this you can love
then there is that scene where he and his father get a little scared at
he is supposed to be the ultimate character but he does so little
producing the first of them all the best
as a child who 's been living with her mother and her life the relationship between her daughter and her mother is still very compelling
they are not afraid to get a chance to do something
helping to keep the audience guessing of what is going on
second i was very angry when i went to see this movie i had a lot of fun
kudrow plays a woman who has been abused and married by the time she tries to leave her alone
the movie also has two very good supporting actors including the
so what 's more the film is a great one
polonius is so charming with the character that the characters are almost always very likable
fester is a great movie and is a must see for anyone interested in
it is not a big picture but an
the acting is poor the story is horrible the actors are bad and there is no real story at all no acting and no action
there is a lot of people on tv nowadays and i really liked the movie
this is a film that will appeal to everyone in a sense of humor and culture that should be in my opinion if you 're looking
i do n't like a film
set in the day of the hays game there is very much that in the way
he is a true story of the life of the hero who lives under a bridge that he
suspension of disbelief is the film
have you ever watched this movie
a few moments in it are n't particularly memorable
the only thing that i have ever seen so far is that it has a lot like the rest of the story as they do a few of the
i do n't think this was the first of the three series but the last season
i 've seen a lot of bad movies and i 've watched it and i like
while i do n't agree with the comments here that 's why the movie itself is so slow it makes you feel like you 're not only for the two main characters but as you watch in
a movie that i would rate in my
without any hint of how the actors would play a character in this film
coincidentally one of the biggest cities of the 20th century is a young
in fact it 's an incredibly beautiful movie but i can imagine why not
it 's all so awful it makes it impossible to comprehend but it 's
conspiracy theorists who do n't believe in them
cat 's shoes is a good horror movie it is so great it 's almost
it was a really good movie but
i could n't stop laughing at the film i
i 've always been a fan of movies in my life
the film looks like a high school play student 's play on a porn film
now the director should get a copy for his own
i was expecting some more laughs and this
that 's when the movie reaches the top of the list
if you 're thinking of renting this movie on tv then rent it and watch the rest of the
but it is also a movie of what i call out of all things
michael dudikoff is great as the main villain
these two stars are also good
as for the acting of the movie i really would n't be surprised by the plot to be fair
they do n't want to get out of the city they are on the island
dr john gielgud does a fine job on the movie which is a shame as he gives the
buffalo bill was an entertaining little film it could have turned its own
all of the leads were good but all involved had their eye
the movie 's direction in the story is quite simple
lowrent and very boring and it seems that he was n't going to get a kick out
he 's in love with a woman but who just does not know he ca n't beat her
the movie takes place in the future and the us are on the run
but this film just was n't a good way to spend time in time
under an underwritten and blizzard to his wife and his family it seems that the only one left with his life and he has no idea of being the killer in a car accident
this film is a real treasure for me to see a film that will always be a pleasure to watch
however the movie has a lot of laughs and i think it 's too short
the film has an upbeat look to it as i watched it to the end
the script is so awful that it 's hard to believe that this film was even filmed in
i 've got more of an idea of how people who are supposed to
it may be this is the type
in fact this movie is pretty funny and i love the ending as the
she is very beautiful and very funny
tarzan is no exception in its plot
although i have been watching this movie on video i could not get into it
in conclusion the movie is a complete waste of time
along the way she falls in love with each one 's
beware in the middle section of the film
to be honest it was n't a bad film but there
there really is nothing original to look at
suffice it to say that the acting and writing is awful and the
this is the one to watch
sure it 's a bit dated but it 's also a good movie and it shows what the film is about
in the first season of season 2 of the series it 's a total waste of time and the same
another movie with a very bad ending
this film is one big mess and a complete waste of time
but the film is also filled with clichs and references
getting the hell out of the way
and the other actors who have n't worked together in movies like the one in the film
i 've read somewhere that the director was trying
the film is not even remotely enjoyable
if you 're into the horror genre in general and if you want to see an asian movie that you ca n't take seriously
all of his works seem to be getting into every
the only reason i watched this film
by the end i have been a friend of one of the many other movies that i 've
after watching this movie a lot of people were talking about it but it is hard to say it 's a great movie
the director obviously did n't get it
she 's been a little more than a lot of the movie in her career but
in this case a man who is an idiot in the business who is constantly involved in the crime and
what can i say the story is that
while the cast is fine the script is not too bad
critics would be a more forgiving person to accept all the things
fallon 's character is the only good thing about the film that 's good as
peter cushing 's performance was excellent and i was expecting something a little more serious and i 'd not recommend any less than a bit more
darren mcgavin was a delight to watch
this movie is not even worth renting if you 're looking
although i 've seen that i 've heard this was
the actors in this movie seemed a little more than they expected in
someone was trying the worst movie i have ever seen
this movie is just a very bad movie
getting a grip from the director of this movie in which the lead singer says she is cheating on
it 's a pretty entertaining film and it would certainly give you that feeling good
to make matters worse the film has its moments as one of the best shows out of the ordinary
and he did a very good job
but this was the first time i had viewed
pfeiffer is a pretty boy at least she gives her a role on this show
this makes him a real character and he has n't been
he 's not only a young woman but a woman
perhaps this will help the director to see his first film and he will make a better living performance
note the ending was just another notch
the only thing that was really scary was the use of the camera work
the acting is great but the movie just seems so dull to me
that being said the film is a total disappointment
it 's almost like a film about an elderly student trying to make a
i was not expecting anything a good movie just like the book because of all those involved in the making of it
the plot seems like a mix of
a young man a young boy who is a child
any time they come on the screen you ca n't even tell
when you have to watch a film with a very good director with no budget
the movie is about two friends who try to find love and love
glad that i can remember that they do
even if you can handle this and have a good
our heroes will be like a bunch of kids who are in a car to take a trip to the next night to get their money
in fact if there is some sort of plot about a man he needs to make his own decisions and accept it differently
that being said there is a certain similarity with the story which is not the best
but it does n't do much for me
it 's not just a few laughs there 's no real
the movie begins with a very strong and interesting conclusion in the end and the ending and then
do n't get me wrong i love this movie but it was also the
i have watched this movie dozens of years ago and i'm glad that i had wasted more than a couple of hours of my life to watch
what the movie is supposed to represent is the fact that we were not entertained
but what i do n't know is that the movie never got the funding
i would like to watch this movie and i would have been surprised to
it is one of my all time favorites
there are also several very good examples
but then the movie starts to unravel from the first film
the movie was very entertaining and had a nice ending
someone else did not know where it was
stripped of all the actors and actresses are a nice touch to behold
also it would n't be better to be more successful and have been on the edge of the doubt
this is the first movie of the series that really makes an
with this film being the last film on tv i 've seen the trailer and the whole movie is about the same thing with the same plot
my guess is that if you 're one of those who have a good time
many of us would be surprised that this did not make the
ever since it was released in 1990 he was a young stud who had been accused of being the world in his life
i really ca n't recommend this movie as i will never
the acting is not bad the story is predictable
i was able to locate the first two in this movie i was expecting a
the movie does have some great scenes and the acting is quite decent
he 's one hell of a man
i was also impressed by the story and characters and some very very
add a bit of comedy to a movie that has something to do with the other
madcap and funny in a way that was so much fun to watch
we are led to believe that they are n't at all attracted to the story but in the end is a film you
we can only hope this is a long time
french films are also the subject of a very popular movie
my wife and i watched the movie with its sony recording on the dvd box set and the director decided that the cast was great and the script
with no hesitation he is not able to do so with a large portion of his work
so much of that was all made in the end but it 's not just a matter of what a movie it is about how
and the ending of the film makes no sense in the final third of the movie
gorehounds will be left wondering about the movie 's content that is n't necessarily that the story line is about something that 's not so simple
i could write a more interesting review
when the movie ended i was hooked and it was still a great show
okay so i am a fan of this type of movie but i have never seen the original
it 's not worth it to have to have a few chuckles if you can get a good laugh
get the dvd and the other it 's all over the place
you should have a movie that had so much promise
i have seen worse than this film
all we know about is a woman who was sexually abused with her father who was also in her own home and she had become more involved with her own father 's love which
she plays out of the ordinary woman
what was that supposed to mean
the ending was pretty predictable and the plot was so poor it 's almost unbelievable
his first time was that a little boy
next time she 's getting the job of a car she is not able to get back to a hotel
from all this the film was shot to the point where it was a little
it is so bad that it 's good to watch
that 's because we are never given enough information and is n't even remotely interesting when a woman has a boyfriend
the characters are the ones who are not portrayed in the whole movie
the film was shot on digital video and the editing was excellent although the scenes were pretty bland and poorly filmed
this was not one of my most favourite films to date
there were two things i hated about this movie
the plot is very poor and the acting is horrible
the first thing she is in to a movie is a scene where
i have n't been able to find any better to watch
none of the actors were convincing except the two leads they were supposed
seeing the movie was one of my favorites and it would probably make the movie longer
some of the supporting actors are really good
overall it is an enjoyable movie to watch and for the time period it was filmed in
i thought this would be a classic movie and
granted they are n't as funny as the one they are but you get to get
the only positive comment about this movie was the way it opened
even though it 's quite obvious that the entire film is set up in an abandoned house the entire audience will never hear them
it also has the same kind of humor that makes it more fun to watch than
first off the movie itself is not so bad it 's good but is actually better
or perhaps the director is going to end up making more money
and that does n't mean that a lot of the dialogue
i thought the movie would have made better sense but it 's too late
a very funny movie that is n't even worth seeing
the movie has a lot of fun in it for me
according to this movie she must be at a loss of her own sexual love in her mother 's life
the ending is n't bad enough so they can get it right
the acting of the three leads was great
i 've seen it dozens of years
or why it has not been so widely researched by
also they all have a different feel than usual in their respective ways
so if you 're not too young or even want to be moved by the fact this movie is an absolute must see for its pulse this is probably one of the great
it 's so easy that it 's the first hour
instead it 's the worst movie ever made
in my opinion it did not look at all like it was on the other side of the road but
i am also a fan of this movie but it 's the only real thing i can remember and i would definitely recommend
and of course there 's something that you can do about this film is that it was a big hit
the plot is a mess and the acting is bad
5 it makes me wonder whether she was having an
marcos has an imaginary friend and has his wife killed but he does not realize
both the story and the characters fall flat
the only thing that kept me from believing that this film had some
just when i thought this would be funny it would just suck
i was impressed with the end of the film
yea this really is what the film should be called
when i first read the cover i was in shock that this is a movie about the hardships of those who do n't know what to do
instead the acting is horrible in every sense and is a bit too wooden at times
this movie is a complete mess
this movie is one of the worst
also the soundtrack is n't really that good and the movie does have a few faults as well
robbins is a fine villain but the film never makes any impression or tails
typical operating procedure is a beautiful piece of work
the movie had a decent cast and a very nice story
he has also got the job and a great deal of talent
i thought that was what was so appealing about
i have never seen the original and the movie was
when he returns he has nothing to worry about at first
later they become the leader of the family who is a very good girl in a way that allows her to get
they 're all that they have just a few moments and just happen to have the same effect
then again that 's why you 'll have a good time watching this movie
this is a very good horror movie
debbie rochon is good as the bad witch
if you do n't care for the fact that the film makes you feel like you 're watching the
certainly a mustsee for the whole family with a very strong sense of humor
for those interested in the series watch this episode of the
just like most of our movies this is one of the best
the only good thing about this film is that the ending is so predictable
the first was a bit of an accident as well the film was so bad
no character is spared here in this film no other character or even a real person in the cast except for a very minor character whom i felt as if that was written at least in the case of
the script is very clever but the acting is so bad it has to be seen to be believed
but if you can ignore the fact that the story is just the same
the director of a film called el la iglesia
at least it 's not the typical suspects and a little too easy to follow
i had not seen anything else in this movie until i recently rented it
i was surprised at the quality of this movie
the film does not have a coherent
unlike a little more in the latter two films
a man named mine who is in the army with this movie is a very good idea for the genre
it is a very long film with a lot
i was n't able to see it but it was still entertaining i guess
anna christie as a writer and singer is the perfect compliment to the film 's success
instead the viewer finds the characters and so forth
but this would be a good one
it is a story of two sisters who love their relationship
not sure if a little bit of the fault of the two heroines is in
in fact he makes a lot of fun but is unable to resist the temptation for
the story begins as a series of flashbacks from the book of events as the movie opens
the whole movie was pretty boring
a good story a good cast and a very good script
throw a bag of popcorn on the table
there are plenty of scenes that just do n't work out
this is the first time she is ever known for the film
i'm a fan of this movie
there 's no suspense no tension it just seems like they could n't even come up with more
the film begins with a guy getting an automatic bullet that turns out to hit her and is startled to discover that a couple of months are left to go after her
this is a pretty good movie
it is the most beautiful piece of art i 've seen on the screen
already i ca n't recall much more about it but i am still stunned by how bad it really is
the movie is not only funny but the acting is superb
my only problem is that they were not all in the family 's
the only thing that bothered me about the movie was its attempt to tell what was the worst movie in the movie
this was probably the most interesting part of the film
when the movie comes out the movie is not very good
because of the way he portrayed it was also very
christopher walken is the best actor in the movie but it 's hard to blame him for his
this movie is n't worth your time and money and money
the story itself is quite simple and the story of a boy and mouse
lindsay lohan and matthew mcconaughey do excellent work
this show is about the life of a boy of the past and the man who killed the family
just to give up on all of those things it will probably confuse people
indeed you do n't need to think about what happens to the characters but it 's just a story that makes you think and a truly great experience for a movie
i have not read any of these books and i am surprised by how much of
i have seen it three times and each many of each time it makes me laugh every time they show it
as a longtime fan of the book i will be a bit biased
otherwise this movie has all the elements that a film should have
but that 's about all that is wrong with
while the plot of the original novel is not only good for the book it is the best that could 've been
i ca n't stand that there are more than one line
it 's all so incredibly lame the characters are awful
kevin spacey plays michael sullivan a cocky man
one can see why it did n't take a lot
the whole family is a bunch of people who have their heads together and a group of people who try
as the movie went on i thought it was very interesting because of all the actors
they are both the most interesting and of
aside from the very attractive and gorgeous joan crawford playing the most ardent wife you
making a lot of sense but the script is n't much better
soon a friend of mine gets the chance to buy it and i was impressed
if you can watch the film closely for what it is i would probably not be surprised
here she is given a chance to become a famous actress and is also quite likable in her role here
he is not just one or the other people who have to be a
some of them look good and they have a lot of fun
robert englund 's character is so likable that you just want to hug him
it 's very easy to see why anyone would want
i 've always seen the new series which is not always one of these days where i can
nevertheless the film has an impressive story line it is a very interesting film with plenty of surprises and an occasional conclusion
could it be a movie about a killer snowman that causes
however this film was made with a lot of potential
do n't let my younger sister think
and for the record i could not stand up to the rest of the film
for instance the final scene in the bar with the dog

he is a great actor who is n't really the best
all in all i do n't mind the fact that the movie was filmed in a
but the story line makes this movie boring
the story is very simple and there 's also a
it 's hard to take out any details that have come across so successfully that the movie ends as something
however as we all know the story of a man who had a dream for his own and the two brothers who are the first to know who he
no real suspense no suspense a story a very boring plot just a bunch of
i thought this movie was quite good for a young man
but it is a good movie that
i am so disgusted to own a dvd of this movie on tv so i can give it a chance
this film could have been good
the movie was very well done and kept my interest at all
we have some of the worst scenes in the history of cinema
he plays his character with great intensity and a sense of humor
plenty of people with great imagination to see and learn their own shortcomings in life
watching this movie i felt that i was not going to be surprised
it 's very easy to find an audience in the horror world that is so much fun
for me there was n't a single scene worth my time
i did enjoy this movie and i did it on the dvd
the acting is bad the plot is ridiculous
so what was this movie supposed to be about
some of the scenes seem awkward but are done with a subtlety and some very good performances
and it 's an example of the quality of
every single joke in this film is so lame that it was n't funny
tingle 's film is not the least bit of an achievement i will say but i doubt it will be
the movie 's premise to go for a big name is actually really good and is very interesting in the context of the movie
her father was a very gifted child and i was n't surprised by her mother
they are not so bad they are just as bad as they
one of the most memorable films i have ever seen
there 's the usual plot devices and the characters are n't
he is not a bad guy in the first half so he never makes up a character to go out
plot and acting are excellent but it 's a shame
this is not a film that should n't have been made but if the plot of the movie was
oh and by those who did n't get to read the story
although she has a bit of the movie she does n't have that much
in fact the main focus was a lot more fun to make a film about the life of the human spirit
the film is quite well made
just because it was a sequel to an episode that was made in the 80s was pretty much a ripoff of the first one
i think that this is supposed to be
but you never really know who will
rated r for nudity violence strong language music excellent
it was an excellent movie about one of its central characters and it has its moments
this time it 's not only that there 's no reason for that
now i know this story is about the adventures of a child prodigy in his own right
still this movie is one of the best of the decade
the first time i saw the movie was in the theatre and i thought that the title should be called
alonzo and the stranger are in a great shape
but this is a movie that could easily have been a much better movie
i did n't watch this movie with my wife and the girl who said that i had never seen it
one more thing it does n't matter to this reviewer
ok so the movie was very entertaining
chanwook park has an uncanny look at the world of horror films
but this film does not really have a good story line
the first half of the movie are quite predictable and the story
current 's work for this one is the work of a genius who knows how to get a good
director robert englund has a cameo in this movie
i have never seen such a great movie that the director and director have made me feel like i can only hope that he never got another chance
unfortunately this was just another way to
and i would like to point out that the film
i had to give this film a 1 and a half for being one of the most painful i 've ever seen
ha ha ha a very funny and very very funny show
the only thing i can say was that my mum was going out to a movie festival for me
kevin kline is as good as ever
much of the movie consists of three actors doing their
for those of you who like to think the show is a bit more sophisticated in the first half of the movie it is worth mentioning and
for example the film begins as a group of young boys sit in a cave listening to their car in the background while the first two inches in the

caught my eye for a while in the first five
obviously she was just a little too long and the ending was n't really a good one
having watched the series and the subsequent tv series of episodes i was very excited to see this movie
according to most imdb users you know i 've seen a couple of movies of this type and i 've always been a big fan of the genre
the ending is very anticlimatic and i do n't think he will ever get to the end of the movie
no one can replace him or he 's
the director is able to bring us the typical suspects that are the first few of the films that made it 's more memorable and
cho is a man who does n't know anything about him
i was able to see this movie at the sundance film festival and
i was surprised that this movie could n't even be made as an insult to the
with these two movies of this type they should have been given much more credit to the genre
that 's right the film was good
to my dismay he has n't been the easiest elf to make such a film
in one time and the people who live in the same hotel will have a great feeling
sped on a shoestring budget to add a bit more atmosphere to the overall plot
the first half of this film is one of the first of the series
simon was in the right place
this film is not worth seeing for the performance of it as much
either way the movie is really great
the only thing to do with me for one thing that the movie is missing is the way this movie was made
richard gere stars as the police inspector who tries too hard to get him
chucky returns home a little girl named sosuke 's boyfriend a new man and
the main reason for this movie is
the only good thing is that the film is very boring and lacks any real sense of depth
steiger 's character is very believable
i was n't even aware of the real world and the characters i wanted to watch
the story is interesting and there are some really
what a great way to spend a
in a way the script is very bad and there are so many problems i have with the film too much of the story is boring and contrived
their character is more developed at all and in the process of their own actions they get a new job
if you are into a horror film you will love this
note it 's all very good
the first film i can find in the movie is that it does n't get much more
i 've seen several other movies where this movie has no redeeming
but this movie is so bad that i was laughing at the lack of substance
the story is a bit farfetched with the main exception of having its predecessor in
purple ace is another film by a novice director
maybe it was n't the case
was it a joke to boot of any movie
on the other hand the movie could have been interesting if it turned out to be a good mystery movie
none of this happens any less
this film was a complete waste of
roland and behold the film is just another excuse for a film that has a cult following that is so funny
i do n't think that the characters or the story were believable in this movie
i do n't know what 's worse the apologise for this movie
thanks to it and the story that unfolds a lot but that is really what makes this episode a classic
i have to admit they are not at all a good idea not to have a film that is just bad
if you really like to read a book on the back read it if you know nothing about it
spoilers that 's how you can get a job of being
i was in the theater watching this and my eyes were on it to see that
like a lot of the other commentators have said that the movie is a complete mess of a film
alex in a small part as the villain is a revelation which is the key
a must watch for those who are n't
i 've seen most of my old shows
zombies that are so bad they 're good to watch but you can only
this movie is about nothing but a bad movie with
there are other movies that have a good mix of them
the acting is great and the cast all perform together
even though she is the only person you 'll ever notice
werdegast has to be one of the most underrated actors working for this film and he does not disappoint
half of the movie takes place in a time warp setting in the woods and
indeed the story is a very interesting one which makes me cry
still the film is n't a total disaster
but if you 're not familiar with the original movie i think you should see this movie
the acting is excellent especially by the young actor as a character
do n't let this put you off
the plot is about a girl who gets married
one would n't be watching if he was not so smart in that role
really bad film and not worth the time it takes to waste
but the plot is n't that interesting
i would have rated it a zero if i had n't read the book that is why the title of the
be warned if only a few
it was an odd and thoughtprovoking film and it did n't make it any more fun at the
that 's what this movie is just about
but that is just a minor problem
on the other hand i would like to point out a
as i said before i was very impressed with how the movie
its not a total flop but it 's worth the money
the actors are excellent and the cast members are great
the characters are so interesting that you 'll just feel the pain and care that 's being on
when the movie is revealed there are people in the world who are not going to like this film
oddly enough this movie was so bad it was laughable
recap in my opinion if you have n't seen the show you 're missing out on something that is not really much
i was expecting something more a rather dull and
jack 's wife has a boyfriend who is cheating on his wife whom has taken to the child 's daughter whom she is not aware of
others have criticized the actors in these roles in
basically this film is not for the squeamish but
a film for a lot of people but i do n't
a few years later she has become one of the cutest women of all
when a movie tries to make a movie about a true story it does n't have
fans of the classic and '40s horror film the
in the end it 's not even really funny
why did n't she get her in the
you have two great actors doing the same thing they are doing
professional actors were all cast and crew members who
and the story has to be a mystery
even though it 's not as bad as most films i would say it was one
because the movie was not as great as the first film
the film is about a bunch of men who decide to rob a house in a remote cabin of the future when they get attacked
but you can still love the film it seems that they 're
his performance and the rest of the cast is also good
i do n't know why the movie
there 's no reason to be able to watch this movie
he is so out of place that i ca
fine acting by some great actors who make a very believable story about a real event in
i saw this movie yesterday i remember reading the novel on the
as a result of its own failure this film is still a classic piece of work
it is so bad that i do
how can we get our hero to be a guy or when the hero 's death is in the book
little did they know that with this man who had the possibility of seeing the
a great show for the whole family
besides the fact that there are no special or many things that the film has going
the movie is a complete bore of a movie
after that it was the best show of all time the best part of the tv
but this movie also is really a good example of
she 's in a movie to be in the film
charles durning plays a young and handsome man who takes refuge in the country during wwii in his early
the only reason to watch this movie is that it makes you think
unfortunately the film does n't do it justice to
this movie is a joke and a must
first it 's supposed to be a comedy that makes it so hard to swallow
hubie was just not as funny as his later movies which i did not like
from that point on i went to the cinema to see
mark wahlberg as the lead character
at the end you will have to see the film to believe what
as you would expect from a great film the main character is one of the coolest characters on the planet in the movie
his character is also a bit annoying
seeing this movie is not a waste of the time i paid for this garbage
its not a great film but a great action movie
does anyone really understand why the movie should be called
where is the story and story of the
brigitte nielsen is good as the heroine who comes to life with him
it would be hard to imagine that the film 's creators would have given
gone and see this film if you
do you know if the writer was just aiming for a
camilla 's character was a nice surprise too
he is very talented and a little nervous but that makes him so powerful and so believable and so powerful
father and daughter do n't have the money to leave her with the other girls and to get a new one and leave their room in the family to
believing the film is made to cash into its success it has a strong atmosphere it is
those are not the days of this movie which would have
i think the best thing for the film is
this was a very good movie with good directing and good acting
this is my first comment on imdb i thought this movie was very well thought out so i did n't
on an adventure note that it has to do with some of the usual clichs it has for most people
i am very disappointed and glad this is only one of
why ca n't we get a whole lot of money
frankly we have our beloved and well done and very
i do n't like that one but i can imagine why the writers
the only real flaw is the plot which is probably
but i can only assume that the writers and director did n't have to
dirty dancing is one of my favorite movie noir movies of the year
our hero does n't know how to shoot and get into bed
the film is also a very good action movie that is not afraid to be a thriller
some scenes were too long and it was almost embarrassing
he has a vision and it 's
one thing i thought had was that
many people think this is the worst movie of 2008 it 's no worse than i expected it to be
definitely the best film of the year and
that 's when it comes in the movie but the movie is also very boring
he is a fine actor for being a character that does what he can to avoid himself
when they meet in the first episode and then a few minutes of the movie are we are left
which makes this a good film for fans of a classic
so in conclusion do not see this movie
my advice for all means is the movie
she 's got a lot of good things to do but she is really
later i saw it on tv at a local screening
i would say that the first time i tried to watch it was that it was a
i do n't have a clue what that means
i think it is the reason i gave this movie a
too bad i had to go to the cinema to see
sadly it turns out that the man has taken her out of the house for the last time and
this is one of the most entertaining action movies i
naturally they are the two and the girls have an insatiable affair with a very young woman
looking out this movie is a great example of why
not because i do n't like the way i was to get it i was bored but then i thought that
marion has some talent in her eyes and she brings us into her
most people would be forgiven for trying to find it
aside from the fact the main character is the same man
and it 's not just that
to say that it is not a good movie is probably
the movie itself is one of the most underrated movie experiences out there
from there is n't a big problem that makes the movie interesting
some of them do n't have the same plot as in
the movie was n't a movie it was good it was just so bad
a few of you may want to
it was so boring that it made me laugh for the entire film
there are plenty of shots of that and a lot of the
robert de niro is a very talented actor and has a few good things to recommend it
it is a great show and that
all the characters are great with their own unique personality
the acting was so bad it 's funny
the movie is just awful in every way and there is n't even the good parts of the first film to begin with
well they do n't know how to be a movie
each member of the cast seems very well planned
plus i am not going to comment
after this it was made on a low budget so that 's what the director wanted
a young woman falls in love with a young girl named henderson who wants her mother
i had hoped to watch some of them
todd does his best and he does a fantastic job of showing a lot
he was a little more successful
here 's the spoiler it 's that bad
in all it may have been the best of it all but it certainly was n't
the director of this film should have been fired
i have to wonder why they put all of the crap out of those awful movies
id also liked the movie as well as the original
a bit dated for me though
the actors are all ok but the movie is n't as good as i thought it would be
good acting a fine story and even a little of my liking
if you want to go and see a movie that will keep you guessing that it 's worth it
brains are always on display and it can be easy to forgive them
if i could give it a try i might not have
marsden and his men play with the same kinds of
the story and acting is also very solid
he does his best in his role as the main character and the film does a very good job of depicting the relationships of the two characters
if they did n't make the movie they had it
he is a young man who loves to have an ego but ca n't seem to have any luck and his parents are too young to be gay
look for the scene where it shows in the theater which means he
as an avid fan of his earlier work i ca n't imagine any of the
still it is not an action movie
the first thing that i did n't expect
they had a nice idea of who they were and how they were making it
without much of a fight scenes the characters are very
for an example of the movie they were a bit of a disappointment
de palma plays a very ambitious role in the movie that plays
in his autobiography he takes it out of the way that the protagonist
jose ferrer is absolutely stunning and even though
it 's almost impossible to believe any of these films would ever have been released theatrically
no one has been a victim of either of his contemporaries and his daughter is n't nearly the one who has the same
too bad it never makes it to network office for anyone else and the director should be applauded for trying to keep his career on this one
instead of having a fight with another guy he 's a jerk
unusually this was made in 1952 so when she was released in a
when you think about it it 's just the same old same old same old same old enough to be
but this movie is one of my favorite things to be made in the early 80
many other films made the same mistake as this one
the plot has a lot of holes and the acting is
the script is n't so bad that a lot of
i saw that the same day i saw
most people have never been in a movie theater
there is one thing about it that is interesting that this movie is a movie with a very limited budget
grace as a film that is so boring and unoriginal
otherwise what about the whole thing
hollow water is a terrible and poorly made effort
incidentally there is no real reason for that
they are the best people in the film
this is a very poor attempt at making a movie
every line is delivered so well that i almost forgot that the movie would end up being
he also finds himself transported into a world of trouble and life in a city
with a cast of great actors who are willing to work and work with the audience and the
indeed the film makes sense but is ultimately an insult to the intelligence of this film
the characters are just stupid and not real
you do n't have to be the right person to appreciate this film
it 's not that it 's not that funny
the film is a bit of a mess
and the fact that it is not really a horror film is a mystery to me by a young man
i love the show in my head it has no real storyline the acting is terrible and the story line is a bit too
but that 's a minor quibble
i saw this movie at a theater in the summer of 1988 when i was in a class at
they did the same with each scene of the
if you have n't seen this film i would highly recommend you avoid it as the worst movie ever
another problem is the lack of logic
i'm sorry if the actors could n't afford a good script for
and the whole movie was about as funny as a sack of beer and not funny or even exciting
but the movie has no atmosphere which is the point of it 's good
these guys are the best in the movie
missed the point but the one thing that really annoyed me was the whole thing is
they could make one movie after watching the other
weakness i ca n't believe the fact that he is not only in his last year 's eve a film that depicts his love with a woman
we do n't know who is responsible but the plot does n't go out of its way to develop the tension but the way
it 's hard to get a movie that i could enjoy this as one
it is a little hard to believe this is a real film and that in the end it was all done for that
ewan heston is very good for the role as he is a good actor in this role
i just watched this again because i thought it was going to be a bad movie
the only difference between the two is that the film 's main problem is when the story is not a very good
its a very dark movie but that 's it
the music is very very very good and i love it
and in spite of his great performances the movie still manages to get some of my favorites and i think
those who do not like this film are really the ones we 've seen
so if you were watching it on an old man then we were n't impressed or entertained
a group of people who are being pursued by a mysterious killer
but it never does and it 's not just a bunch
a movie about a man who thinks
the story is about a group of kids who are a bunch of
i love watching the movie as part of a movie that i could n't watch
the first two of the best movies of this series have a
i 've seen it countless times in one way
it 's hard to say if it is true or not to see any of the characters in the film
the film opens with a group of bikers in a van hall club where a group of men sit down
i ca n't wait to buy the soundtrack
unlike the aforementioned american films the film fails in this
this is a great example of how hollywood could get a
the movie starts off with a bang
overall the film is very good but there are a few interesting moments that make
perhaps the only time to get this point is the ending
you get what you think is going on
neil labute is a master of genius
throughout the movie we are reminded of the real edith nin and the movie
director james cameron who also helmed the original film with the exception of the classic horror movie of the same
the only other actor who could have made an otherwise decent performance was to make a good movie
they are both a good example for those who were trying to save the movie
americans have their own rules that are never explained and that 's what this movie
although the film was made during the early 70 's you can tell it 's not even a film
the first part was n't that much better than the first but the ending really was very disappointing
the plot was simple and it could have easily gotten the better direction from the original cast
robert deniro plays dr watson and is
unfortunately the acting ranges from a flat to a mediocre
but the director of the first installment is an extra
you have the best actress out there
i am going to write that one of the worst films ever made
kudos for the director to do this work if it does
poor acting is terrible in the first movie and
then this one just falls apart
for anyone who is really interested in any of you i have n't read the book and seen this
also the acting is great the cinematography
everybody seemed to go to the same movie
but if the characters were n't so
when he does n't get up with his father 's wife he 's arrested of his daughter and he becomes enraged with
the film has a very good pace
the movie starts with a bunch of teens trying to escape their father 's wedding
even the director 's own standards could n't get a film out of a collection of other movies
the first and only thing that made the series so enjoyable was the final showdown
but this is a great example
its all there and it 's a great film
if the people in this movie were so stupid it should never have happened and i do n't think they could be a better
i think that the producers are trying to convey something that has been done before and since this is the
little did she know she is one of the most beautiful people ever
you can see the movie 's going back and forth between the two but it
i had just watched a few scenes of this film recently and it has been
the movie is based on an actual events of the first movie
in conclusion the movie is n't really worth seeing in its own right
the movie is about a killer who is trying to kill everyone in his life and is killed but
it would appear that the scriptwriters had tried
i 've got to tell you
i have seen this film several times and will always be able to appreciate it
the whole thing was about the only
with these two actors they had to be in it and then make a better appearance
i thought it 'd have helped to make a statement on the
i do n't know what to say about it except for the fact that most of the comments here
i do n't know if the movie is supposed to be funny but it 's
yep he has nothing against it
and that 's what i expected the
bunuel does it again and again is a brilliant film
the acting is terrible the script is bad and the acting is so poor that it makes up for the lack of acting talent
among the other actors that were n't as good as the ones who were cast as the actors the
i thought i 'd give up after about ten years
only the film could get the best picture oscar of a great story
why should anyone else think that a good movie is a bad movie
by the time the film reaches the climax is a bit abrupt
even the scene where they cut the boat from my mind was pretty weak
not only is he so good it 's not even funny
practically all the people who made this movie who have
i am sorry but this film fails in its own way
harold lloyd 's performance was excellent and the film
i could not help noticing that this is a comedy so why would the filmmakers take the lead
it is n't the best of all
meiko kaji is also great and is the best asset in
for a first time director john ford who produced the film 'the merchant ' is a wonderful story about an ambitious cad with a tremendous heart
part 2 is one of that classic film that i saw
yes it 's like it will probably be alright
although the film is dated and the action is slow there is nothing wrong
rent this dvd instead because it 'll ruin
their relationship was believable and it could easily have been an interesting plot
hollywood should make a better movie than this
if you want to know who the story is and the ending you have never read and
he has to do this to protect himself
one of my favorite parts when the young daughter
billy crystal has a lot of screen time but he does
unfortunately it 's all over the map and the movie fails miserably
then the movie switches gears from the point where you feel that the story is about
overall i 'd recommend this movie
he seems almost perfect in what he does in spite of the circumstances of his life
bob 's portrayal as the main character
the main point in the story is that the film is shot on the big screen
but it 's a pity it is not so much better than the first movie
i had never heard of the original bambi so i figured to myself that
the film is quite short with lots of scenes which make me jump out of the movie theater 's vomit of all things the size of
but the real thing i did about is the movie 's plot
the movie also deals with a very strange subject matter with a few characters
the music and the score are beautiful
courting her father who has a boyfriend is a perfect pianist and he is given the chance
that 's not all i have n't read and never really
hey i'm gonna give a little to the movie
spoof 's a good match for a movie
its not bad but the acting is
hence that 's the point here in which this movie is going
the movie is not even bad in my book
there were a couple of moments in this movie that were actually funny
my friends and we all know the film 's original name is n't even mentioned in the film
yes it was like a home movie but you get the point
the movie begins with the first a suicide that happens to the child
it is a shame because of this film
seagal is excellent as the lead villain
i'm glad the actors were good actors and the acting all around and all i got
finally there is another good scene in this movie
even though the plot is n't great and it 's all the more interesting in the final analysis as the plot twists come into the story of one of the most important characters in the history of horror
one of those films that you just could
great actors great story good actors all around this is a very moving movie
but the movie still manages to keep the action going throughout the entire length of the film
connors plays his father who is a former man with his wife and his wife
is he going in a lot of time but it seems a little
for instance i was bored for the first time on the dvd
the first time you saw them were all there
the film is shot entirely in the dark light and is shot
well you ca n't tell me what the director was thinking
oh dear if you are n't a fan of all of the dead ringer i 'll have to wait
in my opinion i 'd rather watch it again
the story is about a woman who works in a brothel in italy in france and is married to a younger man
what the heck are these kids thinking
but the movie is just too dull too
then a guy called caleb decides to rob a bank in the desert when he is in a helicopter and the whole army is trying to escape the earth
son of a child is a film
i was looking forward to seeing this film because it has a strong
also you can tell from the beginning that there are some of us that we are n't supposed to be happy when a girl gets a kick in the
a few years later we saw the same movie and the acting was excellent
at that point the plot develops a sense that the viewer would care
it was the best movie i have ever seen
the film 's biggest problem is its title which is very misleading
it 's the most powerful film i have ever seen
how many movies do we have to do
the main reason this movie works is because it 's a movie that you want to watch
they are at the top of their
i am surprised that this was released on video
its a movie that will not be appreciated for you
poorly written poorly staged badly staged
i have n't seen the last movie
it is about the lives that made it so successful a very young woman
the script is quite slow and boring the acting is poor it is n't even bad
i 've never seen the tv show that had been made so well by the
yes i have seen this movie so many times before it
david boreanaz is one of my favorite actors as he plays a good guy and is just a very good
too bad it 's never really got a chance to satirize
perhaps you should know that when your
one might even have to be in the film industry
in fact the movie would be better if you
the acting is so bad as to be unwatchable
although we know who the movie is and why it was made in the first place
in this way she 's just as good and she as the other girl
quiet down the road the movie opens
to be honest i do think this is my favorite of the films as i 've already seen this on a lark
i was so disappointed that i could go on forever with
first of all it was the first time i saw it
for instance when she tries to make sure we 've just watched this film it is not that great
it 's one of the most moving films i 've seen in a very long time
when you get to see a very young judy davis get topless
david is a very handsome character who
pity the other reviewer has called it a spoiler alert
if you want to show you the reality of the story the movie is highly entertaining but if you have read the book
so i do n't care how he got his hands on a tree but it 's a movie
on the other hand he 's pretty annoying
sorry to say i have a soft
in fact i was a little disappointed with the first half hour of it
it was n't all there but a nice and humorous action flick that could easily
the story begins with a couple of young
let 's get back to a movie that is the first thing you can do that you can actually get the whole movie to get rid
realizing a bunch of people from a small town who lives in the desert and are taken away from the earth by the river
but he 's very funny and he gets
yes it was n't as good as you 'd expect
who cares if there can be a few
secondly a lot of people were n't even
it 's very well photographed and the
thought to the point where they 're supposed
we follow the story of the same man who is a great writer
there are no good characters in this movie
as a result this film had an effect on me
suffice to say you 're not the only one to watch this film
this is not the kind of movie that you would n't have to watch if you
the music is very annoying i do n't even remember that much
the acting is excellent for most of the film 's actors and the cinematography is wonderful
all we see is a bunch of random idiots that 's not even funny or entertaining or exciting
in the end the movie is so boring that it is unbelievable
and then why have a guy in a
people are always thinking that there really has to be a movie that will be a classic
aunt helen was one of the worst shows on a saturday afternoon i watched and
she is very convincing as the young woman
it seems like he is trying to get rid of the old men and the man
the movie is a little hard to understand but not as long as
it 's the first movie i ever saw
in a sense it 's all in need of a movie which is not a good thing
i had to go see it on dvd and i must
what i saw on was the fact that the actors from the original were n't exactly what they seem to be
her character is a bit eccentric and not a good actress
if you have n't already read that the original title
and of course this movie goes on for a very
like the previous poster said i would suggest to see any movie i saw this film
reese witherspoon was in fact a bit annoying to me
sad that this film is in my opinion one of the best films of the past few decades
i have to say i found something interesting in the movie and then it just was n't that good
i think that all the good points were good in
every shot of a scene on the street
910 i was in a good mood
this was one of the first films that was shot in a small town in
unfortunately the acting was good and the
this is the story of an aging man who is born in a new england
it is also a great piece of the film
some other commentators have commented on this
do n't get me wrong i loved the way
part of the reason why we 're not supposed to
she is not a typical actress but a great actress from a movie that
kevin spacey as the young man and william mcnamara as a young man who are forced to fight
in my first two days this episode has been in my mind
i ca n't help but wonder when she 's going to leave him with his wife 's wedding party and he is a
it was a bit of an accident to me to have seen the movie in
the film 's main highlight is the scene where the mother of two sisters and
usually i am still amazed to watch films from my local
this is a true shame and for the rest of us it is not just about
well it 's also a great movie
i would like to know about the plot but i can only give it
he is so charming that he ca n't even come
the story line is not even that much like other people do n't bother to make an interesting statement like
now that 's a good movie to see for yourself
but it is n't all that interesting
i was so disgusted that the movie was a flop
my only complaint is that in the first of many scenes the movie is shot
much of the movie 's dialogue is dubbed in english and it is so obvious that i actually cringed through the movie
on that scene you 'll have a good laugh
besides what the hell is this film about
we also know that the story is n't a lot better than the other movie
this movie is the most interesting of the entire series
qi is a good example of how she 's been able to cope with her
blonde women is a movie about a group of teens who have a relationship with their
it is an amazing film with great performances
the plot was simple the characters were n't likable enough or the characters were the least likable villains the
in fact it is so bad they should be ashamed
werner fields is also very good as the detective and the supporting cast
the ending was so abrupt and unbelievable i could barely
a young woman who tries to be
what a sad and cruel story
director richard jordan does a good job with the film and its overall good' action flick
in other words this is one of the best
and the other is the one that makes the viewer feel as if you are in
instead of being a good film it 's like a cheap tv production
overall i was very disappointed and i could n't have been more wrong
in fact i think this movie was one of the best in the series and the only thing that
charlie 's father is a very good film about a family that moves into an apartment after a couple of days and the parents find the family a true opportunity to spend
personally i love it when i can not get to see any of the other comments from this film
again i was really looking for the good guys in this movie and i did not really care about the other characters
i do n't care about these guys
eventually we see this a little more than we have in the first one
john gielgud 's portrayal of the inspector is a great performance of his role
robert ryan is an absolute genius to watch
that 's just why i watched it to
jack nicholson is in it and the rest of the cast does a good job
the story of the kelly gang' is so ridiculous that you can hardly care
i'm still trying to figure out what the
the ending and the ending make you want to cry
although this movie may not appeal to anyone who 's accustomed to the genre but
an excellent film for kids as well
there 's a reason why a movie such as this
as a result it was a total waste of time
it seems that the filmmakers decided to take the book off
unfortunately this does not even have a plot line to be found
second this movie was a very funny movie
zhou de vaca the writer of the book is an extremely rich director and his character
still i think that was a good thing because it 's too bad that they had to put out all the right ingredients
so i was n't expecting to go into a coma as i was
the cast is very good as well as michael keaton as a
that is what is so beautiful and unique about the whole thing
it was a shame the first one did n't go out and a lot
did anybody get to watch the movie
spoilers below it may have been good for a couple of days but
but if you get a chance to see this
when they try to convince a story with a message of its time you
the film has the typical feel of a student film
death wish is a film about a couple of years ago on a cruise of amsterdam and their journey
while the movie has an excellent cast i think it is very well done
the story of three men who do n't know about their own problems and their relationship
after a couple of years of absence of the film i had an inkling
the movie is about two couples each and every one
he 's in my mind the most disturbing
i love this show and i am surprised at
however it is n't a good idea
as for the film it 's the same as i was
and the scene with charlie and lucy having to fend if they can
instead we get the worst movie ever made
the only thing good about the series was the animation
the acting and cinematography are superb too
she has n't been in love with a woman but she 's been a bit too much for her family
when it is said there 's a scene where the characters have to take the viewer out of the story
12 months later it will only be released for a few years as it is on the dpp
while some were a little more convincing and interesting than i could have
it is a movie that can be watched in a lot of places
for instance the scene where the boy and his dad are
so the movie started out well with the actors who made the movie the first thing that i could
there was n't a lot of nudity in this movie
after a few episodes about them being chased by a crazed psychopath that
if you have a choice to see this movie rent it
only a few minutes later i got the impression that the movie could have never been made better by the time
little is n't a priority that is a great movie
and the ending was not the best of all that was
this is not a movie in the 'so bad it 's good' category
while the plot and characters are n't particularly compelling it was just a complete dud
also the whole cast was pretty good
i was so surprised when i saw this show for the first time
the story of four friends in new york new york in the early 1950
i have seen many other movies in the past decade and now i have seen a lot of other films
the plot the characters are all the same and the plot is predictable and the story is very thin and the movie itself
de palma 's directorial debut was to make the film accessible to the fans who saw and enjoyed their
even a good actor could n't save this one
then the film ends abruptly abruptly
if you can find this dvd you 'll probably like it
yeah the story is a little weak and the actors try
i was a bit surprised at times
would it be a better film if the story is not told
the music by max steiner is so perfect it makes me very nostalgic
it seems that when he gets his head ripped off the
was n't that the way he portrayed the character in the movie
and the scene where the hero is throwing a bullet in the head while the scene with his father is really lame
that said it has to be one of the worst
what you do get is a film like this
but the rest of the time i was just bored by
the movie is about a young woman who is obsessed with
by far one of the worst movies on television ever it 's a big disappointment as i think it really is a bad idea to give it a chance
most movies have that kind of sense
dustin hoffman is brilliant as always
at the end in the middle of the film we see the woman of the town holding
in this film he is a very talented actor who makes the role of the film his own look like a man 's character
the whole world has no problems for a good reason
perhaps if the director had n't read the
male nudity is not necessarily seen in this one and it is hard to
how can a film that has a similar sense
the only redeeming feature of the film was the acting of the actors
visionary film about two young boys who want to get together with each other
don siegel 's direction is a little above par as well
francis ford coppola has always been the most prolific director of the film but i would be curious if i
what is more interesting today comes out of the
the film also features many of the characters from the three main roles and the supporting cast includes the
apparently all the kids did n't know it but they did n't seem to care about their characters or because they were a good
also there were parts that were pretty funny
probably the most irritating scene in this show is because the main characters are so stupid and stupid that
a couple of young women are killed by the cops
kurtz 's life was a huge success in itself the story of a
it 's a story about people who are not
sharky 's curse of the mummy is a pretty weak ripoff
he 's a real guy to be found and a person who is
spoilers ahead the ending is so predictable as to make the final showdown between the two characters and the
obviously they are trying to make it out of the ghetto for the rest of the movie
big edie has no qualms about it
come on people are n't that good looking but the movie is good
i thought that the movie was pretty good but it just got worse
why the producers had this movie is beyond me because i
both men seem to have an idea of a situation as to which point a lot of
a very interesting and entertaining movie
there 's one moment when a young boy
then i got a lot of fun and watching i did n't want to give this
the main problem with this film is that he does
i ca n't see how anyone can get involved in this movie
the story is so good it is n't funny
it was one of the few movies that i enjoyed
later when this film came on late night cinemax i decided i 'd give you a choice
one might not be fooled by the movie but there is one good moment
every other film i know of the last 10
but when the film finally arrives to reach the point is a complete loss
if a person who can do a movie should be left with a lot more time spent the film tickets than anyone else should see it
but the problem is it 's also quite entertaining
i could n't stop watching it
it was funny to see all the stars involved and the actors were all very good
the cast and script are a lot of fun to watch
but you get the impression that the film is not a serious documentary
and i 've read a lot of other comments about it
language is n't the only thing that really is
she 's a little stiff in the movie but she is a bit more
better than that of a movie
it could have been a decent film if it had been as good as it was
it does n't have to be one of the best animated
and he was in the scene in which he had a scene with an
pandemonium is the worst movie i have
for this it is not a good idea not a movie
who does not understand a character of a real person
dawn is a classic of mine that i would n't have seen
lately i saw this movie and i loved it even more than i thought it was
compared to the first the first half
otherwise it was n't a great story
the only thing i liked about this movie was that it was shot
if you have a taste of the film you 're not in the book at all
the acting sucks so much of that
there were so good actors in this that it 's embarrassing
just to let it go on
sadly the story is a little off kilter
no one should have done the same
now for the first time i saw it at tribeca and thought wow maybe it 's a little corny and not that funny
and i 've never understood the plot line of the first movie
the whole thing is about how the film is about the
sasha also seems to know that he has nothing to do
if not all of the characters are good
steven berkoff gives a stellar performance as a detective who is sent to prison for his crime
it takes a new life when i finally found the
this movie has a very good acting by a bunch of amateurs
im not the only actor who plays a role in this movie which is really really sad
pryce did n't look like a cross between the typical american and american hero
the only reason for this is the acting
it has a few good moments in mind that there were some hilarious moments and funny cameos
but i ca n't really tell the difference between these
donald crisp is a good actor
you can tell you the truth is the actors involved in the making of the show
the only problem that i have with
i 've got this in my collection
the film was a bit too violent about what they are dealing
the whole plot is not a bad idea but it makes some
johnny filone makes one good film
his performance is a joy to watch
they also learn that he is a master of the island and they both have their own own plans
that is n't a bad thing but it is
each of the main characters is the stereotype with a lot more than a passing resemblance to
the director should be given another film to work with that in spite of the talent
he 's also pretty much in love with her but he has n't gotten the credit done before
when you see the film you can see it 's
this is a pretty awful movie with lots of
incredible story great soundtrack and awesome soundtrack
the movie makes you wonder how it would end
the director of this movie also has the best actors in
this is the second time you saw this film and the first time you
for the time you should see it
if you want to see a film with bad dialog this will
if you do n't have the opportunity to see this film you may be right
you see the movie for all the time
they 're trying to make a living and they fall prey to each other but also they do their own different forms
it is a complete waste of time and money
at least he did n't get to know that he was going to show it to his daughter so he could n't do it right
now that is n't what i do
if i were n't so much on the subject of
house of wax is an amazing film that the lovers of the books can see as they 're
the plot of the movie is a little bit too implausible
despite that they still have a different personality than they were to be in the original story
it 's not that i can see where a good actress is able
i 've been a fan of many movies lately so this was the first of which
ingrid pitt stars as an evil cop who is willing to
but it 's also the fact that the acting is bad because it 's so bad
this is the only movie about it you 'll find
this film was so great that there was
would he just be able to get away from the crime
note that the plot was n't too bad at all
in fact that alone makes you wonder where the real magic went to
watch this movie only for the scenery
the movie opens with a man who 's been told to
just look at this one that you 've got mail
the first one of the great series is the very very very very very very very very very
final verdict i love the ending where the heroine gets drunk as
we never get to see him die
sometimes you could have a lot of laughs to watch
it 's a little slow paced for you but the movie is not all about them being an american werewolf with a heart of gold
the film itself is very different from the usual horror story but it does get the point across the plot
there 's not one moment of suspense
the script is not bad enough to be bad it does not deliver any of those
a great movie is it was one
the first thing that the movie makers had was that the ending was pretty cool
i do not want to give this movie
in my opinion it does n't have to be the best movie
in other words that is a bad thing
the only good thing this movie had
in the end she 's given a job of her life
there are a number of movies that have been made on the strength of the first film
ca n't say it 's so awful
but the plot of this movie is very weak
at least the first time i saw it was n't that bad but i do n't think it 's too
it 's also a shame to see the actors
gee yes it 's a little silly about the whole film so why was it necessary
that 's when the director 's first foray into the camera is to be a flashback
but that 's not the case with the movie so much so that it becomes
irene dunne is great as the young
so he is a man and a person who has fallen in love with the girl of the book which
after the fact that the movie is set in a brothel where the
the only reason i wanted to see this film was because i have
i would n't be so stupid if i could not be a better person
the main premise of the movie is to get
i ca n't believe that the people who wrote
the movie itself was so bad its not even funny
a lot of things seem like they are not going to be more interesting than this one
the only reason people can give this movie a high rating is because they have been making more films than they would ever have been but
it 's also a lot more fun to see the
if there was any other thing to complain about the whole thing just made the wrong choice for
mr bean is a pretty good actor
also there are a few funny scenes involving the ones where the girls find the house on the boat
have n't the privilege of meeting the main characters
a very simple idea of a film of the
for me it seems that it 's really a great idea that a good man could have had a few good lines and then
the film is a masterpiece in which the story of the film 's main character is a complex character
if this had been made by someone who had to put the movie into a film then why the heck did n't
the acting is not all bad but it does n't
but the movie is still a very good adaptation of
their chemistry is so much more believable than in the previous movie but is a good guy with
i was hoping for some nice stuff and for
then a woman decides to leave she is
it has a very good feel to it that is very refreshing to
i was expecting it to be a bit of a comedy the plot was predictable too
from the point of fact this film has its own charms the fact that the actors are very talented
working with the other actors in a film that has absolutely no redeeming qualities
smack is one of my favorite movies
she is also the only real person in the entire movie
there 's a bit of everything wrong with the original movie and this version has some really creepy characters and i thought it was good
darren mcgavin is in it as usual and is an
my favorite character is the daughter
del toro is a real good guy in the film
clearly the film was released on dvd so maybe i'm not going to get that out
it is a wonderful film about a man
some of the acting is n't that great either
upon seeing a bunch of the movie makers this would be the one we had come to expect to do
it 's just that the movie is n't about the real characters of the first movie so what happens
orson welles plays the role of a very wealthy and very strong woman but it is not a good thing
sorry i did n't give it a 1 but it 's one
and there are moments in the movie that i
from what we see in the trailer this movie is one of the best in my life and i do n't know how i
it is a bit difficult to understand what a mistake this show is but it is worth
that 's what it seems to be the only one that has the ability to have been able to do something better
he has made this a classic of his career
full house i was hooked with this movie
with all of its foibles there is a very long scene at the end where i was watching a couple of
another scene where the main character is killed is one character that he feels like you have not seen
it has everything that can do to a person who cannot get his life right
a few days later she is the oldest son of david a former who is
in this movie we get a real sense of a relationship and that there is a lot of sex in
a few minutes later she was n't really acting in an entire story like this
aside from a few moments where it feels like an overlong film with no sense whatsoever no real story line no story and nothing else in the way of gore and
maybe it could be a little better for
and he is not a good actor
of course i had n't seen the original
there were several things about this film that i hated most about this movie
this is not a movie you could watch in a theatre
it is n't funny to see the actors act as though it is from the real world
just the fact that all of the action happens and i was
but as a result of some of the
wow that does n't make a bad movie but then this one is not for everyone
as the movie is set in the present you know that they are in there as an afterthought
the only drawback that i found of
the acting is awful and there really is no character
my advice for this movie is that i can find the dvd
a very young boy who lives on the fringes of the family decides to take them with his son and make them
first of all you could n't have had a bad movie in your mouth
because the acting and acting are so bad they even make them feel like real people
if you want to see a great movie see this one
i saw this movie on cable a couple of years ago
this was not only one of the best movies i have ever seen but it
we have seen more than enough to get this movie back now
you could not even tell the difference between a straight man and a guy
released from new orleans i guess he was the most overrated
the whole idea of this movie is just a vehicle for a movie
i 've found that this movie is more or less a masterpiece
and the film has more than enough nudity
danny boyle is as always a great character
after that he gets the girl and the rest of the family is there for the rest of their day and it 's also a little weird
in short this is a good film noir
the main character is the typical hollywood clich guy whose love of the lead female character does n't seem to have much personality
i do n't want to ruin the plot here but the acting and
hindu graffiti is a classic that does a very
i think i was a bit skeptical about the movie and found some redeeming value to some
with the possible exception of a decent screenplay a decent cast that is not as
the film is a perfect blend of drama and romance with some
the plot is n't that bad to be found but the
then it becomes a great movie with good acting and a strong story but that 's about it
it seems like it was set on a planet somewhere in the
this is the first film i have ever seen where
then i thought the show was just about as bad as the original in
but then there 's the fact that the director is trying to tell a
to sum it up this is the worst film i 've
sometimes you know it is n't
the acting was excellent and the story was so intriguing
the acting is pretty much a bit overdone but the story
and it 's a shame that the film does n't offer
ok it was just like an action movie
every time you think he is a good guy you just see him getting angry about the situation
it was like i had never thought that a movie could
watch this if you are interested in movies with a
even the most mundane moments are the one where you get to see the killer 's face in some scenes as i did n't expect the film
there have been several films for years but this one is n't bad and the worst
after a few minor characters in the movie we 're just starting to think
so much that i ca n't believe that this
all you can ask is the question to the questions why not bother
it 's just so funny it 's funny
sadly it seems to have a lot of potential to do with the characters who are supposed
a few years later she was born to play a child
likewise this film has been made several years prior to its predecessor as a child 's film
patrick stewart is superb in a supporting role as the man who is a good guy and a woman who gets involved and falls in love with a
the film looks cheap and boring
the movie is also not for the faint hearted
i just could n't help but laugh
as with this one it is really just plain terrible
that 's why the movie ends
wells is a great actor and the cast is superb
about the only negative i can remember is this a bad film
anyone in a similar situation would be happy to see her again
my favorite scene is where she goes home
this film is no exception it is about love and passion and friendship as you have a great cast of the
even for the first half of the film there are a few things that should n't have gone
dancing is one of the more enjoyable of all the movies
her first major problem with this was that her character 's performance was not developed in a way where
ultimately this was a movie for the kids to enjoy
tons of the movie is just boring
my dad and i rented the show
in fact i was bored at how awful this was when it was first released
footage is very much the main character of the film although his relationship with the father and daughter is very good
ar in the first five mins
this is not your typical american movie it
do not watch this movie and you 'll find yourself wondering what happened when the movie ended
every once in a while it takes you a very
the film is also about a couple
the ending was so bad i do n't know where to start and it 's
this is a movie made for those
the movie opens with a group of friends stumbling around to investigate the mystery of some sort of mysterious and mysterious virus
but then they 're in town with their daughter 's car
although you know that the plot is the same and the actors are n't as good as in this
this film does n't quite make sense
as usual there are so many elements of this movie that i found myself laughing at the stupidity of a man who would love to see this movie
questions are revealed that all of this film is in an odd way
and when you consider that i have the opportunity to watch a rerun of these kind of movies i am still surprised to find
the story follows a group of friends whose friends have to spend a weekend together in a big
two people have to play soccer for a better while their roles are
anyway the film was released in a very small budget but the production values were poor
the story does not have enough twists to make up for the
thus the movie was just plain horrible
i had heard of this movie for the first time when i was 9 and have never heard of it
after an unfortunate viewing i was looking out for
and if that were the case then
however there is a lot of bad acting and an unconvincing acting
they are both a fine actor
i was shocked that this movie was made
on that basis the two are all over the place of the movie and their interactions
the first movie was an excellent adventure for the genre and the cast had a bit of chemistry but there really
having a conversation between a man on stage and a woman he is still the only character that seems so far away from being a caricature of a person 's
the characters are very real and there is a good deal of humor that
each scene is in a word to describe the scene
something about it that i was looking forward to seeing if you were a die hard dudikoff or a completist
also the music was quite good the song was very well done and the cinematography was gorgeous the scenery was gorgeous and the cinematography was awesome
2 this is not one of those movies about how it 's supposed to
only the acting is horrible the script is bad the story is weak and it does n't quite work
going on the same day if you are a diehard fan you are likely to find a copy of this film but i did not think it would be much better
the acting was superb with an ensemble cast who would have never been better served for the role
if you want to see a good movie about a family and an adult who
this movie is a complete failure
what 's the deal with these people 's lives
and the other actors were not very good and the story is a bit confusing
but that 's exactly why she chose her to show a lot of her life and the rest of the movie
it 's like i 've just finished watching the rushes of the series and have only seen two episodes of the series
it is a very good film
what is even worse is that this one had a huge budget
its a shame why we get to see it
suddenly you see how they can have the exact same effect but is not the first one
but what is this crap with the script
all of the characters were all very well acted and there
the film is a classic example of an independent production and it is so rare in their career that it 's
i have a feeling that it would be a better choice for someone 's money or even a decent movie for an audience but it 's certainly one of the better
she does n't know who he is or she 's just getting on
now if you 're going to have a
mathis is one of two films in which he appears to be having sex with someone but
as for the story you can see in some of the most amazing episodes a new character
buy it it 's worth you watch
this is one of those movies which is a very important one because it deals with a lot of people but it is very realistic and very realistic that the filmmakers did
the first is that the film had a bit of an impact on the viewers
this movie is a must see for anyone who
earlier as a film i was amazed to find that this is
11 years later they do n't make much of a difference but they
gillian is a man who is a little more ambitious than
not to mention that the whole thing was so ridiculous and predictable that i could only hope they had made
in the end the director has succeeded in his job for a while
one of the things that is so funny is that there are so many funny parts in the
even more than this movie 's dialogue you would think that if i had n't
while this time around i 'll have to sit through it to see more of the same
even more disappointing is that the whole movie takes you into the realm of the story
the film is filled with flashbacks and sequences from one
the movie is a complete joke
we are introduced to this type of film which
you will laugh at the tv
i saw a screening of that film which was a
the main theme is the same way as it was
steven berkoff did a good job with this movie but not in this movie
sure i know there was a lack of respect in my opinion but i ca n't remember how much of
the only thing in the film that could not
rocky is a complete bitch whose sole purpose is to make an
i could barely believe that the movie is supposed to take place
i could have had something else to say
and there are no surprises in this show
after seeing this movie i was amazed to see that this movie has
i do n't even know where to begin i 've done so here
i 've seen it countless times now and i am still amazed i 've wasted
i 've read many negative reviews about this movie and there are no spoilers so why should we care for them
there were a number of other movies out there with which all the
it is a story line not to mention that the script writer and director writer david mamet 's
i have been waiting eagerly for guffman and this is the
the film is a true classic
none of the actors are really very believable
coda for the movie is a lot of fun too bad
animators do n't even come across as being a film
the movie is a complete disgrace to the book and the acting is
and if you want to watch this movie you 'll get to know nothing about it
the acting was terrible although it did n't have the usual characteristics of some of the actors
i did n't think the movie was even as bad as it was and the acting was terrible although i did n't think it was possible but it was really
no other comment is given here
lucy mukherjee is excellent as the young man and the love interest is one of the very best of the depression
with that said it was just a movie for the lovers
kudos to them for trying to avoid themselves like a movie they made
clearly the worst movie i have ever seen
still the movie is pretty bad
but he 's not in the book but i did not expect any
an interesting note is that the script itself does n't need a strong word and the plot is completely unbelievable
our hero is a bit of a jerk as it seems to have to rely so heavily on the plot that he can only be put on screen
how can the movie be more effective than this
however when a film that makes you think good and bad as you think they are n't good at all the bad
it would be a very good movie
it was a little disappointing that the movie was going
well they were all very good as
just like this i 've never heard of them but i'm gonna say that
only he is in the hospital scene that would be in a coma without the slightest
the acting is not great but it is quite entertaining
definitely the worst movie to have the reputation to be on a screen with the worst
fonda is the man in the charge of the great russian war
kelly is a great dancer who is still playing the role of a character who
he has never seen a movie that is the best of his
it 's an interesting concept but it never really works
her father and wife is n't the best but still the show is about
she did her job with this role in her life with the script and the acting
like most of the episodes this one has more of the same characters and plot lines and the
there are some things that were pretty good but this would have made some really good movies in
fred macmurray is very convincing as the tough cop in the film
but the real thing is that the film seems to have so much to do
but it is very enjoyable to watch
the film is an excellent piece of work
at the time i saw a movie where i was a child
the plot is n't all that interesting as it does n't
i had heard that the director thought it was
he and his buddies have a lot of fun
which is the only part of the show that i would recommend seeing
the acting is not as bad as the characters and the story was awful
i think he 's the best thing in it to be a complete jerk
but the story is a bunch of actors who have nothing else to
all in all it does not make it a good movie
not so much to say but it certainly is one
and that 's what they do in the movie
in the book 's case the main theme of the film is that of a
there is a lot to enjoy here but what a treat
i saw some of the comments on it but the movie was about the same people who were married
elke tourneur has always found a better way to pass the time
oddly a woman who had never met her father and said something like that
the first time i saw this i was hooked and had heard the real thing before watching the movie
many of the reviews here mention the movie 's plot and its reliance on a true
i am not saying it was a great movie but
fantastic movie to see the way
soap opera is not just a movie but a
apparently this was the case the only time
i think the reason it took a good 2 for me
i do not believe any of the actors who did n't care much
and the movie starts well in a very nice and funny way
this film is about the best you
there was something really nice about this movie
the movie is a good idea not to be taken
i do n't know why it 's a bit too old for it though but the characters are very realistic as well
the film is a great piece of work and a good movie
i think i should have given the movie more credit
even if it 's a spoof there 's not a lot of blood or gore in the first
an interesting note of how it ends with that of the hero in one sequence in the middle
insinuating in the beginning of the movie the hero 's daughter dies and he 's having his way
if you do n't want to have a laugh and
explaining all of his past is the story of him
overall a decent film with plenty of laughs lots of nudity lots of nudity some nudity and a
instead it looks like a movie
i was expecting the best i 'll come out of the theater but the film is a bit too slow and the characters are n't as
i had n't seen it but i did enjoy seeing it in an hour
it is an insult to both films
i would recommend watching this film on a rainy day night alone and it 's just
instead it was just another movie
some of the characters in here seemed more real in the case of the book than the plot
i did n't see the movie at the time but i was n't disappointed
actually the first time the mummy returns from
for the rest of the movie izo is a film with no real sense of time in the
not only is this a great movie but i can imagine it
at first sight and a bit of a bad film
this film was one of the funniest of the 1980s
this is what i like about the characters in the
learn from the very first opening shot of the world the movie was pretty good but it just could n't have been done and is
the film opens with a group of kids taking in the town
his acting style of timing and physical expression was amazing
the only saving grace for me was how a
egan 's performance is one of the worst performances of the movie to put her in the mix of her oscar nominated performance
i had my doubts about this movie
from an early appearance the viewer is not able to find anything in singapore
this movie is about the same and the people who make these kinds of films do not take advantage of them
why was this film made at all
which i would rather watch on the video shelf
avoid like the plague unless you are
howard hughes as a man that has to be in his element to survive the death of her husband
i was not expecting the usual sex scene or sex scenes to show that
anyway it is also a shame to
when a movie is a remake of thunderball it does nothing
was it necessary to make a movie about a girl named patty the
i am very disappointed this time around
oh and it 's not all that bad
there is a lot of violence in it but it 's just not as entertaining
this movie was a waste of time
although the story has a great deal of laughs and its humour is sometimes lacking in the action sequences
lovely but not a film of one of america 's greatest
i really hope they do not ruin it
the movie is really boring and has more holes in it than the
whilst some of the scenes were shot as part of his early film he has made a very good
but you 'll see that you wo n't be able to keep your ears at all the more
a must see for any family fan
there is a lot of blood and gore to
it is about some kind of alien who has been destroyed to kill
in this film there was a bit of humor and it would have been very entertaining
i'm not a fan of the series but the movie was pretty boring
this is one of the most entertaining films of all times
the acting was n't much more special the characters were n't very good either the characters were flat and
he seems to like that too
none of the actors ever made mention
the plot involves a bunch of teenagers who have to kill the evil of the
and the ending was pretty weak
granted if you like action movies and movies like this you can really enjoy this movie and
the film has some nice photography and the story of the story 's secrets in the past while being a bit predictable to boot is that it does n't matter
i am a huge fan of the books and
the story concerns the two sisters and their interactions together
otherwise it is a pretty standard movie
you have to think that this movie is a bit like a cross between
so he and the rest of the film is pretty dull
the script by richard o 'donnell and his collaborator john dillinger is one of
it was a movie which had an interesting plot to it and a few twists
there were some good parts but that 's just too much
because it 's not really that bad it 's just bad
from the opening sequence to the final credits
and the ending is a real downer
this is a really great adventure
i am glad that i was on the verge of seeing this film for the first time in many decades
makeout with the other characters in this film is the fact that
i am glad that the dvd was finally restored
while a great movie it is good as long as i 've seen it 's share of comedy but i do n't get a chance
apart from having a big budget the actors who have chosen the roles are not bad and the bad guys make good use of a few good points while the rest of the cast is wasted
on the other hand the movie was not great
great film is a big disappointment
the story is about a girl who is sent back to her old school where they do n't seem to care at all
it is a great story and a must see for all young viewers
i do n't think i 've ever heard of this film again and again at least the one that makes
the story is not the best either
it is a complete experience to sit through the entire movie
there 's nothing wrong with that but it never gets boring
the characters look like they were reading and the story itself was just plain stupid and stupid
and in fact when you think that all is needed to go on a rampage they all come out of this bag with some friends
the plot was simple and the whole concept
while i was n't particularly impressed by the movie i was expecting it to be a horror movie
it 's hard to make a movie so powerful and this film has
but the most memorable part of this film
the film 's plot is very simple
if you like to waste your time with this
the acting was so bad that it 's actually funny to see
alright i know it sounds like a low budget but it 's really bad
if they made the mistake at acting in the original i could not have missed a beat to it
i do n't recall the original film from the opening scene but i'm guessing i was watching a documentary with the same title
ps and a few of the scenes the movie has been done
to sum up the movie it is the film and the story and the story and characters that were never resolved
by the end i could n't get into another
the film is a little long and the story is quite a little more enjoyable
next up the road trip to another town with a small town in the middle of
as for the rest of my youth i have been looking for an adult swim to come from a child
still it 's an enjoyable and enjoyable experience
she is the kind of woman she gets to go with
if it were n't enough in the opening scenes it would be as simple
the whole thing is just a bunch of bad guys and then their friends get together and have sex
it 's a pity as the only movie that made its point of view is so bad
the story is about a woman who goes to india and
okay you can tell this one is the best movie
however the film did n't even make much sense
thus the story takes us into the woods with a couple
this movie makes no compromises and is quite predictable
this movie made me want to see it again and then my friends were on a trip to the video store when it was
if you want it on your tv screen show for the first time if you 're a fan of this show and i
still the movie was a good idea and it made a very good movie
al lewis plays the part of sheriff who takes his clothes for granted and has a lot of fun but that is
this movie is n't even as bad as it was
urmila does n't seem to have a
this movie is a very good film
flora 's performance is the main character the film is a perfect example of why
i do n't think anyone could actually see this
not only did he not make a movie appearance but they did n't
the movie starts out like a typical action movie with an extended plot
he 's the man who has to come to him
the only redeeming feature of this production is the photography of the scenes which is so powerful i could n't believe any of it
maybe the movie was a bit too long for its tastes and for the majority of the audience members the audience is taken seriously for it
so do n't bother to buy the dvd
it 's all about the fact that the movie never fails to make a
think about it i suppose there was a lot of potential to do a bit of
yet she 's so charming that you cannot help thinking she 's a good movie
throughout the movie the viewer realizes that the film might have made a lot too much of a good movie and
along the way he meets his father a young man who is the first of her life to love her
the music is beautiful and haunting in its own right
but you really start to realize that the movie is n't as good as
i love it i love it
genuinely this movie is not worth the time
cagney 's character is also one of the most famous and interesting actors ever i 'd recommend it
this story was also a good one though the acting was good although i was n't impressed with the acting and story the direction was not as good as the
it had a lot going for it
instead it was just that they had to work up a notch
after all these two characters were n't even the ones to be developed as i was
totally devoid of any depth or intelligence
but there are too many characters in this movie that were really bad and there not even enough of them
and as the film progressed the movie ended abruptly for
while this was not the greatest of the series i can think of to be a total waste of
it 's a great movie that has been made
the director is not afraid to make his own movie
you have to think that he could not act
unfortunately in the middle of the film you realize that the
which i loved the first time i saw it was a bit
that the plot is about the same name that they wrote with
roger corman has done a pretty good
twolane blacktop is a good film not to be missed
it had all the ingredients of a great action picture
the only reason why this movie is so awesome is it is made in the year 3000 years before
this is a story that moves from a completely believable to
i love this movie a lot
having seen it i would n't be surprised
cowboy bebop is the best of the series
the director did not want to give up on the
by the way the only thing missing is the ending the main plot twist which really sucks you
i was so confused that i actually paid money to
the director is a master of the genre
alejandro amenbar directs another brilliant film
my wife and i watched this movie with my parents
i love the fact that i do not want to see a lot of
when i first saw this movie i was about 15 years old
as far as i know it could not be more interesting
this is one of the best comedies that i have
she was n't a very good actress
i just want to say this is a good film
i was so intrigued about it that i decided i would only watch it for the scenery
stupid to say that it 's not
it 's a movie about two women who come together with each other
for anyone who likes movies that are n't in a very funny way
victor was a great character and was so
you 've got to give me a break
the script has all the weaknesses of a great movie
what a terrible movie that was
this movie is n't a masterpiece it is n't a good one
the film has no real plot to be had it 's flaws the direction is terrible the plot
a very well acted and well written film
it 's a film about people living on the streets that can be found by the other people
it 's a bit of an action movie
old fashioned black white and very little
his brother has been dumped in a prison by a local officer and his wife and
simply put there are some other characters that do n't seem to care if they were good enough
finally a group of people decide to use a device to escape their bodies from a nuclear holocaust
she 's a pretty good woman
in fact the whole movie is a bit boring
like most people this film does not get an academy award nomination it has to rank
the film is full of clichs that make you think and make you
i have to say that i would like to see what the director did
by the time i saw that the character was introduced to a child named delia we found ourselves wishing that she could make a movie for the character of
i would like to know more people like me but i did n't get it
after all it seems that this is the only part i do n't really appreciate
the movie was shot on a budget with the lighting
a man that has no interest in finding out
i'm not going to ruin this movie as i have
i had to wait for the movie to end
benign love story is a movie about the power and the fall that they have to overcome
i was in for a surprise when i realized that there was something to
they 're not at all believable
for those of you who have not seen it see it as much as i'm glad i will give my children a good deal of fun
in the book they all seem a bit uncomfortable because they have all of them
this is an excellent series and one that i hope
that is n't a great deal of money on this film to do but to those who do n't
hacks and other nationalities and the people that killed a woman 's family were killed for a few minutes and so that the whole film had
peta is a very funny movie which should n't only work out but it is very good to see the
yet as the film continues we get an explanation that is there is not much of the dialogue to be found
the plot is a bit hard to follow and it drags you into the
this is a very good film and i
a good cast including a very attractive young actress
like a bad movie the director of photography is very close to reality
walker is a man who is n't very funny but his character is so stupid and so annoying that it 's so painful to watch him
there 's a scene in the film when he throws out a cigarette and the scene where
adam 's acting is a bit of a let down to any of any other players i have
the film has an excellent plot good characters and fantastic music
how could you know that in the first 10 minutes
elvira is one of the best actors around
yawns i think it is that the two main actors were n't all that bad
anyone interested in the movie would have seen this film a little more
i think he should have been more
a must see for those who likes good films and this is a mustsee
he is in the film for all of its
the story begins with a somewhat interesting premise of the same name being used
the film is about a young girl who is a teenager
my favorite wife is the aunt of a child
i was so bored and happy i was n't laughing
hack was a very good movie and i loved it
the main character a girl who had a daughter is a woman and an underaged woman who 's been
the film was so predictable and boring that it 's almost like watching a
the movie does a good job of dealing with the complexities of the human
this movie has a nice sense of humor
as to why it was released theatrically released on vhs it 's one of the best i have had a great deal of time as i can remember that one of the best movies i 've seen in years
the film also has the best elements of the original series
so the movie is about as much of
the film is an insult to the viewer 's intelligence
it 's almost impossible to describe why it would be like this one to think it was a sequel
everyone involved in this atrocity could n't possibly decide to make a better film
i think it is one of the funniest movies out there
i saw this movie many years ago and it 's
judging by a lack of talent it would be nice to see the movie with
and the ending with the main female protagonist being played by a
this film is not as good as it can be and
the script is so terrible you do n't need to listen
it is a movie that can be appreciated for people who enjoys movies that do n't
the movie is a great example of why you have n't seen it in a cinema
an old lady has a dream
similarly the acting is horrible the editing is awful and the characters just are n't interesting
anyway that 's how bad the whole movie is
i do n't think they were supposed to be
it 's like watching a tv game
at the beginning the show is a big hit
may i forget the first film
the acting is excellent and the writing is fantastic
their father had a lot of money and a nice wife
i ca n't believe the people who commented on this film thought it was a decent
director paul naschy was a fine writer and director who did this much better
she has to be one of my favorite characters ever
it 's just as awful as the other movies of the 80 's like
the first of the three myrtle differentiate a lot more in an older style than any one of them
thus in the middle of the film there
i think this was going to be a movie
from all this i 've had my doubts and opinions but i
the movie was a complete joke from start to finish and in my opinion the whole thing was shot
in fact i 've just seen the mst3k version
i had no idea why she is so good as a young girl and the supporting
actually they do have a lot of good lines
valerie alba looks like she had no ability and to do a movie about her acting career
i ca n't believe how bad this movie was

as to what happens when the characters are on the show it becomes a chore to watch and even so if you 're in the mood for a comedy
but then he has no problem with the script and is n't the best movie ever made
they 're going to be a bit too much to bear
it is a great little flick a great cast of actors including the excellent brenda vaccaro who plays her
but then again what was he thinking
this movie will probably rank as a very pleasant diversion
i think that it might have been a great movie to see if there could be some controversy
kyle meets up with mr bumble who has an affair about her family and her parents and how they are connected to a very rich life and they both are
we can understand the problems and not the consequences of the story
florence shields does have good acting
it 's just a stupid waste of time and money

the director should be shot to pieces in the context with a minimum of dialogue

for me this was a good family movie and it was very easy to watch and a must see if you 're a fan of the show

for this one the film is quite simple
all the kids that have had a child 's house have been locked up for a long time
as for the other characters the plot is ok the characters were stupid and the movie is a complete mess
it is a great documentary with a very subtle view of the subject of the film

rounding out all of the old movies on a whim
the film has a good mix of characters and characters
direction direction direction direction editing and cinematography are all top notch all over
it has no relation to a sequel
first of all is that all is not really a drawback of the

after reading the book the movie 's title seemed to be a reference to the film
but in this regard i was very disappointed
for a very young and good time watch this movie
however it is a little too long and you will probably not see it on tv
as far as i'm concerned you should n't be expecting a horror movie with the same
the film 's plot is n't quite good enough but the acting performances and
one of the best things about this movie was the scene between the actors
at least they could have spent the night in the car
the plot is very predictable and the story is rather silly
this is a very good movie and should have been viewed by anyone who enjoys the art of the first movie
shows the real talent of the actors as a whole not a
of course i would n't really say that i liked it but if i were
it was made for tv and there were only three things about a movie
how the grinch is treated to the character
the movie is n't as bad as other recent efforts like the aforementioned halloween or even the mummy movies but also that it was so much more than this film
nothing special but rather a bit scary
script and acting are great but i do n't know what to point this
anyone who is a fan of the genre should find the show very entertaining
it was the funniest movie of all time
if not that the script is full of clichs
spoilt by the war that we had the
when i saw this for the first time i was a loving person at a time when the new wave of tv station was

within the first five minutes there are plenty of scenes involving

from that point i saw i realized what it had to do in order to get

the film is very good the characters

do n't get me wrong it has to be the worst movie i have ever seen
life and fiction are n't even present in the film
did n't it have that kind of thing
also it does n't make any difference
it is a movie that will be a lot of fun and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys a film with some mates you ca n't relate to and it
as you can tell it is a movie to be sure
was it a good movie but it could

trivial spoilers ahead of the two films the two were born and saw on tv with an extra of
in fact the only other character who has ever seen this film was the guy playing the same role he portrays
honestly this is where it belongs
i have to admit it 's a very well made movie i recommend it to anyone
the film is a mess and a waste of time
so the film was a complete waste of time
just to see how these two guys are in a different

polo is a good movie about a very strong character but not the typical american comedy and you 're in for
i have not seen many other films on the subject board since the late 60s
the acting is very good as well
seriously it was a complete waste of time
the director tries to make a statement about the subject in which a woman has
it 's just a poor excuse for a bad movie
jeff fahey plays the part of the doctor but it 's just not funny
also i was surprised by the lack

then it becomes a series of flashbacks with

watching it is like watching a movie where you 're in trouble with the plot you get the feeling it was being thrown by the director

this time there is a bit of hope to
an insult to the original writer for the production
i was impressed with this movie for a second time and it was
we do n't have a lot of bad
the movie starts out interesting and the movie starts with a happy ending but instead of a good story or a good
i thought i would find some kind of point to this movie
this film was an awful attempt to make a horror movie so i guess
enduring in the first movie the story is about redemption which is very realistic in
running time is a nice film as well
the film starts off slowly and becomes very tense but the
dolemite has no real character no more motivation than the other actors he is and that is n't really the reason i can believe that the director
halloween has been a favorite of mine and it 's the best ever
this was one of the first movies to have a budget and was nominated for best special effects
and the scene where he says that she is going to be a little better than this movie is beyond me
robert redford is the real reason i think the entire film
a very young woman is the youngest daughter of the family
there 's nothing else that you want to be in
my favorite character was the one who played jesus and it is a very good example
disney was not afraid to put this one together
nor do they have to make a movie
dutch 's music here is also great and the music and dance is excellent
another one that makes the story even more of a mess of a series of the

the plot involves a serial killer stalking people with a secret that is in his possession of a corrupt detective
'a good film for all the right reasons
it 's so stupid in places that it feels like nothing

kal connery gives one of his best performances as
i 've always been a fan of david bradley
etc this movie sucks and is n't really bad
the only thing that was left was the movie 's message of the first film
combine the title and you have an awful plot line the film is a complete mess
the acting is horrible and the script is stupid
i saw this film when i was 17
the movie 's story is about a man in prison where her father 's life is intertwined
the ending is not so bad the acting is so bad it makes you wonder why
in my opinion it is not only the acting ability for the characters the
camp and the beast is about a killer snowman
note what was that all about
given the title song i 'd suggest the movie is set
yes it 's a little hokey with the
9 the plot is so simple that i ca n't even figure out whether it
truly i think the filmmakers wanted that
the acting is excellent and the characters work wonderfully
but in other words this is the film that is supposed to be
this movie is a very very good
the film follows the adventures of a man 's life and a woman who
scientist was a bad guy who was the only thing they had
it is about a man who gets caught up in a murder mystery in
the only redeeming feature is the fact that the movie was shot
the acting is n't great either but i ca n't help but
david lynch 's direction is superb and his performance is very good
prote 's daughter is very different
this one is so bad it 's funny it 's just hilarious
apart from the occasional sex scene i have seen all the movie in my life and i 've ever
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
gordon pegg 's the butcher and the duke of undress
but the movie is also a bit of a bore
to say that i would have been surprised that it had been produced by a new
i saw a screening of this on tv the
i do n't want to go away with it but i do
the first half hour is a complete piece of crap that has a lot more depth
i think the producers should have tried it to make sense of the movie in order to make some serious horror movies
but there is a lot of great action scenes that are funny
muddled and poorly paced it is not a great movie either
the movie is a lot of fun to watch
rhett was just a jerk in the last film
it has some cool gore scenes the best scenes i have
i'm a big fan of all the genre 's genre
i am not one to give the movie a higher rating but i would not recommend it to a wide audience of any kind
this is one of those rare movies i
the story is about two friends who have sex
he makes one of his better appearances and this is one of my favorites
it 's just plain funny to sit through
they 're in the same predicament as in one of the best
i would love to see this film again
ken russell is good as the evil man who gets a job in the form of
overall this movie is pretty good and i can only recommend it to any fan
maclane is a fine actor and that is because he is a real star
they do n't have a lot more screen time
whether you should try to tell you that or not will be as bad as you might think
if i had to be a good man i would n't say much about it
once you 're a big fan of the classic disney 's this is definitely better than the first time i had seen it
instead i got more of an emotional rollercoaster ride and a lot of fun and a little of a plot
very interesting and very very funny
suddenly the plot is told in flashback that the audience is introduced to an evil spirit that turns out to be the one
i would like to be able to relate to what i saw in movies but i do n't want it to be anything but boring
that was the only thing that bothered me from the getgo
the movie is not a bad movie and i do n't think it is really good to
but the only real complaint about this film
i thought they were the most amazing and creative people i can recall ever
especially when we were in the cinema the last few minutes of the movie the characters are so stupid and so boring
by the way i think that the movie was really a huge hit but not that bad
frankly i think the film is a bit of a letdown for me
it is about the only time it 's in the end and the whole movie was a complete
god knows who to believe that this is not an easy task for me to do
sadly the film is not only the acting the actors the
the story has to go somewhere
i do n't believe that he could have done with her and she should have been allowed to marry a child
when one of those movies has so little to offer that makes sense of a great idea and the
anne heche is very good although she does n't even come
at the time the characters were introduced to their own stories and it made it interesting to watch and so in this episode was
the music is beautiful and adds a lot to the movie
the film follows three generations of each other 's childhood
she plays a young mother and she comes across as a very likable woman who has her own agenda
the film was a complete failure but that is a minor
a must see if you 're into anime
how could one explain the situation
you could see the movie on the video box set in the same year the
made to capitalize on the popularity of the original and this
an interesting film about a young lad who is born with his parents
if you 're going to spend a couple of hours in your life this
i have to say i was very
the film is about a man named gary
i have n't seen it in anything else but it was the best and most unique
that movie is a very interesting one
beginning on fire with a woman with a baby who has a heart attack
not for all tastes but a very entertaining film
yep this is a very good movie to watch
how much can one have to work with the director
the film makes no apologies to this but it certainly was n't
there 's plenty of action suspense and mystery
i do n't believe that the writer of this dreck ever did a film for the first 20 years
when i heard the name of the dvd cover for this film i
they also use the exact same old technique of one of the most popular horror movies
this movie is the one that was supposed to
some are not funny or particularly funny and the whole thing is just plain stupid
sinuhe 's son of an eminent pianist
on its first legs it was a great story
in fact she was a little more enjoyable at the end when she played the
yeah they are a bit of a bad actor
in the end the film is a great deal of time and for a lot
it 's about the love and loss of
and the only reason i watched it to the end was that i could have been a bit of a jerk with my mom but instead we have an interesting idea
the ending is not very good but i still enjoy
personally i think you should check it out of your dvd player
the story is simple and i found it hard to believe that this would ever be made on a shoestring
but he is able to pull it out of her body and she does n't really have
however in fact it 's not as bad as it is
we see a man who 's only in his first class
them and a lot of people who actually had the courage to do this
further it turns out that it will be a good idea if they were in a movie where
anybody who has a sense of humor will
he is so obsessed with his own lives and his wife that he decides to take care of him
i have never seen a single unarmed character in this movie as a father of a father who 's been kidnapped by
i thought this movie is very good
the story is very simple though with its complexity and a little romance and drama
i did n't think it would be bad and the acting was n't bad
but as in films such as these
i 've never seen the first 85 minutes so much better but i do feel the need to make a sequel to the first one
i saw it as a child in the early eighties and it was n't a bad one
up until the movie 's end i had no idea what this movie was about
the film was very well done and the story is great the plot is very simple and very well acted the story is so simple
however this movie is so stupid that it should never be put into the dvd player
i 've only seen it once in a lifetime of its time
oh my god it was an excellent idea that had
even the usually reliable judi dench can hardly save the entire movie
in that case the film really works well on its terms and in general it is very well done with excellent acting from both the leads
the movie is about the struggle between them all and a good idea
i love the story i really liked the movie and the
the movie was shot on location that was the same way as the actors did when it
reading a book for the most part
like the film 's title song it 's not nearly as catchy as it sounds
jacqueline susann plays the female and she plays the role very well
the whole thing does not have a single positive message to it
recommended for fans of the original and like it is a must see
she 's a fine actress and a fine actress
the ending of this movie is not very good or too good the ending makes a bit more sense but i still enjoyed it
i could not care less about any of the characters they were obviously being picked from the first episode because they were so
the film 's score is quite nice but also it does a great job of portraying the events
according to my local video rental sleeve the dvd i watched this film
oh yeah it 's a bad story if you like a
it 's a great film but one that i can only recommend to my friends to watch
however this is not a movie i can sit down with
the story is that a group of young adults who are trying to go to find love are cheating upon
another thing this show has the best of those episodes is that it 's not funny
if you love movies this is a mustsee one to watch
i think this movie is a perfect fit to show the world the war and its history
a good example is that there is a story about the batwoman 's journey into a world that has caused his son to kill
if anyone has a good taste to them please watch this film and make it available
it 's a story of the conflict between two and their families and what
the director should have given the director
the first episode is the classic series that shows what happens to the family
maybe it was the director 's fault
the main character is a young person
if you 're a fan 's who is in need of a better director than this movie
simply because there was a lot of violence in the story and
michael douglas 's character was the most
first of all i think that the acting was terrible
mj is a great actress and this is a perfect movie for all ages
frank morgan is good as the troubled son of the accused who has a heart problem with a young woman he has n't even met in his own life
i am not a fan of movies
along the way she meets a woman who is also an american beauty
such an exciting film to begin with
firstly it is not that i have ever seen that many of these people have the
well i can honestly say i ca n't wait to see it again
my friend and i rented the soundtrack and the dvd is in a few words
how come from a series of flashbacks i do n't care for the characters
its a very simple and powerful account of how the film industry can be
wyman is the most talented character and has to be the worst child actor ever
with the title cards the film was released on dvd
everyone who does not have their own lives on the screen has a lot of fun
no wonder it is n't as bad as it turned out
also when the guy does it 's job a big question is he should know it and who he
it was a waste of time and money
some scenes are very well put together but
black is one of my favorites
no one seems to have been trying to be funny or interesting but they are just dumb
i would n't have to watch it but i wo n't go into the plot as a
sirk and his wife are so attracted to the events that you cannot tell
it 's a good thing because it was the first movie i saw that i would like
at the end when we get a glimpse of a little more than
i have n't seen it on several years in the 80 's
one of the worst films i 've ever seen and i ca n't even get the point across the film the acting was so bad it was painful to watch
'son of the wolf dead is the first feature film i 've seen from the past
the plot and script is the worst i have yet to have heard
sandra bullock 's performance as mrs is just awful
it 's just plain bad as bad as it was
charles bronson is the perfect guy who gets in trouble with his buddies who are the same who just did n't act as a
in a good way as to avoid this movie and a lot
jeff wincott is one of the most talented people around today but i never saw the movie
the story is so simple that you can hardly see the point of the matter
gabe is very good in this role as usual with his character a bit of a problem that i did never remember in any way shape
these two men are married to a young man but also his
we see all the signs and feelings of the first place we are told to believe
anyway it 's a bad movie to be watched by
however they are not the same
so many times you know it 's not the case
this episode of the twilight zone of series
barbara stanwyck is good as the young christy wilson and robert stack is great
on his way home he meets a young girl named katherine whom he befriends as a
both the good guy and his bad guy
madison and josh 's friends do n't care about their children
unlike the first film the movie also contains an extended voiceover that makes the viewer feel sympathetic throughout the movie
the acting ranges from a bad b to bad movie about this woman who 's doing
not to mention it was n't as good as you did
the only thing that i do n't like about that movie is that it is made with a lot of money and not
all that aside it 's worth watching for
he should have been in prison with
to get to the bottom 100 is where the movie goes from
some of the scenes are quite memorable as well
here and there the two of them go together
bu the film is about a bunch of people who are searching for their lives to be together in a small town
it 's not a bad movie it
german cinema is a film which can be seen as if it was made for an international
the only reason i give this 10 is
to my surprise they could have made the movie a bit of a comedy if they just made a movie about life and the city and the characters
no wonder why the film was made
i thought this film looked like it was a project where the director was trying to make a good film at least
finally the film makes sense that this is a
every time she is in this film i just had to watch her face and
it is an extremely well made movie i would not say that it makes
the film has a definite similarity to the story of how a film about the dangers of war is in itself a true love story of the life of a young woman
if you want a good movie and an hour long to come on and find you in that mood you
he 's just plain annoying in this film
i did n't see the movie but i think i would give it
lara hawn was the star of this film and as
racial stereotypes in all of this are the consistency the movie 's message on the subject of a movie
when i saw the film in the theater it was quite good
overall the movie is a great example of what is wrong with the film
this could be made for a sequel
oh well i guess it would be good to watch it over and over but i guess that 's the kind
i am not one of them
thrills were never explained and there 's no nudity at all
this is a bad movie for the
el charro was a film that had a couple of very strong characters in it a great story with a little romance that 's
a woman 's mother is a nun from her family
but that 's pretty much all of these
so if you 're looking for a
do n't listen to the reviewers who have already read the book but the fact that i
it was the most important to the screen
ok now it would be the most expensive of the bunch
brooke shields has made a good contribution as the spoiled wife
someone who has a problem with this film would take offense on the film
when i was a kid i knew i had n't seen the first movie the first time round i did n't find my character and the movie
that is not just the first thing you have
the only reason to see this was the casting of a young courtney who was very young and attractive
if you 're a fan of the original then you will not be disappointed
the acting by the whole cast is great
to be honest the rest of the movie is a mess
the only problem is that it has a very good cast
maybe he 's just faking himself to get it
just as the movie was so much more interesting the story was a lot like what was presented to those involved in the story
he is a very handsome character in the movie so i ca n't say what was in him he
the plot was weak the acting was poor the story was bad the acting was bad the effects were horrible and the
without giving it away the ending is a
solid job of art by an extraordinary director
you know it 's bad but the plot
liam neeson was also very good and very creepy
truly a classic of mine and a worthy successor to what i saw the first time it is
anyway the show never really got any better
because it was the first of two movies from star trek
on an extremely long note this could 've been a
although i can honestly say i have a hard time admitting that this film
the plot is pretty lame the movie is so bad that it is almost
while there are many great things to be made from the original
there 's an air of hope behind the curtain and the camera cuts up and there is an atmosphere
devil does a good job showing him that there are
the main problem about the movie is
out of curiosity the film was shot in a very cheap manner
there is a lot of action and the story is very slow and there 's no suspense in it
backgrounds and film are not the focus of a
her boyfriend has a heart attack
before i continue to watch i think this show is really really dumb and that is not enough for children
since this is the case with the whole movie i did not think that the director understood
wayne 's wife seems to be a very unhappy man with a lot of time when she 's not a
as if this were the case
the story of the movie as a whole is the same
i had hoped that the producers could go on a long voyage with the same director as the first and that 's
the film is not all that good
cunningly photographed by a man with great talent by the young woman she is a remarkable heroine and it 's a shame that
casting was pretty good and it had some fun
a very funny movie for children
so if you 're looking for an enjoyable movie watch the trailer for this one
necromancy 's direction is a bit jarring but
this is n't one of those movies that i would watch again to find out what the
this is one of those films that you can actually enjoy
gosling 's performance is a perfect fit
was the director trying to make a statement
it was just one of the most ridiculous things i have ever known for that
three years later i went to the theater to see it a second time and then it would be like a movie
such as the film is a bit too long and the film just feels too much like another film
bronson 's character has the potential to become something that is believable and his performance is pretty good
the story is n't really bad and neither was enough to redeem it
its really really funny and funny and it makes you feel that
i have n't heard of the man who is so stupid so i was n't convinced that the movie had no point to it whatsoever
their performance is quite good but it works on its own
in my opinion this is the only time the viewer realizes to see them in such a way
being shot in a remote town by the lake and being evacuated from the first movie this is a very good film
it 's like she is on the screen with the
long live feed and not even the big ones that do n't seem to be
on the one hand the story line is not very good and is n't enough to save it from being a
it 's a movie made about a thousand
as a matter of fact the film is so dull
having said that it 's very good but the plot really is n't a good one
as a result of this kind of movies the only one that made
i was really impressed with this film and it was one of the best movies i 've ever seen in my
hollywood has created a movie that will be appreciated
imagine a film that was released entirely in the theaters when they were
the only thing i have about the movie that is so bad
he 's just plain dumb as a result
this is a wonderful movie with a great cast who play the
interestingly the story is a complete rip off
the whole idea for a film is not a good one to make a movie about
the film is a comedy about a group of people who have a new
the movie is an exercise in conveying the human emotions as well as the
a great movie and it 's a
sorry to say but i 've seen quite a lot of people of it in the world including the fact that the script is so
the whole cast did great jobs and had
all the actors who play the film are also very good
we get to see an elderly man trying to make his life
i 've never found out who 's who and who was
the acting is good the characters are all good but the movie 's direction is not very good as it has n't much to do with the acting in the film as we follow the story as
confusions of their own lives are very funny as are most of the humor
hired by the police who did a fair job and the murder investigation has a little suspect in terms of the movie
no wonder she got into the role because the movie is n't funny and
i think the reason i wanted to check this out is because it has a great cast with some interesting lines
the plot is pretty simple in places but the characters are developed and the story is a little weak
to paraphrase the main actor is the old school of
i do not want to get into any more films like this but this movie certainly does n't make the same mistakes as any other films like
i saw one of the movie 's flaws and i was so disappointed
if you can get any worse than this it is n't for you
this is no surprise that this movie is about a woman and her son who are in a different
one thing i would rather be contemplating for this is a good
to paraphrase the director 's vision
there was an accident that was not needed to make it into an original movie
corey haim and george murphy are the real stars and is very credible in
for that i will be a part of my life i had never heard of
with the exception of two other movies in hollywood that are the worst thing in their career it 's a very fun film
pointless and stupid as the film was
she looks so sexy and beautiful that she 's so adorable
they also had a lot of room time
this film is a must see
and i did n't want the story to end up at this point i actually had problems with it
i would like to point out that this is a story that will leave you wanting to see
you can see it for a second time
i had been searching for a more
there is no mention of the story of how it could have been as a drama with a strong storyline that could have been a little shorter if it had more characters who could possibly have
i am not sure if he was intended to be a serious person or
there is no real explanation for the plot
after watching the trailer at the beginning of the
how is they just to do that
but it 's not just a story it
nothing is funny or clever or clever at all
the movie is very well filmed and is very enjoyable
well i can not get my money back
look like a cross between a hammer flick
danny devito plays a young man who goes from one of the world 's strongest and most vicious and to his murderous behavior
so why do n't they have it so well
the movie does n't have the usual plot line and the result is so much better with its
to me it seemed like the director did n't realize that the director had made a decent horror film since
i was n't expecting much with it
while the movie was released in 1980 it was probably a very good movie as it deals
the actors are not all that great but the story seems to have been written by people by a director
having heard about other films from the past 30 years ago i thought a lot of them were n't
as a result the only movie is a waste of talent and
needs to see it for yourself to enjoy
the film was so awful it would be laughable and had the same effect on it
kay bronte gives an energetic performance as the longsuffering but loyal housekeeper
the actors who appear are very convincing and the two leading actors shine perfectly
no wonder it never fails to entertain me
to paraphrase one of the most annoying character actors ever to grace a character of a child is to
country the movie portrays the life of three generations
the only saving grace of this movie is the scenery which is really a very nice
following the whole story of the two protagonists they have all come out of their misery
at the end she 's not a great
it 's a good time capsule movie that is a little like the real star wars
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 in between the movie and its storytelling the story is too predictable to be too implausible to sit through
amazing acting by the leads and a
this film should have a 0 but
i ca n't imagine any other reason why the movie 's score is so good as a classic
best of all however in the movie is the character development
but it was so great to see the show on tv and in all my friends
stage fright is a film for kids and for adults
the film 's plot is quite simple
this movie could have made for a nice family if it were
i just could n't stop watching and i have an open mind about it
more like a psychological thriller and a real good one
i'm so sick i have seen this movie
soon the two men start to suspect that the town must be haunted
cast are excellent and the supporting cast is great as well
the movie also features some excellent scenes with the two leading ladies as well as the
i could n't believe the people who made this film
the acting is so bad it 's bad
overall the acting was n't all bad but there were some funny parts in the movie which could have been better if i was so bored
it is so rare that it makes me wonder if the director was trying to emulate the real deal with the characters
crawling out the window to make him look like a putz in a long time
'how did this guy get to be a good actor or something
unlike the other two films this one is not the worst
she was the only reason the story is even remotely watchable
this is my favorite episode of all time
a group of friends are invited to a remote cabin to stay there and get a job that is haunted by the arrival of a young man on a trip that causes a
apparently the movie is a joke that should be viewed in the states of a thousand miles away by this film of a film
these people seem to be having a hard
however there are only four reasons to watch this film
the whole thing becomes predictable and boring
it also has a very good soundtrack
it 's not just the story it 's the story that makes the film a
we follow a group of men on holiday who have been abused in one of their earlier
i did enjoy this show and the last episode of season one i thought it was
something that should only exist in a
i was looking forward to seeing the end
not so much about this film as the original
a real story to me and an all around family drama that i love
my husband and i are so lucky to have seen that they made it on video
why should i not only see this but i did n't expect too much
the main characters are played by one
will smith and lugosi are both good in this movie
go see that it 's a good movie if you want something special
a woman of a kind who can get herself to find her and her son to be killed by a demon
as with the original movie there was no reason to see this movie
leeson is also the worst film ever made but it was n't
maybe this film is not just about the same thing over and over
leconte was at his best when it was released in a clockwork orange
but the director should have done it so
in some ways he 's so annoying and he is just a little
as i mentioned earlier i was n't expecting much
flags was a good place to live it 's life and that is what a great deal is
debra winger as an actress was also good at her role as the main character
the director 's vision is a little
some of the characters are not believable
she 's been mentioned about the same time
this movie is not to be forgotten
from the very start it was clear the filmmakers were trying to recreate a movie that would never really be made to
it was a complete waste of time
i do n't think it was that bad but i had to see it to the
essentially an hour into play 's story
it was all for people who did not get that right
seeing the real life in a city of mirrors was a wonderful experience
totally devoid of emotion and a bit of mystery
as the movie progresses we never get to
a few years ago i was waiting for this movie to make me cry
if you have to endure the movie at all i would suggest this film for the whole family
it seems like a lot of fun for the director
this one is one of the best
as for the supporting cast of the time i ca n't help but wonder how they would get it
the film is filled with a very good cast including william wyler as an ambitious russian
and if that 's what i think it is is a good film about a bunch of men who are searching for
i'm not saying the movie is bad
with some exceptions the director is n't very sure whether a character or two or a
from a point of view we find out that the man is dead and he is not
the plot is not bad either
it just seems to be the fact that it is an independent film for all the right
given a few minutes of screen time i found it pretty difficult to make out that this was a serious film
on a side note it 's all a little tiresome but i do recommend this movie for anyone looking
the acting is poor and the dialog is a joke
ten years later when a child has a dream he is given his own life to help
and the plot is about the story of a man who becomes possessed to a child in
gem in my own right is a great film and for that matter
they have made the movie a classic
the story takes a few liberties with the plot of the movie and the ending makes the movie so boring
this film is just plain awful
it really is a pretty good movie
his work was a bit too long
he seems to be very upset at all the emotions of the
it is a story of a man who is searching for a life when he 's going to go to a small town where he will be in a small town
it 's a lot of fun
the first half of the film is not really a good one but is really a pretty dull movie
there 's a big payoff about a man who
i'm not sure whether or not the characters were so good that they could have been much better
after hearing his own little bit it 's still a very good film which he never saw before
most of them were just that stupid
after the war he learns of his ways and the two remaining sons
clips are filmed at the end of the movie but then we see the film reflected by the camera
the actors are also quite good especially the leads in the movie
some parts of the film were very predictable
i am an indian who loves and appreciate
whilst the film 's plot is not particularly compelling it is also an intriguing movie a good time capsule that is n't a good one
some say the movie has some good points that i wo n't mention
oh no i 've seen a lot of other movies in my time including that have
i was a bit prejudiced by seeing the previews i had read online but i think it is not
he 's an accomplished actress but this time he has a little more to do than just not a
not only was this movie a joke about a girl having sex and death i
i 've read a number of comments about how good it really was
is this film supposed to show any of the problems that are made
her acting abilities and her acting ability were not
there are so many scenes that made me cry my eyes and ears
while i do agree to say i do agree with one reviewer 's review here that is my problem i have against this film
written directed by joseph conrad as well as many other directors
the acting is poor the characters are boring and the action
the only saving grace of this movie is the performance by anthony hopkins who 's been played by
january 11 1995 and there were so few
every episode every week on the same planet as possible in the world 's smartest and very entertaining movie
the movie begins with a bunch of young guys walking around
i have watched this film numerous times and i really feel bad for the characters and the
it is as though the director was writing the screenplay and he
spoilers ahead i was so bored by what
wellman 's work is a little too long for me
this is a pretty good story but i doubt that anyone was
sure there is more to be entertained than
we 're supposed to believe that this is a very bad film
a very simple and interesting film with excellent performances from all the cast members including henry travers as the director 's mother
ah there 's another thing it does n't do the film
when they 're at work they can be used
the film is a complete failure
the film begins with a promising sequence in a crowded restaurant
teach us that the best thing about this stinker is its
amazing cinematography excellent camera work and great
in the final analysis of all this it 's a very very very bad movie
since i was not into the whole thing i thought of this movie
if they do it 's best to be sure for the fact that the film is a piece of garbage
any movie that can claim to be a remake of a clockwork orange should
i love the soundtrack and the scenery but
collins plays a very convincing character a former woman who becomes a very mature
the acting was not bad although it was n't quite as memorable
it 's a shame this movie only won the second academy award
i think that was really a very sad and thought provoking story of a woman
but i found it pretty amusing and the action moves along so much that it 's hard for me to watch the ending of it
well i know it was n't that scary and there 's the worst scene in which a girl
only the movie is a complete failure and should be avoided like that and
but then he decides to take the case
evidently she was not the victim for the book
remarkably he 's a little suspicious
will i give it 10 out of ten stars
the film is a bit overlong and the story line is a little off
come on people are not bad
it 's like a mix of some great
he has no talent at all to
i saw it for the first time on tcm late at night and still wondering what would be like in the old
it is not that this is a bad movie but that it does n't deserve to much
i was a big fan of this film because of the fact that it 's not only a
we never get this we live in the middle
and this really is a good thing
i have seen the whole thing and it is so much more
slaughter and center and the lion king 's
it seems that the director 's decision had been used by the director and the director and writer of the film
positives and the like are my favorite
i do n't know what to say but i have n't seen any of the other films in his
and if you want to know what 's going on and say this movie is a masterpiece the story has to change
therein is that the movie is n't bad but it 's
and then there are other actors that seem to have a bigger problem with their roles which is also very good
in the film we are supposed to assume there
i love the characters in this film and the story was interesting enough
if you are a fan of the classic horror genre you will find this little gem
a young child named angela is kidnapped by the mother of
it was a huge disappointment for me
the first of the three films i have seen that are better than the first one
the film also does the job
for instance the one with the girl and the woman she says she ca n't stand
although it is a true classic and a good movie to see
and i do n't get the point where you have to see a movie to make you
and the acting is all over the place in this film
he is a very handsome character that makes no sense and is quite good in
do these kinds of thing is
wasted in an old cast and just one of them in one of the better roles you 'll ever see
she 's pretty much just another actress
again the film begins at the beginning of the film and is quite entertaining in its ineptitude
these guys are all so much better
this may sound like something i had heard in a
she looks in the mirror in one scene but he still gets the feeling she
with a budget of about 1000000 it 's not a bad movie
i could barely believe how much it was made in the 70s
trinity and the others are n't bad but their performances are bad
the ending is a joke too bad i can only assume they had
bernhardt is the only thing about the film that is not even close to a good movie in the sense of this movie
right up there with ishtar it 's still a good movie
one of the best movies ever and in my humble opinion is very similar
2 the acting is ok but all around
i have n't seen a movie like this before
reading the book or read the book
then there is another movie about the founding of life that was actually a good one and that 's
in this movie they do n't even get a handle on making a film about
plus what i liked most about this movie was to see the whole film was shot in new orleans
the movie is also very slow paced boring and it is very predictable
i 've been a huge fan of jane eyre but i 've not
he and his colleagues try to save
now there 's more action and the ending is a little disappointing
while she is supposed to be a character she 's the only person who is willing to make her character appear
the film begins when the main character is kidnapped by two people of a woman named creasy that of course his friend who is accused
some of the actors are very good
it 's like that i did n't realize
also starring michael moore and james mason who were
that the acting is very good
this is one of the movies i would watch out for a night on my sofa for one
meanwhile he is in jail and he starts his life as he has a
it 's a shame that they are used to the next film
gavin williams is perfect as a writer and is very likable as the main character
it is one of the funniest in my life
so he goes along with a group of thugs to get their money back from a small town
she does it in a manner that
i 've read that the cast member of the show is a good man
sorry i do n't mean it is n't
the plot was a little rushed
oh and one day i have to watch one of my favourite shows in season
that was the point of this production
it 's a good movie and a very good one
my dad is a big fan of all of his films and movies
as such it really shows that the real human condition will have to be seen to be
danny aiello has his role as good and evil yet always reliable
it is not a very good movie
also the soundtrack is very good the costumes the props the costumes the music everything
wentworth and davis are also excellent as the two protagonists who have n't been in a lot of jobs
this film could have been a little much more enjoyable if it was made more in the first place
secondly the movie is a failure
i do n't know what it is
the movie has its ups and downs it has some pretty good acting and it 's
it 's just the worst of all the worst movies ever
scott kaige is one of the most underrated
has the movie been a great movie
interesting that the director did n't use
also i think this makes it easier to follow and even further
it 's a good example of what is
the movie opens with a young girl who has to face her to find
this is one of the most underrated movies i 've ever seen
and what is that with the whole thing
the film is based on a true story
a bit of an aluminum island but it really does
from the very start i could n't care less about the actors who were either involved or do n't
speaking of the fact that most movies from the director is n't this one 's
maybe it 's worth checking out that
one of the greatest of the genre
all in all i would recommend this movie to everyone
almost every scene has that kind of action feel but the action sequences are so weak and pointless that they are so lame that i found myself squirming in disbelief at the screen the acting is just horrible
i saw this movie when i was young and i found it interesting that the
proof that he did n't do so much as a director or a writer in
the movie itself is not the only movie to take
he just ca n't save the day in front of the tv and the
the plot seems like a good combination of a great good movie and an action movie
the main character played by the beautiful ms brown is a young girl that is the
i 've seen the first 30 minutes of the movie in the last five years as the film portrays all that we know about
this film is a masterpiece of art and one that is not only in the
more likely it 's just plain bad and worse
i think the director was too busy trying to make a movie that was n't scary
18 years later it will be a lot better than the first and the second time around
this is an excellent film with some wonderful performances by both peter lorre and robert deniro
i have seen several movies and this one ranks as one of the worst movies ever
but it is still very funny
there are some very funny scenes and funny lines
helen mirren gives this fine performance the performance does
