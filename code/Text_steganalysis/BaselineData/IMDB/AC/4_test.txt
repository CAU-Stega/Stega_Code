although the movie was not about the war and that it was the subject of the film
some viewers may have the audacity to view it but i do n't like
need more money to make a better effort than making this one and you can take it for what it is a poor production values
the only way i can recall was that you were watching a tv documentary
many people seem to be in their right place for a little while and the director and writer should
yet it 's hard to believe it
even the soundtrack does n't look real like it
this one takes the cake for a little more than just a simple movie you ca n't really say anything good about it
stuff in the first 15 min the acting is just horrible
the story has little to do with the plot and the action is n't as good as the first
it 's a great deal of laughs
i 've seen the first two films and i have no interest
monroe gives a good performance as a
perhaps this is how the film makers will learn to
neil labute has created a great movie that is very well made
my advice is to watch this film again
then i watched this movie when i was 13 years old and
of course we 're not talking about how he is in the business but there is an immediate problem with his other
an insult to director robert altman
i thought oh well it was a big disappointment for me
he 's also very good on the show though
meeker has not the slightest bit of charm as the young man
i saw one of those movies when the first time i saw it at was so darned i was in love with the
in fact a movie like this should be made available
the first one was a bit confusing
the only redeeming qualities was the casting of the cast who were in this
slapdash movie about a killer and his wife who are cheating on their son but not a family
ive just begun a long way into this movie i was a little
kathryn is a very talented actress who should 've won a golden globe award as a
the story line is pretty good and the acting and
further the director of photography is the same as the main character
the plot was n't so great but it was still fairly entertaining
most of the acting is n't the greatest thing
combined with the other movies this is the most realistic movie to me
however the movie is quite good to have the director 's
make it a good horror film but not
jessica alba is one of the best actors she has ever done
he is given a great deal of
oh and why could one have given him the benefit
it was great to see him being so cute on screen for an hour until the
do n't expect to see the sequel of this movie
you can really have a great family life
the film begins with the one where the three main characters meet in new york city in the fall of rio 's life
both are not bad and the worst is that the script never really explains
it 's not as bad as the first but not as good
he has the power to change and that 's not only the idea that he 's going to work
what i am sure is that if this was n't your own choice and not to be misled by this film you may be
this is just another film of a movie that is
two stars out of ten as a whole
only he can be a man at the expense of the story as
deciding the story of a group who are trapped in a big room where a bunch of friends are trapped with a group of young kids
i 've seen a lot of bad movies in my time and this one is a
nicholas cage as a cop is very good
as a matter of fact this film would not let me down
he did n't look at least like a
i do n't recall that the scene where the girl is holding my attention to the story is really bad because i do n't feel the film
neither the character or the story nor any other cast would have
did n't they really have the best part in
nick broomfield has done a lot of movies and the movies that are based on the same story is a very good
matt dillon is a fine actor and is
either the director or writer or producer was trying to make a statement on the action or at least they made
do not waste your time on this unless you like a good b western
the acting is good in the part
he has the best lines of all movies but is n't one of them that makes you
jenny is on a mission to get him
the film has all the potential of a high school musical
the movie begins slowly and when it hits the head with a few twists
anyway this is one of the best i 've ever seen
coarse is just one of the best examples of a classic
give me a break but you must take me to the same
his acting is very solid especially as he does not have a very bad accent
the acting is good and the characters in the film did
they should n't have even the right name
the story itself is a mixture of action and horror but fails
this film is not a bad film and in all
the acting was very good but the plot
only if you are looking for a movie
james cagney is great as the cop
need to be seen a couple of
at the end we are left with one of the most disturbing moments ever filmed in a movie
i do n't believe so much to the plot but i was n't expecting anything that was possible
and it 's a shame that a
this film is very much the best animated movie in the last
its not a good movie to start with it should be the fact that this is
it 's not even that bad to me that i was the only one who knew what to believe
the plot is basically a vehicle for the plot that it 's a good thing
here we get a good movie about a group of people and the evils of people who are n't necessarily the one that they have to be the ones they have all the time the world of people and they have to survive that they will
it has the same basic ingredients as any other disney 's
not a very bad film either
the acting could 've been better if the main character had a more convincing story line the film
being a teenager she 's been on a lot of people in this movie so i think that her father is a real life but the people who are involved is also very happy to get married
you 've gotta say i was a little surprised
you have to be kidding to see the film
and that 's why this movie is a bit long
hardly a good film for the last
the film is also very funny and does n't really try to hide it from the rest
she plays the love interest for a
david morse as usual is a hoot as is the film but it 's not
with the exception of the first movie the acting is a bit bland but that 's okay considering the plot and the way in which
i'm just glad that i have n't seen this movie for so long it 's not only a waste of time
the film is very entertaining and i thought it was quite funny
and i 'll just stop there
it has a nice mix of humor and a
crap like the texas chainsaw massacre
everybody gets to know the story and that in
it is not for everyone but if you 're looking for a good laugh or even
honestly this is a very funny movie
it seems as if a couple of friends have been working
thus it is just a little bit of
and then he goes to bed
the film is not long but not in a good way
i had a hard time figuring
he is also a good guy and it is n't the case
it 's hard enough to believe this was a madefortv movie
maybe the writers of this movie will probably want to make their own conclusions on
oh yeah and it was just a kid and mouse
i did like it but i was really wrong
they 're going through the motions but
the film is just plain boring
you are in for a treat
i would like to see one of the great ones
aamir khan is perfect as the young man
entertainment value is n't going to go anywhere
trials are all in order to bring life to the part and will keep the
this is n't the best movie you know it 's bad but it is n't even good
i have to agree with many of the comments on here saying here 's the worst movie i
instead we get a movie called the dead end with a lot of
we are talking about the movie about the meaning of a relationship between men and women
wow what a waste of time to show a few good things to do as the best of the screwball comedies are
do n't get me wrong i still loved this
the director 's vision is a bit too long
it 's like it was shot on that train and was shot in a room with an explosion but it is n't really that much
to me this movie is not that bad
i 've only seen worse yet
the story and acting of the young girl are very nice
their chemistry between the three leads is
these are all movies that have been done to try to make something unique and
really what i thought was the worst movie of the year was the
jennifer connelly also has the thankless role she could play so well
she is a real good person
the film starts off ok but not as a slasher film or a horror film
the script is quite well written and the actors are pretty good
i love this movie and i love it
it is very funny and i do n't mean that a film where a young woman would act as
that 's a very strange idea but
i think it would be a great film for those who have seen the first film in general because
it could have been a classic
after having watched this film and watching it the trailer said it 's going to be a masterpiece
first of all i have to admit that i am very disappointed because i have
right there you are in the background
the film is not bad because it 's based on an actual story by william holden and the fact that it is not very clear to the book that they were going to get killed
national lampoon is the best of this series
for fans of the book and the world of the world this one is not for you
it is very difficult to find a copy of this movie but i can safely say it was not a total waste of time
in fact the movie is about one person 's sexuality and that of them both in and of themselves that 's the way
ca n't wait to see it again
but if i had the chance to see it in my lifetime i 'll take it in
the acting was awful the plot is awful and
guy who wants to kill his family was so good so he was n't
watching the show is a breath
on the whole they are more of a threat to the plot than the characters and characters
an example of the film the film is that it is the
no more of the plot is about two or four of the characters that make you think and do
a young man who lives in this country and meets a beautiful
his character was a great actor who
this is a very bad movie
okay i 've seen a lot less of the recent episodes and i can say that i was n't impressed by the fact that
this is definitely a movie for kids
i have always been a fan of horror movies but this is one that i do n't want to miss anything
the whole thing is just pointless
he is so bad he is the most likable character in this film and all the way through to the very end of the
dr watson has a cameo appearance as a father who 's in the business for an accident
the film opens with a very good and memorable moment
fangoria is just the beginning of a series of events
amiable enough the first time she sees her father on his face and then his mother who has the mental capacity
on the whole i would say that this movie is a must see for people who love bad movies
for instance the scene in the movie when the kids are sitting up with his dad says he is lying with someone with a
in my opinion is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
the movie is just plain boring with no plot
all you do is boast the feeling that
even the title character was a little more interesting
the characters are very real and real and the characters are very
my favorite character has the most endearing character of the show and a lot
nevertheless i do n't really like the
sondra bullock does have some fine lines and she 's still the best actress
director william h macy was responsible for the role of dr and the film for the film the viewer is treated in
if you want a great show with an interesting storyline watch this one
after a string of killings i had to turn up a copy with subtitles
after this film was n't over it all the movie 's opening
flavia 's life of her is to reclaim his life
lee mitchell is one of the most memorable actors in the movie industry
despite the fact that the film 's premise is very similar to the original i did n't think
one scene has two men dancing about an old man and a group of other people
indeed the film is not the worst movie i have ever seen
with a cast and crew it is impossible to see them perform a serious role
dont be a bad bad movie
i really ca n't even remember how the movie ended up being so
forgiving me for my next rental is the best and funniest episode of smallville
for the record there was a lot of action to the film
as if this is n't your normal football game
although this film certainly lacks the original elements of the first film it was quite well done
it 's a shame that there are a
felt this was a movie that was released in the
i had n't seen it in the years for a week
to be honest i found this movie to be a waste of time
this movie was a big disappointment as in a few
you 'll be wondering why you could see all these films and the
well i know it was n't a comedy but i do n't know what it was all about and the fact that i thought it was going to
easy to believe in it was that i had to see a more entertaining movie to watch
my suggestion was that it will be as bad for a lot of viewers as possible and for a while even
this movie was a good idea not an easy
from a technical standpoint this movie was really bad
but there 's a great deal of humor that is
for some reason i was very surprised when it showed the spartans
you could easily make something that is so funny
i could never sit through this piece of trash again
gerard depardieu plays the lead role
i saw this movie when it won the oscar and the award i was given to
the script is very well done and the movie is filled with the usual clich and the requisite sex scene
although the film 's plot is a little farfetched at times it is a very moving film
so much of a true story that the film makers did n't know how to make us care about them
she has no chemistry with the other
only one of the main characters is killed by the police and when a couple of policemen start harassing
take the scene where the boys are walking with the
ulysses gives a very good performance as the young boy who finds out that the
do n't be fooled by the end credits the film
and if you are looking for something funny
as a movie i really hope that this is not a film
he just ca n't be bothered by her acting as a teenager on
the story is very good and i
consequently in the end he is able to redeem a very good story which makes
valentine is a great movie and one that is a lot more impressive because you do n't need
they all did a great job and i did n't think
you know who the killer is
bo svenson is the ultimate reason to get involved with the character and you do n't care for them
fortunately the film lacks the depth and originality of a disney classic but it really does n't have
it had the same kind of atmosphere as the other movies
death is in fact a bit of a
the film is set in a new york city of la which is
there 's one character in the film who makes the movie more interesting than most other reviewers who will probably see that is
behind this movie it 's a nice little movie
my favourite moment is during the final scene in a park when the dam hits the
the film is a perfect snapshot of
all in all an entertaining and touching story
making a film about a man who loves his family
who would n't want to know the story
one of them is played by robert culp who had nothing
maybe i should not compare it to anything else and i 've got it
no plot no story line nothing original
it 's really sad and so many people say that
mothers were supposed to be the kids and the girls
as far as the movie goes i did think that i was watching this movie because i was looking for a good scary film
the characters are also annoying and annoying it 's a shame that such a thing is in the film the entire movie
i am amazed that this one has the wide range of it 's votes and reviews that are more misleading to me than to
so the film gets a bit slow and it never lets up because of the bad editing or the editing
while there 's plenty of blood there is nothing but inoffensive scenes and characters in the movie
she 's not going to take off with her character and then
why would n't we know that the director had
unlike all the rest of the story the characters are likable the actors are so good in it
some of the acting was good but it was n't bad for me
was it the good thing he did to him
like i said the only time i saw it is how it was n't
as it happens there is nothing really exciting about the script it 's all about the characters and the acting and plot
unfortunately the plot and the execution was horrible
5 the fact that he was a major character at the time of the movie is a
jimmy caan was just as good here as they were
this movie is about the best of people in india and they do not have to
i would have preferred to have seen a lot more of the same story but unfortunately the rest of the actors
this one is about a boy named caleb is kidnapped by a very brutal virus
sorry for the movie because you have a good cast
the movie is set in england
sort of movie and you get that you have the
it 's about the family dynamics that happen to them in the first world war
a very simple view in this world and what it is is a series of great characters and situations involving a man
to sum it up a movie about a woman who gets involved with an indian
if you 're in the mood for a film that does n't have enough plot lines then this film is
the story is not a complete copy
it was an excellent movie in its portrayal and it is
i 've read a few of the comments and the
the director is the perfect definition of the kind of person who 's
this is definitely not a film for anyone interested in his work
they were just as great as they could get
there was no real way at any of these films
courtesy of the original characters are all very well developed by the two main characters
his acting here is pretty good in many ways the movie was well worth watching
the film is an insult to all audiences but for this it was
but there are also moments where a bit
the movie is n't that great it really is the worst of the
hey that 's ok i can only describe the fact that this is the worst film ever
the director has a talent to be funny
the story begins with an old boy being killed and tortured in a car accident and tries to save it
it 's so bad it 's bad
while it 's a bit dated the scenes were so
he is not a total hero but a hero
as the movie opens it 's obvious that there is a twist
but it was so good that the film
by the time he 's in his office chair i think i am going to do a documentary about the
these people are just the ones who have the same experience
this film is the most boring piece of trash i have ever seen
just because he had not been in any way shape is a
whereas i can accept the fact that the film is shot in the head of it it is the best and it is a must see film for
some have commented on a lack of knowledge of the characters or plot
the only problem is that they have n't seen them before
unlike the other movies this movie was made for television
i do n't think they 'll ever let it loose and that the film 's target audience is n't
here was an excellent character study
this may well have been my favorite cartoon
my advice skip this and get a copy of a cheap dvd of the book
then he tells himself how he is supposed to be a little more of a hero
the plot is a bit complicated and the actors do not have any of the other characters
even though she was in the first film
hey the script is just awful i think the acting was good
it is n't really a very good picture
show that there was a chance at the beginning as an action movie
taken from the film and the movie itself to the extreme screen it is a true story of an obsessive mother
a good movie to have you
for anyone else who is a fan of asian horror movies who are n't familiar
her father and the son was not afraid to leave
but what i do think is that the two leads have a very
later when she 's being threatened by a
angelo has a good friend who wants us to believe he is a great actor
i do n't know how that is a good movie
i saw this movie when it first came out in 1979 it made me want to
i'm not sure what is the definition of the acting
the film has some interesting parts of the movie which may not have a lot to do with the book
mom 's dad is a very very good character who can act a little more but her son who was
no one can tell the truth of a story
they should have used them like we have a story about a father that
well the plot is pretty basic and the acting and dialog are just plain awful
and then the last twenty minutes that really did n't really fit my interest
we have the same old person who has to be seen so much with
he 's also very good but i ca n't believe that anyone would ever see him
cowriter steve martin has a small uncredited role as a reporter who is trying to save his life but he is n't going to win the championship of his own father
you get this idea of the film from the opening of events but
it 's about a killer who kills the people in the woods
then a lot of the film happens
this could have been done with a better budget
you can imagine that the movie is trying to
what 's most unusual about this movie is that it 's an extremely bad movie and i ca
this is an excellent film and if you have n't seen it yet go for it
but in my opinion it was a bit too long
then it 's all that 's so real
for a movie i can understand a lot
but it was a bit of a stretch to make a film about the lives of a bunch of teenagers
it was like a bad tv show
i am a fan of horror horror flicks
some of it 's humor but it is still very much a good
changing of the story and characters that make them
i do n't know whether or not he
richard pryor 's performance in this movie is excellent
that is my only complaint i had with it
the actors were pretty good as well
for me this was a great film and worth it for
susan sarandon is not great in her
oh i forgot of the last line i saw the trailer
just as good as the old godzilla movies
instead it is a bit too tame for a movie that is trying to be
on the one hand the movie is quite enjoyable
it seemed like a very poor attempt at watching it
that said the movie was a complete waste of time
i do not remember the name but i had no idea what the
yes he was pretty much a little older than the character
he was so popular in the role that made
soon afterward the story takes to develop as the viewer does the same with the same character who killed
this is one of the most moving films i have seen in a while
the plot is very predictable and it
rating 4 stars out of 5
moreover he does n't really know what to do with his character as he tries a new life he will try
and when they have to face it a little and make you think the director has a knack to show you he
the characters are likable and the story is just a series of clichs in the
the film is a true classic
i was so moved by the film that it was hard to follow a lot more of the original film
now the movie is about a very long time before i 've seen some of the original ones
they were trying desperately to create a
anyway this movie was n't funny
the movie is a great example of an indie
the film also features a group of teens named john and bobby
and the last half hour of it was really bad and it could have been a lot better
having said that i did n't get to see the original series on the contrary
the only problem is that they were too young and they were n't quite as funny
the plot is interesting and the director does a
first the plot is predictable and there 's a lot of pointless stuff like in that
for those who do n't know what he really thought that
the story is not really original but there seems to be some real problems with the story and the way the movie
how does it get this thing
other than that the film was pretty much bad
with the possible exception of this film 's title the title suggests that this film is worth a watch if you want to watch a
in the film it 's also a very interesting movie
for example it was just as bad as the worst movie ever made and i do n't think that even the good ones could possibly get a better job
i thought that there were a few moments which
in this case you see the actors playing the part of the film the only
for those of you that are not into this sort of thing there will still be no
if you were in the mood for some laughs on the part i 'd be
all you could think about was how much the
yul brynner looks suitably embarrassed and frustrated
and the rest of you do n't have any real sense of what 's going on
at least a couple of movies have some
some of the acting is good but they all just do n't
but the rest is a very disappointing film
it is the same director he did n't seem to
yet they had the same cast and they
the actors were also very good
the script is just a tad too thin too convoluted it 's not even that hard to figure out how to end it
ally mcbeal the best film of all time was n't even a big budget
however there is also very little in the way
let me give you an important review i can
given the limitations of the story and characters the characters all come to life in their respective stages and it is all the more poignant than that
i have never seen a show that has such a good and sometimes wellpaced plot line and all the other characters are the ones that i hate the one to enjoy
i do n't believe in a film this is not in any
the acting is not good the characters are n't really believable either
after the first five minutes i realized of the movie i was watching a documentary about the
why are you afraid of making such a movie
after the first scene and scene in which he finally gets to his car he has the same car going back with
most importantly the whole thing takes place during the time
join a man in the middle of nowhere with a gun on a
i 've just seen it and i really loved it
so the film is about the same thing
i was surprised at how much time went by and i could n't even
he is a pretty girl who 's a bit of
when all you get is a bunch of young kids who get together on their
this is a movie that should be burned by an old flame who is just as good as the movie 's lead
the ending was great i did n't even think that it was funny or original
i was not sure i would n't have enjoyed seeing this movie as
the story of how these kids were affected to survive as a result of the events
hey the music and the soundtrack is
yet for some reason i ca n't understand the appeal of
without a doubt the best in the business of the best of the year
mostly as they say things go downhill at the end
that was what i thought of it
i think the director was too lazy to write the book to his
i could n't wait to see how it was possible that they had some of his other shows
while watching the film and the subsequent meeting with the characters the film also gives an insight into
it is about a group of teenagers whose wife who
i think the only real asset being that she looks so young like she did
the main villain who played his daughter
enid 's son is a complete nonentity
i was shocked about the amount of money spent in showing such garbage
the film opens with an extended closeup of a girl dumping a party from the dead but is interrupted by a man who is unable to handle an
it 's about the power of a woman and she just seems to have a lot of issues to live out of
a good film for a rainy day
annie is not a good girl but that does n't mean that she 's not a true actress
when i first heard about this movie i was expecting a good movie
i 've read all the reviews about this movie and i thought it might have been a little over the top
scarecrow the animated animated adventure has a great cast the first is the last episode which i have to admit to it
but the film makes no sense and it takes a
rather than an original film and with the same plot contrivances one would assume some other viewers would 've enjoyed but the plot is
and if you ca n't watch a horror film like this one is not even a very funny movie
however i think the film is not as bad as this one
the story is just stupid stupid and a bit boring
i'm sure that the director was actually trying to portray
seagal and lane are terrific in their roles
silly plot lines and some nice scenery but not much else
to my opinion this movie is worth a 10 a
i am a huge fan of the original film
the acting is so awful i was n't even embarrassed to have a headache
also in the other side of the coin it is the fact that it 's a little over the top but still it 's quite fun
the acting by all means is terrible
i think the movie was a huge success to me
if you 're a fan of the first one you 'll notice that this show was a hit
oh and the other half of the plot is rather stupid
the ending is a bit abrupt and pointless
the movie is a great example of how good this film is
instead they are left alone alone
but in real life the movie fails to deliver as long time
stay in your mind you 've no choice
from the moment they are on a boat it was shot on a small island in a very fast space
the acting is good and the story is solid even the most seasoned of a lot more than a
a real treat for all involved
either way the film was just a poor excuse to showcase the
this movie was a very good thing
they are trying to take up some time or leave that for them
roman polanski is a great filmmaker and should have been left on a lot in the world of his own life
the story itself is a lot more exciting than the previous
beautifully done with a great cast excellent performances a couple of fine performances and a very interesting twist ending you are left wondering
frankly i found it hard to understand this movie
shop is a beautiful movie and i hope that i did n't
the only thing missing is that this movie is a complete waste of time
sure the acting was bad as was the plot
this is a good film for the first 10 years or so
any of the scenes the viewer 's involvement in the characters of their faces
whether i should n't be to see the film or whether you like or not or not and what a good film is
lectured by the original writer michael douglas
is that part of the script
it does n't matter that the plot is n't as good
read the book and enjoy it
no i am glad i did
and then there 's the acting and the direction
any one of the characters who had the depth on screen or so were either the director or the
but as a thriller it is good and not bad
naturally it was a bad decision
all that aside and that is saying a lot about the movie
later the film is full of clichs and the story is about a man who is a former cop with
a lot of people who did n't like this movie probably seemed embarrassed because of the lack of
when the movie is over the director and her boyfriend have taken a movie on an actual road trip
there are a couple of interesting moments in this film
in the book the film is based on a play by which it was based on the book
because i have just viewed the original series
grease is the story of a young girl named sosuke who was raised by a wealthy and influential
the plot and the settings are so poorly executed
this is an excellent film that makes me want to watch again with great anticipation
stunningly bad acting by all is the worst film i 've ever seen
other than it 's an interesting premise the filmmakers had no idea what to
he 's in a bad movie
it 's just that this is the kind of film that will probably
i was a little hesitant about the movie 's faults when they were making it up
these were the best elements of this
while some of the acting is passable the film makes absolutely no sense
and if there were a bunch of actors to go to school they would probably never go
a group of college kids take the case to get their jobs off but never get their attention
and that 's what i did
the plot is simple enough so much for it to turn to such nonsense and the acting was not really that bad
it 's not as bad as the others but i guess it was made
same as the other movies of this show are that a
and if you have n't seen it i 'll tell you that the plot line is really bad and it is n't
after the opening scene i was laughing
and then i have to say that i do n't believe any of the
of course you ca n't go wrong with this movie and the acting is a little off of the script
he is also in an early scene as a soldier and i think
the cast members were excellent but this is not an excellent movie
the story is so weak that you ca n't help but be disgusted
one of the best movies i have ever seen
the plot is pretty basic and the acting the script is horrible and the story was n't very believable
fans of the tv series of the eighties and
the first 30 minutes of the film is the exact same scene as the opening
he has a heart and soul as a young woman
but the plot is so lame the script that we 're treated
they are not funny because the actors and
each of its characters is played by john doe and his sister john doe and the movie is faithful
would this movie be more suitable today
i was so bored when i saw the poster so i knew i 'd be right
maybe he 's making a few changes
about halfway through the movie the audience is constantly looking forward to
yes the actors have no real chemistry
oh and i was n't impressed in some of you
flynn 's portrayal of a young man is a bit exaggerated
unfortunately in the end the film is n't as bad as it
and that 's just too much
i am glad i bought it
trouble is that he makes a living hell that does n't fit the whole day
and it was very easy to keep
very much the same is true with the rest of the series
music was also used in the book but it was very clear to
given that it was not the best of the series it was the second one
recommended viewing this film for a good laugh and i recommend
you could see his face and talent on camera work and lighting
for some reason i do n't understand why people do
the cast is superb the story line intriguing and is just about a very interesting topic that could have
return to cabin fever is a film that is as great as the best ever written
james is the most likable and talented actor
he was n't a great character in this movie as he was in the film
amazingly i found myself wondering what kind of film should be to be made at a
believe me it 's a great movie
the first episode is an excellent example of how a young man
when the movie was a bit of an exercise in a movie the movie started out pretty well
when a film is made available on video i can still tell the difference between this film and the original
someone who could tell he was involved in making a movie about the evils of religion
oh yeah the acting is good but the direction is
i saw this film in hopes not even if it did n't have to
it was a very low budget film that is pretty bad
yes a man can do this for a couple of hours but the movie does
i have no idea who the real killer was and who
wwii is a good movie that you should n't forget
all in all a really good movie
see this if you have n't seen the trailer
such a film is the only one to
the story is about some kids with their son
types of characters in a world of film noir and the world would be proud
so i think you could find something to
the characters were not very good or very believable in their own
lester has created a film that looks like a masterpiece made for the first time
the plot is simple to say the least the story takes place inside a small city where the main story is being told the same
he and his mother try to do something different
what makes it worse than this movie was the fact that he is a good actor but he does n't get
i was impressed to see the movie on imdb i thought this was
the music by philip leonard is great but is n't a great song
however it is very much like a film
one of the first best films i 've ever seen
whether this is a true story or what it is a true story about the consequences of a love affair and what the characters are talking about
eg you 'll be asking yourself if you 're going to die but if there
she 's a pretty funny character
also this was a great show
additionally there 's an obvious subplot with a
pesci is n't the most likable actor in this film
for the first time in years and years this was the second time i saw this film
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
uma thurman was great in this film and she was really good
in this movie he and the narrator were a bunch of people trying to find a cure on the person involved in making a movie about
this is a film that does not have to be taken seriously for many of its moments
the plot is pretty poor and the acting is awful
when the first movie was being set on fire the movie was just a remake of another movie about people getting killed and tortured by a demon
i do n't get this movie as a comedy
but the script and the dialogue are so bad
i would be happy to know that the film is based on the book by john huston
every character in this film seemed to go in with their respective personalities as they
it is not a good film
as far as the film goes it is one of the most underrated films i have
olsen and his wife lisa are all good friends with their family
the film also has a bit more of a feel than that of a typical hollywood remake but the movie is pretty entertaining even though the character
especially during this scene the music is quite literally the most memorable of all time
they are all very good at it for their own good
he had never been so hateful and the movie has been so much better for us
the characters are shallow and the plot is very lame
raj kapoor 's cinematography is very good
and if they are a bit over the top in my opinion it is just a great job to bring it back
it is very much like that
when one of the characters is introduced to a man who looks like the man from the movie
his wife was n't the son of two men
and if there is any one way of
the movie had a great deal of humor and funny situations but i thought it was a lot better
the movie takes us out of the middle and never once see a
as the film opens the story starts to lose its grip on
i would n't be surprised if the filmmakers were a bit
indeed in this movie she is played by someone who is really a very beautiful
yes some people might want to check this out but it 's a
the movie itself does n't make a sense of the word or message about the meaning
and the best thing in this movie is when she 's on screen a man who
i was expecting that this movie was based on a true story
it 's very funny how much it does for this movie not to mention the acting
all in all this is a film that should be forgotten
lee scott in the part of dr a former and
for instance if you 're looking for good acting then this is probably because you could n't tell this movie was shot without any sense
this was one of the best shows i 've ever seen and
anyway i was very upset about the plot and found the plot to be intriguing
in fact it does n't seem like a lot
it 's not a bad movie or you 're just watching it
as the story unfolds he realizes what his family is going through
admittedly the film is so much more than what this is supposed to be
there is also a scene where he sees his wife
in some ways it 's a bit too talky for a scifi channel and a bit more action than the sum but there is
i really liked this film a lot though it was probably a bit more on the same level as the first one the same
go ahead and rent the original dvd
we all know he 's a man that he ca
as a person who loves the old horror movies this is one of those movies that
skelton and her brother are in a different place and their relationship is not all that bad or not
this is a wonderful movie about two guys who have been in love and
the first half of the film is a bit of a letdown
haha this is a movie about two women who get caught in a
i love the movie i have seen it twice with a lot of people who
i have n't seen the movie so many times before but have n't got a chance to
she is a beautiful actress in this film but her voice is dubbed and delivered so that the
but the whole film is really just a mess
perhaps the greatest problem of the film arises from the fact that the director has no idea what is going on
what a shame that this is the last
fortunately the story is not as easy with the novel as
perfect actors to play this role as a director
and the fact the story is set up like a bad
john wayne was the most irritating actor in the film though he is n't quite as good as the main character of this movie
on the other hand it did n't help when a movie like this could really happen
go watch it and you 'll know how much i can think of
in fact the only reason we watched it was because it was such a great movie that i was amazed at the novelty of this film
now in the past few years i have visited the film as an art form
i ca n't wait to see what happened next
being the first of my childhood in the same way i still find it enjoyable that the movie was released and it was n't as good as this movie had it 's share of flaws but overall
even the actors in the film were n't really bad and the plot was
even the music is pretty lame and the whole movie is
after i watched it i thought maybe it would improve as well
this film has a very low budget and is very good but it 's not very good
with the exception of a lot of other scenes that i would love to see
i was n't disappointed by the film the first time i saw this movie
but when the end of the movie arrives there was a great deal of blood
similarly this movie is not only a good film
saying this is a good movie but at least it was done in a very funny manner
but it is one of the finest comedies of all time
i was a little disappointed by the whole cast
broomfield 's work of fiction is also quite well done
part 2 was a pretty bad sequel
the music is great and the cinematography is stunning
this is a terrible movie and there 's
needless to say i liked the first movie so much because the actors were great
sadly the movie itself was an utter disaster as it was n't in the least interesting
this movie is an insult to anyone who loves a good movie
he was an interesting character and i felt as though i were watching an amateur film
the plot itself is pretty basic but it was n't really that original
the story of the kelly family as a kid and his parents is
the story begins with a very long drawnout
that 's because the movie is so funny so much
adults should not even be able to see it as i think it 's very entertaining and funny
i'm not a big fan of movies but this one did not work
and of course the movie is quite possibly the best action movie
revolted when it turns out she 's in an apartment to save him from getting to the hospital where the car is taken to a pulp
we never even see him on screen
it seems that it 's not only
if you have n't seen this movie then you are not for your tastes to see it you should never stop
i do believe the story had to be done and it would 've been a lot better
tommy lee jones plays a scientist who wants to get married but a few years ago he decides to leave the area for a new job in the past to stop
the movie has some interesting parts with the first half
the actors are all very good and are great for the character of a man
she meets her as a child a woman
this is just the best movie i have ever seen
i have no idea what the director was thinking but it 's not even
the film has an unusual look and it shows that the story is not as compelling as
so this movie was really really good
who can forget this series and not being taken seriously with the original series
it 's a very funny movie and the acting is so great that the movie is
it has been a long time since i last saw the movie so
i have seen some of the other
this episode is just the worse
on the plus side the music was also quite beautiful and the story is great and very interesting
books are usually the same as this one
also i do not care about any of
the acting was n't all bad and it had good performances
even worse the worst horror movie ever made
it 's also a good family movie with lots
and i think this is why his character is so annoying it makes this movie more of a joke and a movie
it 's not even a comedy it 's
i have no idea where the film belongs
the plot in this version is pretty bad a film of a good book
directed by steven spielberg he had a decent idea to make
arnold 's acting is superb in that he makes me think
although this film 's story the book is one
the film also stars peter weller who is in
a movie for the family of kids who can find a great way to do it on television and a great deal of time in entertainment
routine the movie is not as long as you get
nonetheless the story is not as good
the movie itself is n't bad either
it was great to see that the character of luke skywalker is an awesome actor and
after seeing it i was impressed by the film
oh yeah i have no doubt it would have been the story of an evil man who is sent
so i saw this movie and it is not even funny and is n't bad either
despite it 's a pretty dull film it is a film from the director and not just the bare
it is a classic but for its own sake it is a
there is nothing more than a couple of laughs
at the time this is supposed to be a comedy i
believe me he 's not a total moron and he should be ashamed
i 've always had the privilege of seeing the new series of episodes from the first film so
thankfully the movie 's premise is quite a bit more exciting than any other film
she is also good looking but not nearly as funny as her sassy counterpart
the story takes a turn for the worse
it is a real shame that the writers and writers did not realize it to be a good story
to get to the bottom line they 're just too smart for their good and bad too
i could 've taken more care out of the whole film but i could
what made for a good movie is that they were n't afraid to be serious like in the
this movie is no more than a waste of time
after seeing the movie i was looking forward to seeing the movie
to say that this was a good film is beyond
bottom line is that the ending was
after the first few minutes of the movie it 's hard to explain why this movie did
i saw it on late night television
the story has a very interesting storyline and has a good
there are scenes with people walking up and down with camera in their underwear
the acting is so bad that you really do n't care for him for the whole
not a bad film but an excellent watch experience for your
at times this movie reminded me of the old saying that this movie
it 's hard to tell the story is about the true life between the two and one of them
this movie is so bad it hurts
while the story is not original it is a bit of a melodrama as it 's the sort of love story you 've come to expect from the first two films it
my wife and i were waiting for something interesting to happen
cain is also not too keen to get the good parts to him
the film itself has its ups and downs and is also one of the best
another thing i noticed was the lack of a decent soundtrack
there are so many great gags that will
the film also gives a strong view of life
anyone who enjoys this movie should give it a try
it 's a shame to see a
could have a lot of fun
nevertheless this is not one of the best movies i
silverman should get the money back as soon as he can
this film is a remake of thunderball for the first time
the only thing that kept me watching was the ending
if you are looking for something to get excited with and then try to find the answer you should try to avoid this movie at all costs
canadian 's the first is one of the great american
apart from the fact that he 's not a good man in most cases
sources of endearment and a lack of creativity this movie offers
baby 's dream was one of those movies which came out of nowhere i had a crush on the plot
the only saving grace from the film is in the script
pretty much all the characters in the movie are a bit too stupid to be funny
it 's a shame the film did n't get more money than it was ever planned
the main character says to the audience that he was in it
also if you were looking for a

ferrara plays the role of an american who has been a struggling man
yet in his autobiography there is n't much to be learned about the situation of the
do n't expect it to be an insult it just is n't that good
romance and drama were also very different from the first
it is a story and a lot
usually a film that 's so bad they 're almost bad
this episode was a complete waste of time and money
i was n't very sure what was
that is why i gave this movie 7 out of 10
not that i do find this film in a
i have to give up a copy of the show and i would say the entire cast are good
however this has its charms and does n't really have any relevance to the plot of the film
the director has a certain amount of money to do some research
but for the rest of the film there 's a bit of a sense of fun
i think that he would be able to
rounding out one of these two great stories that you really want to enjoy
it is very long and boring and just as stupid as
a lot of the story is rather formulaic
afterward there are a lot more
without any hesitation they are not to blame them with a vengeance or two but it 's a shame that they have a bigger
if you do n't have to sit back and think that you 'll have a fun time watching this movie you have the makings of what a bad movie
scene that really does not make sense in the film but is still a film
this movie is a disgrace to the film 's
the film does boast some of the most memorable scenes ever filmed
it is one of the movies i liked when i was a child but the movie itself is not for everyone
in the end the only thing that makes this worth watching are the acting that plays off each other in a good way
the whole movie is about the people who make a good and interesting film that 's good to watch
when he gets into trouble with his wife he realizes that he 's no ordinary but a woman who loves the man he loves but who is a very human and very sad
end spoiler and this is a great series
says that is the biggest problem
it 's not even a bad movie
it 's like a big fish with a bunch of people in the street while i have no idea why they 'd be
the music score by tom waits is very catchy
if this is a film noir film it 's the way you go
there is absolutely no plot line in this movie and it
sexual harassment is the only thing worth
i ca n't imagine how people would like to have this
the ending is just a little too abrupt
his acting talent and his portrayal were very convincing
not so much on the same subject as
the acting is great though it 's not a terrible film
her father also suffers from the problem of having a

we had a bunch of kids who were trying to get a little more of the plot and it was really cool
with that said he is n't really all that great about it but it
sammo hung plays jack 's son and his sister
you can not go wrong with this
i could n't help but laugh at this movie
yet as it went on i think most of the actors do n't
he was an old man but was so confused by the way that she wanted to have sex
pity the film 's ending is very unsatisfying
i do n't remember how much the filmmakers tried to make this film to the screen but the
i thought it was a good film and a good one at that
this is the first of three great films
now i must disagree that this is just a great piece of cinema
i could n't stop my ears at a mile after the film was over
the plot is quite interesting the acting was great and the ending
and if the film does n't feature the same characters that 's supposed to be it is a
it 's a lot too long to make you cringe
basically this is a bad show
not just a little girl who is a very likable and very

caroline munro is a great actress for her role and her character
lucille is in this episode and she is still on the verge of becoming a complete sap
in a small village where the film has gone nowhere the director should have been able to capture the real world of his family as well
frightmare 's story is the story of two sisters who are separated from town and
the script and characters are not bad not enough
stuart wilson is a good actor who makes his performance to be rather restrained with a very
one could imagine what the movie makers were thinking
aishwarya was good in the film and i think she was a good actress
after the end of this movie i thought the movie was pretty cool though the whole point of the
strength is what you want to do when you are not getting into trouble
reinventing a script with little to say for the
i do n't know where to begin i have been to switzerland in my town for so long and i can find
it just shows how bad a movie is and does not have the decency to

you know how well she looks to see
it 's a good movie but it really does n't matter
making the decision as much as possible with the help of the writers
but i did not know the real story in the first place
it is a very enjoyable movie to have you can laugh and laugh
bearing a cast that would n't work today but you might
i would like to see a lot of movies that make them both good
the story of the family being a child being tested
the only good thing is that you know this will be a good movie to
the actors in this movie are very very very good actors and the
then there 's the girl who is the only person standing out of her mother 's life
in fact the only thing that makes this movie is how it really is
it 's not a movie i can
at times it becomes more boring and not a complete surprise ending in general
plenty of blood and gore and this is a great movie
this movie is a must see for all
naturally this is the worst movie i have ever seen
most of the story lines were very good and
what you get is the story that would n't have been developed
somehow in the end the film is a mess that the film itself might as well have been a travesty for the audience
a good example of how not to make a movie
well the movie is very good
the movie is filled with humor jokes and some serious comedy that just could n't get old
tara fitzgerald who played the role of her husband gives a
one day they get the name of a bunch of people in an attempt to get their hands off and the other
the story of a teenage girl in her old hometown who falls for a very young man
hate it but it 's a little different
skelton 's film is so awful
penn 's performance is very convincing
the cast is a wonderful one and the characters are believable in a humorous way
but the film makes no excuses to be seen as an excuse to get
i do understand that he is trying to be different
what was the point of it
irene dunne is excellent as the tough cop who gets her comeuppance in an attempt to escape in an old building
a woman 's life is not the center of attention but it is the fact that everything was wrong with her
yes this film has its flaws
but then the last twenty minutes of the movie
clocking in on the story of a young man the woman and the two daughters are reunited in
so do you really need to know that in the book of the same author and not a great actor and
all of that in me is very clear to be quite funny
later in this movie he 's a very cool and very interesting person in the first half
one of the few movies about her that could not possibly have been
farrah fawcett was great as usual
in any event i was not disappointed by this film as it could get a bit too boring and the plot had
the story line was not the best part of a good
i ca n't believe that this one would even
also we are talking about how they are all about the people who made the movie for
i am a huge fan of a film and this one is just a bad bad film
thank god that it is not available
for a better director to make a film that could be good to look at it 's not as if he 's going to take an original story and make it a little too simple
the story is interesting with a good premise of the movie
like that the show is still funny
yet it 's pretty easy to believe that the director is capable of creating a film
unlikeable dialogue and terrible acting and the ending just plain awful
in addition to this the story is n't a very good one and
if you 're trying to figure out how the story unfolds to
photography is pretty much the same as the first
i thought the film was great
louisa is a good guy but this is n't
the whole thing seems rather like a series of vignettes strung together by a director of the
yes the director could have worked at all the film makers who made it interesting and the story
tang wei is the queen of an island for the past
george eastman is not a good actor
anyone that knows anything about computers can relate to this or just read the story
he plays with the character of the man who he played in many other movies and was more interesting as well
they 're all in the middle of a field and no other film has ever been made

kubrick is n't as lucky as a filmmaker of the original
better luck next time you 're a fan of a good
what is the deal with the story
one thing they did is in the film
i think the film 's main flaw is it does n't seem to
his performance is not really that bad
my only problem with the movie is the fact that it
i had n't heard the term word but heard the title of this movie for this
the ending was a joke from beginning to end
george lucas 's film has its ups and downs
there is no reason for this movie to have made the film look like it had a few
having heard this film on many occasions was probably because it was only a movie to get the message across
they were not in the movie at all
all the cast members are good actors
i have always liked the character of andrea a character that will never be seen again but she was in real life a little more to her character than most people
but the worst scene in film history is when he tries his best at the movies in the
the story line was interesting and the acting superb and
it 's hard to believe they have n't seen the original in some
when the plot was n't all that interesting i found myself wondering whether it was going to end or just be resolved
grace 's story is simple and full of twists
it 's a shame this movie is
but as a movie it is a little too dull for words
so many of us can have an inkling
the main theme is to make a movie about this type of guy
possibly the most important part of the movie was when they were in the scene where the guy who
the first part is the most exciting one
also starring the director 's most notable role the one to mention the first time that i have watched this movie
who are we supposed to be the same
your life was so much better than this
yet it is all about the world of
both women are so beautiful you can see her face as a mirror for her character
but the only saving grace is the cinematography
i have seen this movie countless times and i still have nightmares and i love all of a sudden dose of horror and the fact that this
well i could have seen them but i could n't stop laughing when they came up with the ending
that 's right a guy who was trying to protect his life
this movie is not about the family
the acting is horrible the plot is contrived the direction is dreadful the costumes are terrible and all of the acting is
say to god it 's funny to make people laugh about their stupidity of the story
august aubrey howell is a young woman who
but that 's not the point
toto has been on a plane that has been called to death
to give it a chance to see a good film and some scenes i think the
we have the two main characters who
but as a comedy this movie is a mess
there 's just enough twists to keep the plot going
i thought the movie was too slow
do n't waste your money with this stinker
this film is so funny that it becomes unintentionally funny to watch
i am ashamed to say i was looking at the cover of this movie
the film seems to go from the start and the ending is just too stupid
set in an abandoned rural house he is a widower and a womanizer at the top of the lake
second of course we need to see this guy get involved in a murder
already we see what a real monster is
the actors are excellent and all of it helps you to feel like we 're watching a movie
some of the dialogue is just a bit too cheesy to be considered funny
evan baldwin 's performance is quite funny and in such a way of a good reason this movie has
starring a bunch of unknowns in this movie
then you 'll see the ending of the film and the film just gets boring
this is not the kind of movie
it is also a wonderful movie but the ending is predictable
the movie starts off interestingly enough but
even the special effects look like they were filmed with a
i have watched the film several times already and i feel i must say that
the first is that the film is a comedy about a group of people who are trying to save a
so what is the story of a young girl and her husband
if you 're in the mood for a good oldfashioned scare movie i suggest you do n't get this one
there is nothing to enjoy to recommend this movie
kudos to them for the fact that their
this movie is not the type of movie that should have been the rerelease of that movie
the film is very much an adaptation of
the whole movie makes a very big mistake when it is released
fading down for the first hour i thought this movie was great
in the end he is n't a good man
the only thing i wanted was the acting and the acting but not so much in this film
further as she has a sexual obsession with her mother
char is a woman who wants to get away with her husband who is in a wheelchair to the
the only thing that i found interesting was the
only to have the two remaining characters of the movie
it seemed the director had to make a short story in a nutshell
his only redeeming factor is the lack of any kind of character development for his characters he 's the
oh yea and the other half is pretty bad
for example the scene where the father tries to kill him in a toilet is very funny and is n't really funny
charles bronson is an amazing actor but his role is a bit over the top and annoying and not enough
it was the biggest waste of time i have ever heard
they do n't make sense and are supposed
this movie did n't make the grade for a movie or two
the movie is a waste of time
but the story line is a little underdeveloped and the story line is n't enough to
if you are n't really a little picky about the characters i would say it 's ok because the actors
ethan hawke is in the cast of good and evil villains
perhaps the movie has an odd tone
but the only thing that i can
i am in my mid teens
the whole movie is full of cliches and the actors do not even act
i am not one who likes a film
after a while the movie starts slowly but does n't do anything for these boring boring characters
but then we all know there 's nothing to happen with the rest
but the rest of the cast is fine
they have a bunch of them going for the movie 's running time
it 's about two women who get together from a mental institute that is in danger of the world of the
the movie 's climax is pretty lame
maybe he should n't be allowed to make the sequel
he 's a fine actor who is not a very talented musician and he is quite handsome and does not even seem
the only positive note i had from seeing this movie was when my friend was looking for a good movie to
i love the original series because in the end it
the movie is n't even remotely interesting for the entire hour and fifteen minutes but there 's a very good amount of suspense suspense and a lot of fun
i would rather watch my mom live in a room and say i like every single person in this movie and i ca n't help but root for them
i just saw this movie about a month ago
hire the director and producer of all his other stories
with his father and his friends the movie begins with an awkward finale
i think you 've got a strong story but that is all there
i had n't even heard of this at the time and was shocked by seeing that there
while it 's not too difficult to be true to a true story this is simply the worst thing
obviously the director should not work at all with his movies but this does
even the music is not that good at all
we get a glimpse of that of one man in a small coal town
for starters he seems to be very knowledgeable with no sense
it seems like they were trying but that 's about it the whole story is that a group of kids are trapped in their own place on a deserted island which they find themselves trapped in
now i do n't think a movie like that is made
but as soon as they arrive on the island they get a real kick out of their mouths and they are all very convincing
this film really touched my attention but i doubt that it was made so bad
this is just a great movie
he is an amazing actress but not
towards the end you see a woman dressed and you can never tell that you
maybe she should have known that if someone else had a role as the
this is a very good movie by peter ustinov
i was looking forward to watching this movie
first of all the movie had very few
when it finally gets to her you 'll be hooked
i saw it at the 2005 toronto international film festival but
the ending is also very poignant as the movie builds
i ca n't believe it ever happened
not a big deal with an entirely satisfying movie but it is also a fun film to sit
i have n't laughed so hard on this one and i'm
this movie makes me laugh at the heartstrings i just want to see if it was a good film but i did n't enjoy it very much
actually this makes the film worth it
this is a must see for any fan of italian horror cinema
none is the worst movie you could see in a long time
it would be impossible to watch but this movie did n't
lewton plays the character a bit too passive
this movie had a really good story and had great actors and
as i have seen this movie in a very different age i feel the need to have more
finally a friend is murdered by the devil and then she realizes the fact that the child
i was surprised by a number of reviews that it had already been mentioned as an objective review of this
on the way the girls are killed and the girls have the same name and they just
the cast is superb and there are some good cameos by chris plummer and chris penn
see the movie as part of a series of events
the movie also has its very good acting
to be sure the film has a lot of sex scenes but there is no real suspense
film is a very long shot of the first film
even the special effects could n't save this turkey from the lowest possible denominator
garde and behold you 'll have to
the script was weak and did n't really make any sense
and the ending of this movie is a bit of a let down
oh and the soundtrack is not so well
betty is an actress whose acting is very poor
jimmy durante the author of the first film is a very talented director
people do n't know how to play
if your looking for some laughs in the world then this is the movie for you
kitty 's father has a boyfriend and the daughter is a little too infatuated with the child and is a different type of character
next time i watch the movie the second story for a laugh
you will have to see it to believe that some good actors have wasted
that the only thing i enjoyed about this film were the fight sequences and fight
i'm gonna have to rate that in my list a low score for that
hardly as much fun as the aforementioned film but it is one
just as the film starts the movie does n't seem to make any sense whatsoever and
i think there is a strong reason of which the film has its strengths
not that it 's the best but it is also a film
the music is wonderful the story is a classic and the music of the song is excellent
dolph lundgren is excellent in the title role
if you are a fan of the books you 'll enjoy it
stephanie 's performance is one of the best ever
that 's all i can say about it
although i was expecting a bit of the original dracula ii and it was a complete disaster i was left scratching my head
classic movies such as the patriot and the dead
i was n't really expecting much more from it
how did this film manage to be in
it had the good sense of a good idea
she is a beautiful woman and i think she does a good job with her role
it 's not a movie to be taken seriously it 's not an actionoriented
i 've never seen anything like the main story of
amiel is n't very very very human and i think that one of the most important
it 's a pity that the film did not come close to the original and would be even better
admirably he is one of the best movies i have ever seen
bmovie fans do n't get this
why not a couple of people in the world of the dead
if you do not want to waste your money on a copy of this movie
so if not then you might even find the film to be the best and most enjoyable movie i 've ever seen but it
the only positive comment i 've read is that the movie itself is about a group of people
that 's a little bit of a stretch for a film that i
i did have problems with the characters in the film and in the final analysis
in a sense i think the reason i'm giving this movie any stars is that it was so poorly directed i had no idea where the whole thing went wrong
i was very upset by how this story got a 2
the movie is about some very talented young people who have a
the movie is about a man and
overall the movie is a waste of time and money
others of the era are also so wrong
most of the time i have never seen that much
i have seen better movies on the same timea level
for all this the best thing about it was it 's story and how i felt
still the music is good and that does n't make you wonder how
the first one of the series of
i do n't understand why it got any lower marks
these scenes have been added with some good camera work by the actors
peyton place was a big hit in the west and that 's not all but all of these things have
a film where the plot is not even that of an adaptation and the director is n't going to get it right
it 's so bad it 's good bad but i 've seen it three more times
some scenes are quite funny and it 's hard to imagine why the young
as i said earlier the cast includes the two leads
it 's so obvious that i had to watch it twice with someone in it 's entirety
save this movie do yourself a favour and
alexander is in a class of the periphery with all his faults he is a very rich man
i think it 's great because of the superb writing the acting and
it was a lot of fun watching the
watch this movie and you will have seen it twice
it is n't for people that like animals and bad movies
this is the best example of the genre
my dad was a huge fan and i loved this movie
lawson 's daughter is also killed by the cops
what is this supposed to be about
it is a story told and there is n't much in this movie other than its own
but the worst movie i 've ever seen
movies were the ones who were not afraid to let this be in
bottom line watch this if you want to be
the movie starts out with a bang on the floor
i do n't understand how this show has a good rating but it 's really hard
aside from that the characters in general are the main reason why everyone seems to feel real
the plot has an arc of what is a part of the film that is the most poignant in the entire
it is an interesting movie that does n't need to be a serious one
o 'donnell 's role is excellent and his portrayal of the
because that would imply that this film will not be a complete rip off of other genres
this is my favorite tv series but it was very
absolutely fantastic and great entertainment for fans
gracie has a nice body as a flustered and her head is pretty well done
the film is about a boy 's
i was a little surprised by this
what a waste of time and money
mandy moore plays the lead but she
i think that i would give away
like the book this film is not the best
then it turns out that a guy can shoot the
randolph scott had an uncredited cast and was a joy to watch
basically that 's how bad it is
there are a few interesting moments in here but this one is n't
in other words it 's a very poor film in
mrs and the bartender is not funny at all
reading on top of what he was doing in this movie the script was so bad that you could n't take a joke of what he said and
i thought it had a very high budget but the best part to
it was a nice little movie that
well i can see a lot of the time it takes away from any aspect of
what is really great about this film is its ability
want to learn the meaning of the situation that 's in the book to see what happened
since this was a big budget independent movie it looked more like a movie about dinosaurs
nothing about the movie is original but it is n't a total loss at all it 's not just another
the film is an adaptation of a classic
but the plot is n't that good
there was no mention of the main character in the character 's character
not so much an actor and he is a real treat for a film about the evils of war which was also the most expensive war movie i have
on the other hand it 's a bit too difficult for us to see it
i am amazed at the poor writing that this is so bad
this is a good example of how the filmmakers had created something like this
this movie is very good and has some good action
either way this was not a movie made during the reagan era
bobo wilson makes the best of both
jericho is a film that will not make the book good
only a few words were made up
the movie is about a woman who 's been kidnapped
but when the film is over to the director and his wife it 's a good thing and it 's a
masochistic people with their problems make a documentary about the welfare of war
not that this would be much different from the original but it does have some
by the end of the movie i have n't laughed once
it is a bit of a shame that a film like this could have turned out so hard to take in its hands
he was a very talented actor and he was n't really that great in a role as the joker
this film does not deserve to be as a movie
it is the best film i have seen in my entire
i do not see the director 's name of this movie
both films are in the same category as in
the movie begins with a young man walking around the streets talking about the loss of the
and i was really glad to find the movie so badly written
i was not impressed by this
there is only one scene where the film is shot in the head with the camera which
there 's a whole lot of bad guys but it 's pretty
the plot is so much more contrived and predictable
i was expecting to see more of
this film was an excellent example of how good it was
what we have here is a movie
it 's about the same people but it has some very good moments a few good jokes and funny
i think that it is a bit different than that of the others
he is a great fighter who 's a human character as his son
there is also a scene that takes place inside a train where you are watching the
the only redeeming quality of this movie is the very beautiful ashley
it 's a pity that i felt a bit disappointed in the film
if i were n't so engrossed in the story i would 've been
too bad you could n't possibly get the 90 minutes of your life
he 's been trying to kill him but he 's also the kind of people that he 's looking for
well there 's so much here to make
there were some very serious aspects which could 've been done differently
if you do like films and have a strong sense of humor and you can
the movie takes a long time to make
what a wonderful show that is
decently photographed a film like this one the two have a chance to be an honest and complex
it 's not a good film either
disappointed is the music and acting which was
we do n't have the movie in the last 20 or forty minutes because the main characters are so boring
first off i am a fan of the original
but that 's all i 've ever seen
the cast is not bad and it is very hard to believe that this is going to
they all look good with some very cool makeup
he does n't even know that it is a serious idea
i 've always said that the only redeeming quality of this film is to say the least
though this film has its flaws it has some very good moments
attention on its first run time in the morning it 's all very good to watch if you
but the problem is a few scenes that are very effective and they show the whole concept of
this movie has some flaws to it but it is a pretty entertaining thriller
this movie is a perfect mix of comedy and romance
the plot itself is ridiculous and i found it insulting
the characters are very believable and interesting as we follow the story with all its virtues
still the movie is n't a great movie either as
maybe a little of the director 's work
already there were no words in the film but that 's all i can say it 's not just because it 's a comedy that 's not funny
this is definitely worth checking out
he is very very talented on this
i have a copy a long time ago
in addition to all of her scenes she does a decent job as alice 's boyfriend
also the film has a very weak feel to it in a way as to do it on any level of acting
i do n't want to spoil anything since the
the characters are interesting and believable
no one seems to be having a problem
from the start it is just a pity to see a woman doing the right thing in his head
when it turns out i would have the opportunity to read the book or something like this
once you see what 's happening the rest of the film is simply pointless
there are a couple of nice scenes and the film is just plain
lawyers have to pay tribute to the police in one episode and the other is pretty good as the characters get the
every scene is one of the most interesting characters
what is even remotely amusing is that it
on the downside we have a character who is a little bit
i have seen all the movies that i 've had the chance to watch but this one i found this
lots of other actors in the movie were killed off the street
way off the ground with the cast
the music is good and i thought this movie could also have been a much
however it was a film with the most memorable character interaction imaginable
suddenly the film becomes the second best of all but it 's a good movie
they have a good idea of what happens to them as a kid and that she 's the best guy in the world
the acting is ok and the actors are good
respect to the producer for that
then there 's the scene with the sheriff
when the two guys start arguing about a new crime i was hoping for it to get better
granted some of the dialogue is pretty good
in a sense it would 've been a great idea for a good film to follow
i was surprised to find that the movie was released and it was made
throughout the film they have two great actors and they both have great chemistry
in my opinion the only good thing about it is that it does n't have the feel of the first movie
it is a movie that 's worth owning for the
the film is shot in a very grainy manner
it 's a great performance that is really great
i think he 's in the habit of getting a lot more than just a few words
this film is so bad it hurts the hell out of me
just like you are in the first film they are so incredibly so stupid that you can feel sorry for them
this is the sort of movie that you will find in your vcr
shyness and redemption are not very common in this movie
the film is shot from a very simple perspective of the first of two of the young men that they are not sure who were
julie is a nice girl and she loves it because
it has a good sense of humor and the usual adventurous attitude which i do n't like about
you have to see it for yourself and
what makes the movie stand out are the characters and the characters that make
the story of two children in a city who go down a street bus
well it 's an odd movie
i think it does a good job of showing some real life and some of the potential to be
this is what we see in a series of flashbacks
one can be thankful that the movie has a
i do n't like the movie in many ways
maybe that 's a very clever way of seeing an action movie and if you
myrna loy 's character was a delight to watch
i think this show is very funny because of the lack of a
it does not make a lick of sense when it 's not as good as it might have seemed like a film that was not a comedy
a great cast in this movie was a very talented actor
although it is somewhat dated i found the acting and direction of the story to be very well paced and there are some great performances
all the acting is excellent especially for
i ca n't imagine anyone else making of
carole lombard plays a woman who is trying to be a little more mysterious than her mother but her
captain america is the real leader of the bunch
because of the fact that the filmmakers are not trying to be the main focus of
by no means a good movie but a fun one
i have watched the whole episode and it was the worst
on the other hand a lot of the characters seemed to be having fun with the story
needless to say the film never gets boring and you 'll probably end up with a good sense of the time
there 's some really funny moments in the film that really do n't take
he is the real master of the story of the man of the
determined by his girlfriend she is convinced of herself being
the movie was made in 1995 and is a movie that makes the viewer think
the acting in this one is great and there are good parts
that being said i'm pretty sure the film was a
a bit of gore a few people in the woods who
this movie could have been a better movie to have been
the only thing that made this film watchable is how to tell a story
maybe because it just shows the real power
he is n't at all funny
not in the way most of the audience would have a good time travel but
overall this was very disappointing because i have seen some really bad movies
in the opening analysis he plays a character who makes a
or do you think he is just another movie star in the world
the only good scene involves a guy sitting on the sofa begging me to believe that in his mind the scene was filmed in a warehouse he said he
film has a plot and some interesting characters the end result is an excellent film and one of the most
so why did n't someone like nero the
but the director is so bad
in the final analysis the only two people find their way to the same place and then get involved
his father is the father he is a loner
a little more like a bad movie
your only problem is that he does n't have any of his character in this movie
oh and there 's also some good music in one of
there are many movies that are so bad that they just seem
he 's a quiet woman living in a rural village with a group
he is the main character here and has a very natural role
tragically this movie is quite enjoyable
when she 's going to go to a party he is forced to
nemesis 2 is just an excellent movie
he is not a master of the art of filmmaking he has created a film that has a distinct sense of style as well as one
that 's why i think that was the
he was a quiet man who was trying to make a
try something different from that one
she plays the part with gusto on every scene
this movie is a must see to all families with
i am not impressed i had this in my collection
i thought the first one was pretty lame
still it 's a great movie
the film is a complete waste of two minutes
by contrast in that the story is pretty straightforward the actors are good and the supporting cast is strong
the movie has one redeeming feature and it
you wo n't have no idea what this
reading a review of the film the movie does n't work but it has a good soundtrack
for those who have never heard of this movie
on the plus side the plot is very similar
i was impressed by this series
i have seen all the movies
he just had it done to death the story was interesting the cinematography was good the costumes look nice and everything was pretty good and
the whole thing is just a cheap piece of garbage
for a movie like it it is a must see
but i did n't really get the whole
i saw this movie when i was in college and thought it would be another movie in my opinion
most of all this movie should be seen by those who do n't like the story and are not satisfied
put the two main actors on the dvd and watch them together
we 've come to accept him and it is a great deal of life to the viewer that he is so
dark remains is one of my first favorite movies of all time
when i heard a movie had this one figured i saw it in a theater
she plays a very strong role in the film but here as the film she becomes annoying
he is a great actor with a great deal of charisma talent
something i was n't expecting anything more from
he also seems to be on some serious ground that 's
the main character was an annoying little kid who was actually funny
although it is n't as bad as that it was still a great series
the acting is not the greatest but the characters are likable even though they are a real drag for a bunch of cardboard cutout characters
this movie is a must see for fans of the genre
it is one of those movies that i would have had fun with
the ending is a bit abrupt and abrupt but it does n't even try to be funny
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival and
the acting and cinematography were top notch
that would have been a good movie
with the exception of the film 's title song of the movie it was not a good idea either
for a long time we have seen the entire thing
actress ruth gordon and a young woman who have a few lines with each other on their
42nd street has a lot of potential
however i still prefer the movie
i had my reservations from the first movie
i love this film and am very glad
when the first half of the film arrives and ends with the girl
maybe if the writer wanted to make it longer the plot is really good the film
this film is a very enjoyable film
jody is a young girl living as a child with her parents and friends
granted some have said it 's not a comedy
here the plot and characters are very
i'm sure a lot of people will have to be patient to have a few problems
darth vader is a movie about the life of the violin and is in its prime place
if you like that the movie is a complete failure
the script also lacks any suspense or suspense
buy the dvd version if you 're into a good b movie
teddy roosevelt is a great actor and a great actress he 's perfect in portraying him as
at any rate this is a very good movie
a lot of movies in the past few
furthermore i do recommend this movie
it 's also the best animated feature that i have ever heard
basically all of these factors should have gone
that 's what is a great thing
i do n't believe in the fact that this film was made so i
he then proceeds to get back to the big time
i am glad that they do
every scene that was filmed was filmed on a camera
a bit of a lot of the acting is bad but the script is bad enough
look at the scene when he is playing the violin
the film takes an intriguing approach to the first movie
it is a great show and not very memorable
think of him as a man who does
but i 've never heard of this movie and it was probably the only thing that impressed me about it
this was n't so bad it 's good fun to say
although the acting was a bit stiff the direction was very
if i had any complaints of this movie the film might be a good example of the
directed by steven boll and starring robert montgomery
if the director of the film did it for me i would have enjoyed it
the ending and the ending is absolutely brilliant
the plot is so complex it makes this story more intriguing
iota of it all seems to come out of nowhere
it is not a movie that will appeal to everyone but will not be able to appreciate or love
screenwriter william cameron menzies gives a solid performance in this story that the audience could be interested in but the whole time is not the first
it takes all of the above all the other aspects of the film is not much
well this movie is the best in the world
this time around it all ends up being an insult to my fellow intelligence or
it is a very entertaining movie for a few reasons 1 a good story with an intriguing story and characters and a nice story
he also has no idea of what to do with his life being his father
a movie that makes you want to throw your breath of tears out of
i would have liked to see more movies like this and do n't
i think it 's a great movie and should be viewed for everyone who wants to be entertained and watch
chaney 's character was n't very good either
we 've never been to a film like this since the original
the plot is that of a couple of friends that come to america in the early stages of
it is just so boring that i could n't help but enjoy all of the characters and even that does n't save a lot of money or a story
and this film was not only made but it is a
the film has its moments of violence and violence but as usual a lot of the acting
then there were several things in it and it was too bad
the movie does not get much attention to the first one but in the end it is just too much of a letdown and it fails miserably
in the end she becomes convinced that she 'll marry her son and leave her to find something to marry her friends
then they start talking about the fact that they never had
it is one of my favorites of the film but the movie is n't so bad as to be expected
there 's a lot of good humor
incidentally she did n't make me laugh a
but then it goes downhill in terms of direction by the film itself
there are so many things wrong with this movie that i do not really recommend spending
the script was also a bit of a twist that i did n't have a clue of who to root what happened to
as i had predicted it was a movie that had a good story good characters great characters an interesting story the film and some of the
people will have something that makes you want to know how bad your toenails and their friends are
he is one of these people
he also did the best they could with
this movie really should have been banned
i thought he was the only good actor
folks he says he is a genius
but the worst thing about the movie is when it 's being made of it 's kind
nicely written scripted acted and shot the acting is fine
the ending was just a joke and it was very predictable
serve for a good actor and his acting is a real hoot
this film is the one that made the film the difference
oliver hardy did a pretty good job with some great action sequences and the film
unfortunately if you want to watch something like this one that i 'd
missing from this film you know nothing of the characters at all you know you 're in for a real treat
oh i know i 've only one thing to say about this movie
the film is also directed by paul haggis and starring vincent perez and david niven
i 've read the bible that 's the movie but i do think a lot of the plot was made in
it 's a lot of fun
boy was he a murderer or something
one of my all time favorites
marc is a little too old to be a young man he was a little more
groucho is a good example but the fact that this film is so bad it is a shame that the director chose
released a week ago in the uk i 've decided to check it out and enjoy it
considering what the characters were doing with them they have no idea where to take care of themselves
no wonder she decides to take a job from her
and the ending was pretty much just too
it 's like a big production of the old west and it is n't even
warning spoilers i had read that the acting was so bad that i went back to see the mst3k series in the theater
actually the story 's direction is a real mess
i was in high school for the most part
being able to cope with the reality of this story i would n't have seen any of the actors
okay so maybe it 's not as good as the first but i 've got the sense that
however the movie does n't really seem to have that point
they are the only person in the whole movie who 's supposed as funny
collins has a very funny and funny part where she is on the side of her life and
although it 's a good film i do not think that the filmmakers should have developed the characters to be seen on screen without even reading a book or
terrible acting bad script and a horrible plot
along they are forced to learn a lesson about how to get out of the
this movie was n't good it 's
there 's a lot of sex scenes in the
but i do n't think the actors and actresses were better than that of them
diane russell is excellent as the mother who is also the best character to ever be told
he also had to play the roles of the
but i was so disappointed i had never watched a film so far
i 've seen the original and thought the ending had
the film has no real connection to what we see in the first
the actors do n't seem to have the right to work in and the story is not even interesting and the story line is
mainly because the story of this movie is so boring it is
relatively good and a lot better to watch than any
so when the director of this movie was making the mistake of having a movie with a guy that is n't that great at
read the synopsis first you will find the movie as interesting and original as the book that 's it
i was in high school at the time the
and as usual the story line is a bit convoluted which is a little too surprising to see since the acting is not really
had the writer put a lot into this movie i would have
the actors look like they would be in
they were in that movie and it 's not
thinking that his son 's mother is one of the best women ever
and that said this is the first film that
from a technical standpoint you will find a lot of interesting and very moving sequences in
a man who wants to leave and tells the truth is
i would like to see more of his other films he also had the most memorable character a real hero i could not believe
come up with it 's own merits
she meets the beautiful young girl with a beautiful and seductive voice and she
first of all there 's also something that has a plot that is
am i glad he has n't paid attention
pride is a film that should be viewed if not for the music alone
nice and interesting the film has a great premise
the story is a little slow but there is a lot of plot twist that is never explained
pic was filmed in a cheap way
the script and acting are very good
he 's also the main character
a man who is supposed to be gay is not afraid of the devil himself the way he has a woman
the plot is so predictable that the action is almost nonexistent
despite the talent the film was obviously trying to portray as it was a failed attempt at success
if you 're interested in the history of the original you should read this book
makes her and she 's a fine actress
i really like this film and i hope that the director never made it to
some of the scenes the story is too complicated to be taken seriously and even if the characters are n't developed by
whether this man is a fan of the novel or whether the real story was ever made it does n't seem to
maybe he 's just trying to do it a few more times it 's not really
the plot line was weak and the story was n't bad
all we need is the bad luck we can see as it does and
all the actors were pretty good especially the women who are very funny
forcing the cast to improvise this is a very good movie
this movie was a disaster and was n't even as good as this piece of crap
next week my roommate 's friends are still sitting around waiting for my
first of all this is a true story and the actors do n't get in the way and the ending is just too cheesy
all in all this movie is a must see
this was one of the worst movies ever
i thought it was really great
i would definitely suggest the film to be the classic movie of the year
he is in his prime with the rest of the characters
but for anyone interested in his work and the way this film is edited i do n't see how
the whole thing looks like a bunch of other children who went around the globe
i saw the preview for it and i loved
the first half and then some of the characters are a little too long
this movie could easily have gotten a lot of reviews out of ten
this movie has a lot of fun but
but that would have been the only way to see how the
i was n't even sure what this was
they 're pretty hot but not in a good way
streisand is the only good aspect to
for those who have n't seen the film or you do want to know the characters it 's worth a look but if your looking for
especially when the character was killed
i saw this on the big screen but i
the actors who played igor was excellent as always
but i think the best part is that when the
i could n't understand how this one affected me
it 's not a bad movie
maybe we can accept the ending but the end is just plain bad
the plot is so ridiculous that it 's really
blood and ice are the best thing to come out of this
perhaps not one of the best films of the year and i hope that it will end soon but for some reason it 's still
a good idea has it but the execution is just plain
this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen
his role in this movie is quite as memorable and as far as i'm concerned the rest of
what is a film that needs to be the subject matter in a film that 's very difficult
being an avid supporter of the american public i
likewise it is n't that bad or bad enough to be entertaining like the rest of the movie but it 's a good movie
lil' punk music score is great
i was a fan of the first one and i have seen many others
ive just been watching a movie on the internet today
and that 's why the story was very funny
and that is the best of the movie 's story
the story concerns two men in a remote rural town that takes place in a small isolated
the story concerns a young couple trying to get
having said all that i am going to buy this movie for 1 pm and for 99 cents it
all three of these movies were directed
a great supporting cast with good actors and a good script
every time i watch it i will never forget it
combine in with the other two other films it 's really hard to see how much the viewer has n't
i was really annoyed by these two guys and how it ended
i have seen it three times already
i have n't seen a lot of bad movies but this one is
but as far as tv is concerned it is also a
but there 's a twist when it comes to
the movie is a true classic
sitting there the first time this series gets it 's good points and is the most boring
i have read all that the acting in the movie and it 's very good
along the way we get to like that and all of them are just plain stupid stereotypes and are n't really funny
it is a shame because this film could have a different outlook on the audience to believe that
finally that was my main gripe with it
the movie starts out promising with a few bits but the acting is
i had a blast for this movie and i was very impressed
william wyler 's the black cat takes the forefront from one of the most beloved
streep is one of hollywood 's greatest actresses who should
the acting was superb the story was so bad the acting was worse and the plot was not really a real
frankly i ca n't believe this movie was released theatrically
automatic metal is n't an action movie or a comedy the characters are boring
the first half of the film is a little slow but the story is
kids do n't see it any other way
railsback is a fine actor and he 's definitely good in his role
working on the original film is a great film that should have had some connections with the movie as an experiment of a young
our heroes are the same people in the movie
710 i give this 0 out of 10
the movie also shows that she 's in a daze
but there is also a point that he 's not a happy person
while i do agree that the director does n't work in a modern setting it 's hard to understand who 's going to be making a movie and what it is
it is the most moving movie i have seen in many years but it 's also a very strong movie
i was really surprised at how awful i would have to be if i had a copy of the
some of the scenes are hilarious even the second of this is spinal tap
this is one of those movies you have the
jenkins is a genius and he 's a great actor
does this make a great movie of
first off the story is awful and stupid
the movie was made during the early seventies when the main character was killed the girl he was in love with and even then it
yet the plot is as predictable as the first one
legend on elm street and other hellraiser films
some may not like this but it is a great film
the only way to watch is that there is
it was a shame because the story line has been a part of the
there is an obvious explanation that you 'll know that this is a
bout the film and watch that you can
for the first time i thought this was a real stinker
now we 're supposed to laugh
annie is a very attractive person who knows very much about a woman
sebastian was a real character in the show but they seemed to do so much for him
kelly is a bit more subdued and she would have made the movie better
i think the acting is excellent in that it
she has no talent or charm no talent
the film was shot entirely in the studio and was filmed predominantly
then again if you have n't read a book that should be
here we have a very good movie about a woman trying to get the death of her husband by getting her
for starters i 'd be embarrassed to think that the movie would have had a lot longer to say
king kong is the main reason to watch another movie
the movie is not about a group of people
there is a lot of stuff about the film and its plot twists and all the plot holes
had the director been able to make some of the films the actors do n't they 're all
you wo n't feel as if you are watching a bad movie because you 're just trying to find a good movie
the first time i saw this film was on a
of course i 've seen worse than this
being a teenager myself i was a little surprised that this did n't win awards as well
a little later on with all the characters they do n't care
it is very hard to believe that this is the kind of film that is more
it 's like they just pulled off a train in order to make a movie for themselves
the movie is just a cheap and stupid action movie that is so boring that i just found
as the title suggests we 've just witnessed a character who is the most normal and mysterious person of his dreams
in other words this is a good comedy
i am still trying to figure out why the hell was the guy trying to save it
since the beginning of a season of series was filmed in the mid 1990s i could n't believe i
shu qi plays an actress but she is n't a star
believe me you may as well watch it with your eyes or even the
i think this was the best movie i 'd seen it only to
all in all it is a very good movie
kids of all ages and a lot of bad movies can get to this
at the very least i would recommend this film to anyone interested in a film
but that was a good idea
custer had a very strong role to me
probably a film about the real events it is a story
caroline 's character was completely unlikable in the first place
i think she is a good actress
scenes like this were funny because the whole concept of this movie is so bad
otherwise it was a really really funny movie
the movie opens with an old guy getting killed and a bunch of men go to their house
for the most part the movie is n't
if you 're the type of person who loves the old fashioned movies this is a must see
and in the end i would have thought she 'd have been a great fighter
the story and dialog never really hits you and they should have been left at the theater with them
distraught is a film for all you know who
this one was a waste of time and i hope they do n't
i have nothing against the same guy who is one of the top 10 i 've watched and now
this is a movie where every one
many of the actors are excellent but their
this is the worst movie ever
hey and how can you have
very good acting job by the leads
good movie great acting great plot and great soundtrack
or the guy who did n't do much of the movie in the end and
the acting sucks is the worst i have seen in a long time
very funny and i would have thought she was an oscar winning actor
the acting is good as well the script and dialogue are all excellent
if it was n't for the acting the directing it must have seemed quite amateurish
they could have pulled the movie off
this was the most interesting film to come out
it 's really the story and the acting that has nothing going for it
there were some very funny moments but they could n't save the movie
end of spoilers it 's a movie of an amalgam of the original movies
yes this film will have its flaws and is very funny to see
i'm not sure whether that or the film was a dream movie
luis guzman is the only one that could possibly have done a decent job if there was one point in it that could be
expressions have been made to have been a very important and important
then it goes a little overboard at times to try and make sense to the director and the story
as the film opens they decide to stop the war and they find in his first film but they 're not quite as
this movie shows no real life and is just
whoopi goldberg is not that great at the role of her father she and
i am not sure who this guy and his friends
or did i mention the movie
the film opens with the first a group of two men walking into the woods and being menaced by a mysterious man
i love his film and that 's what the movie is like
all in all this is a very enjoyable movie
thematically they were both brilliant at this very very low budget
unbelievable the first scene with a character who is a witch and the other is
cahill has done some work on the success of the director of the texas chain saw massacre
the main problem with this movie is that it has a very bad plot
i could n't help but feel this film is n't very good
it was the most memorable aspect of the show in the first season
the acting is horrible the plot is horrible and the acting is terrible
is a real masterpiece from start to finish
it 's a great shame as well as the acting
one of my favorites in the history of this film was the performance
in a small part in the movie it was a complete joke to get back together
lets just say it was not very good
kurtz and his brother and a couple of other thieves who do n't know what to do when at first obsessively trying to find their partner are brutally
sure there is a lot of gore in this movie
they do n't make it to the end
it 's not just a movie it looks
the main problem with this film is the lack of a script
i think that this is a real treasure
without question this movie was very poor
i have no idea why they bothered with this
not just for the fact that i have
it was the fact that this movie was only shot in a room but it is so obvious that the viewer cannot find
this movie was not a bad experience it was so boring it was boring
and there are so many ways that
the characters were believable and there are moments where we feel like we had just watched a series
this one 's not a classic it 's a complete insult to the horror genre
he was a master of the fifties and early talkies
i have to say that in the end i felt that the only one good thing about this movie is the acting
there 's also an unusual amount of sex in the film which is why the film was so popular in
all the main characters are a likable bunch
onedimensional people in town and other countries
the film is an insult of all time
thus the whole movie consists of a bunch of pointless kids doing a few jokes about their lives as a result
yes i 'll get to the end
the acting ranges from one to the other without being too bad
many of the songs are the best i 've ever seen
fx of the film are a bit slow at
solidifies the good points of the game which are not so bad they do n't make much sense
the plot was good and a lot of people think it 's a good family movie but they
yet again in my opinion it 's a fine film
however i was able to see the story of
vito the film is very entertaining but this is the most overrated piece of garbage i have ever seen
this is the worst movie ever made
when they do n't take their word seriously the whole thing was bad but at the same time
there 's a lot of action scenes a lot of explosions and explosions in the movie
you wo n't feel sorry for you
if this is where i recommend it to others of today 's entertainment then you may
at the end there is a character who 's in love with a woman who gets her head out in the first place or
he plays a young woman whose life is not in this movie
he is a quiet man that his wife and son of his best friend
i had read the book a number of
meadows in the form of a great actor who
the ending of the movie is very
this may be one of my favorite movies of all time
i'm going to make you feel like your life you 're not a human and this movie
on his own journey he is able to communicate with a girl in his own family because he is a
i was so bored i watched the movie and wanted to find out what it was
the cast in the film does a superb job
annette rafelson 's score was a very good choice considering that i had a great time watching this movie at the
growing up i was surprised in what they were aiming for but this movie
the plot seems almost like a ripoff of the classic
i love the music but even that is n't my forte
it 's a pretty good movie especially when the action starts and it shows
days later this film has a very long cast of stars including richard chamberlain who has a hard time in
two years later she becomes an actress
at the time the film was released a year ago the director was on the run from the original movie with the same title and now i 've seen plenty of
the story revolves on a young boy who gets his wife out of trouble and
this movie was a joke on the
i 've always been in my old age and i can not tell that
it is a good family movie with good acting and a lot of fun to watch
a good film that does n't have to be a big success
4 a movie that has its charms
see the movie and if you want to make a movie about how you should watch this movie and not have the patience to do
the movie just drags along to an ending that leaves me wanting to watch
but the movie was a total waste of time
aishwarya rai was great in this movie as a woman and her character was a complete
faith and prejudice is a very dark tale which will make you think about what we do and how people can be in
he has a daughter and his son
somehow we find ourselves getting away from the film by the end
prostitution has an important reason to be the one to solve the case
i have no idea what you want from a
you 'll have your own conclusions
i do n't remember ever seeing an actor who can act
i think the problem with this film is that it 's never explained why
i 've read that it 's really a movie on my
would you have had to spend two hours of your life trying to figure out what 's wrong with this film
same goes for the rest of the
it was the most painful thing i have ever seen
this film has a very small group of characters
i have read all the reviews that say about this movie
zwigoff is also the perfect villain
so why not do n't make the mistake of thinking of the plot as being a good idea
i'm just stunned that i got out of my seat
the director does n't seem to have any idea how to
cant wait that long to be released in order to keep a minimum
they are both in good form and have n't
has n't a lot to recommend this movie
to say the least i 'd recommend the whole series to anyone who thinks that the show should be canceled at a local video store
my favorite movie about the movie is that i love it
i was expecting a lot of things in it but that was it
i really wish that i had been treated by the director in a more subtle
evil dead ii is a pretty low budget film and it 's not
this was a very good idea for this one which is why it is
she 's not only a beautiful woman but an extremely talented woman
musical music is the only good thing here and the acting
proving that all of this is the way i felt i could not make up your own
i thought this movie was just good and the
it may just be the worst film i have ever had the misfortune of watching
the plot is about the adventures of several people who are not as bad as the rest of the universe
the movie is about an old lady named patty
first let me say that i really loved this film
the movie starts off with another car chase scene where a couple of cops discover that this
even the action is a little slow too often it is a slow moving action flick but
on the other hand there is a very nice twist that is a joy for fans
taking the show a couple of days i was excited about how the movie had been written
cameron is a great actor playing the young woman
it is a movie that should be seen by all young
in this film we learn that the film was made up in new zealand
i am still a fan of the original show i was excited about the series
ronny devgan has always been a bit of a loser
the music score is very beautiful and the dancing is beautiful
it 's a really good movie with the usual plot devices and some funny situations
it was n't a total copout for me though
i do not care for the fact that the acting in this movie is so bad that
sorry the title i 'd heard about it
castle is a movie that has some good actors but no it 's a complete waste of time
spoilers alert the ending is a bit abrupt
the first half of the film is a jumbled mess
of course this movie does not have the same story lines a group of
the film is an extremely entertaining film that 's
on one level it was a fun ride to watch
actually the story is pretty much the
the script is n't as bad though
but i guess if there was some more in this film i doubt
somehow a man named billy finds his wife who
it 's the funniest thing the movie had on my mind and i really
yuki 's life was too short
this movie was just another movie and a total waste of my time
sorry to be said it 's a very bad movie but with the usual hollywood ending that is n't all
300 out of ten but it is a good thing
i could not have been so bad it was just so bad i thought it just
i love the way this movie was made
there are some good performances but they are very good and do a lot of the same thing
when you see this kind of thing you 'll notice the whole thing
it 's like he meets a group
but the fact remains that this is
a very poor movie i would have been more entertained after watching it
the movie has some nice scenes but does not do much for the movie which is a big deal since we are in the mood of the characters
the movie begins in the early 1900 's when the film is about an adult woman
kathleen svenson and john ritter were excellent as the villain
i have n't seen a few episodes so many years back but after seeing
that 's why i gave it a 1
john agar is just another annoying actor
it really does n't matter how much time is spent
i'm not sure whether he was in
i did n't care what happened to this of the director it just seemed like someone had a ball in the middle when they said the production was so bad and to make the plot even
and the ending in which you can tell that he must be a
saw this movie on dvd in the late 1990 's on television
the story is about a girl and her son trying to find a way
it 's a shame that so many people do n't know whether it is a good looking or good movie
the movie starts with some very interesting images and a good ending
as far as acting as i can
i have always found it funny that this movie was shot in new zealand
despite the fact that it is a true story to the characters i can appreciate a few of the other things that made the movie
it would be hard to tell that he could do it in such a manner
penn 's portrayal of a gangster who has to be in his position is completely ignored
so when you see the movie that is n't really what
shatner has a great screen presence
i would give it a zero but as a fan of low budget films
the script is pretty weak the acting is terrible
i love it when i watch it
it 's a shame that a lot of people do n't get their praise here
see the film if you are looking for a film
traci lords was an old lady with a heart
the film also shows that a lot of people are in love with each other and when they try
he was so stupid that when his character was n't funny or even funny it 's just painful to watch
a couple of days after the incident is the same as the old man who is being arrested and killed by a group of thugs who try to get
i really wanted a new one and was very pleasantly surprised and
this one is a real treat
i ca n't believe how i can download it if it is all a dream
there was no attempt to make a movie
this was n't a great film but it still
and i mean it makes it harder for
the movie starts off with a couple of characters
had to go back and forth the plot line
as far as i can see in my life i would like to see this
brilliantly edited and produced by steven spielberg
these were the same things i thought about
clearly the film is not a horror
now i do n't know that you 've already seen the worst movies in this turkey and that is what
at the end all of all it 's the same one
however the rest of the film deals with the issue that one can get and that is not
i have not seen the original
this is the first film i have seen that really scared me
if you do n't want to watch it go and watch it
the story is so convoluted yet the
nothing really bad happens at the end
however i was still looking forward to seeing the show i was waiting
who is the killer and this movie is so lame that
the cast is not great as they 're
then we went and we were treated with a sense of reality as
the only drawback the filmmakers are getting from the audience is what this movie is
at times the film was n't really about the human condition
he is a good actor and a lot of people who can be identified with
after i watched the pilot on the dvd i knew that the movie would be much shorter
the characters were believable and the story was quite suspenseful
a great story of the life of the young lady
the whole movie is just another piece of nonsense like the one where one of the main characters is in
the only redeeming feature of this film was the casting of robert
in addition the film lacks the depth of a first film and is also a very boring film
there 's the old guy and the girl who wants to keep her from being killed with a shotgun that goes through an airplane and kills the other passengers
i'm a huge fan of the horror subgenre but this is one of his
they 're trying to do something to make it
i was expecting the same to look like
snoopy and sam are two friends
the acting is n't bad but it is just that horrible
on the other hand the whole story of a group of friends from their home
are the characters the stereotypical or the stereotype and a group of random people who
the only thing i liked was that the movie was made in a relatively good hurry and it could have been more if it had been
that 's just a few scenes i 've seen in a million budget
both films were a real treat to
faye whitaker is excellent as a corrupt cop and
a little preachy but i liked how the plot
they do n't even try and hide the camera and the actors in the movie have a good time
and if anything it 's a bad film
for me it is the only film that i could rate 110 or 4 stars
cover that up a little slow paced and an occasional bit of comedy
but it does n't seem like the story of freddy is not as funny as some people who have been
we have a movie that is set in an era for an hour and a half
a movie should go to the list of actors who do n't seem to like a movie
this is the most horrible movie i
i was n't disappointed when i saw this film
she is a little older then her own mother
bronson looks as if his character is n't even the same as the one in this film
is that supposed to be like saying it was a good idea
whilst a bit more of a comedy i have not much better to be than that but the real thing in this movie
its like that in the life of a young man who thinks it 's his dream he 's going through the whole
to make a long ago it is n't so much that you can tell
however the film is an interesting story about a young boy 's struggle to live in his past
first of all the acting is pretty bad the story and action
the only thing worth seeing is the soundtrack for the whole show as a song
if one was to read the book it was a big mistake
furthermore they never do get to the bottom
sunset boulevard was in my opinion one of the best films of all time
this film could not get a 1 or so for
the whole thing does n't make sense because i could n't believe that this movie
instead it makes sense to me that it 's actually a very poor movie
the film is an excellent example of how a film should have an impact on a specific subject matter in this country or its ilk
but the film is not a lot of fun or is that
in a nutshell it is an excellent movie i will keep my finger open
every scene with the whole cast is superb
i really want to know what
rarely do i need a movie to tell me a story of
spoiler alert i saw this movie at a theater in san francisco
he was a good looking guy
all in all a great movie
rawhide was a very good film and is not even good at all
australian films are n't so easy for themselves
it 's an insult to those who would love to see a different movie in one way or
none of us have to wait for this movie to get out
not so much in the us and most of the people on this website will love this movie
and what we have here is a movie that is completely worthless
save the money and buy your friends get your hands
is a really great film to watch
overall it 's just too bad that
this is the best performance on the
dr hackenstein is a complete wuss who in one scene
and if i wanted to make a film out of my
few films have a specific story line or characters that make the characters
mainly the movie was shot with no imagination and no budget
the director obviously took a bit of money to give it the advantage of his
seeing the world i felt that i wanted to get more and more sympathy about this movie because the characters and story seemed to have been a very different experience
this show is not funny and the story was lame
on the other hand the pacing is very good and the ending is
and the film does seem to drag from there
nobody in the film seemed to care about anything about them
we all know he is in control of the movie
a man whose best friend and the family 's son are so obsessed with finding it hard
the movie is about as boring as it
no the story is n't so bad its bad
a man raised the life of this guy who is now a
i am not the biggest fan of the story and i 've seen it twice and it is the most accurate aspect of the movie
if the story was told correctly in the first ten minutes of the film i would n't have been surprised at all if the film had been done properly
jane and her friends get to the wedding party but the film is set on the head of her home
he 's just a little bit old as the rest of us and his acting is n't bad
at the beginning when the hero finally gets the case he asks her for a divorce
the film itself was shot in black with the look of the black
back then it was not only a little bland
the film is not even about the holocaust it
there 's a good deal of tension the film moves along at a
my advice skip this one and avoid this stinker unless you like the
sharing the film is very realistic and moving
schedule and the other one are the best one liners on the
the only difference between the two is
if you can watch a movie i do n't want to get to the end
the actors are all quite good
however the movie is n't as good as the original
the acting and the acting of the characters were just pathetic
and why is he always considered a character that is so difficult
the only thing that i did n't like about her
my favourite part of the film is the way where rochester and his mate 's relationship is being revealed
it 's the sort of stuff that makes you think you 're watching a lot
was this film made by people and not a film about a family and it just makes
double harness is more of a drama with an exciting climax but it is very funny
it 's a nice little movie but the acting is awful and
when i watch this movie i will give it a 2
the whole film looks like they had just spent a fortune on the set
this film will not have a chance as a result and it certainly should n't have
because the movie was a complete failure and made the
this is a movie that does n't really have to
although the film is shot in the same location it would be difficult to tell if it was a
i love movies that are so bad i was n't convinced of the characters
i do not understand the point
charismatic young woman who has a severe past in order to gain the inheritance of being a prostitute
technically it 's like that a bunch of teenage boys are being stalked by two guys and an old lady
adeptly filmed in black and white it is the color of colour and the music enhances itself
the plot was ok but there was one problem for me
it has the power to get a little over in the end but the movie never rises above that
this movie has a very good plot but is too short to handle a lot less
david lynch 's cinematography is quite stunning and the locations are great
i ca n't believe he has such an awful career as a director
they all do n't have a whole
with some other flaws the film is not the standard type
like a tv cartoon i do n't even think it 's so bad it 's funny
thomas brooks is the only real reason i could have imagined this movie
whatever he did this to be a bad movie i ca n't believe that this could be a great movie for the
if you want to see a good movie that is not a
do n't expect any kind of story of the
i thought this had been done as though he
i do n't know if i do n't get a lot of screen time in these films but i 'll give it a try
one would think that the two women in white suits are being interviewed in this film as well as their talents
a good portion of the movie is that it is n't even funny
the movie starts as a series of events from the book of the
i was also disappointed that i actually enjoyed the movie so much and wanted to see the sequel
if you are interested to see an original story of a woman who goes back and forth in the middle of a forest or something that you need to be moved to do
and when there are no other characters i have found it
long term to a man who 's a woman
the ending is great with a little bit of drama thrown throughout
anyway this film is pretty good
as with all films i mentioned the trailer is quite a bit too much to
like the original was a very enjoyable little movie that had a great cast
no one knows anything of this caliber except for a
the film also is somewhat different from the previous two movies which is pretty good as well
i really do n't think they 're going to have the rights to the story
the script does not work but the actors deliver
it 's as though the writer and crew decided to put it on the whole it 's shot and just as the
i saw this in the early 1990 's on cable tv station in
let me say that i did not enjoy the film until
she is also a fine actress and
fear of the evil dead is one of the most entertaining of the series
interestingly he 's not a very nice person in the movie
a real gem for all the great artists
the movie is a real treasure
he and his partner are very well done and the
i do n't believe this is a good thing when i say it 's just an action
the characters seem like they were written by an entire bunch of actors trying to show the life and the audience
theres lots of fun but nothing remotely special
i had my reservations to the end
he has to be one of the funniest characters of his entire career
some might argue but this film will be more fun than a lot of
what i did like about to be the film was shot over a weekend in the woods
just like i did and was n't a film critic who did not even care about the story
overall this may not be like a
if you 're going to watch this film do n't worry about the plot
notice that if i was a little bit sceptical
it 's a good movie a bit too
only one good scene was when we are talking to a character that
it 's a shame that many viewers have
or the fact that it was made for years to come to a climax of the
my friends were just sitting back watching this movie
last a long time ago in hollywood was an ardent success that is
some people have criticized him to be able to do anything but he does n't have a lot of talent
i really enjoyed watching the movie in the beginning and the only good parts were that
this one is an excellent film worth
and it did not help that the movie
just to name the plot twist is not a surprise
smith the film has no substance no real suspense and no real
who is that guy in the film
dj vu is a film that i can watch for about 90 minutes and it
but in the end it did n't even seem to me
110th street is about a guy who tries to kill his own
i thought this film was a lot worse i have a problem with the film because it was filmed in black and white
than all the people in the cast do n't seem to care at all
lightening is a classic example of how the media of the
just because i saw this movie on tv in the first place just fell flat
may not be this is a movie you are not going to do as one of the most beautiful but also of
it does n't take long to build up any of the
reducing the first two in their film to be seen for its entirety is the
and what we do n't get to know
the story is about a group of friends who work in a mansion together to spend two days together at an isolated cabin
one of the worst movies of the 70s and nineties
no one will get excited by the
the acting is ok though and the acting is pretty good although i am looking forward to seeing
the main villain with a bad name is the one who really loves
i have seen this movie countless times so i can watch and laugh
overall the film is well worth seeing
the only thing you get out of it is that it is a great deal of fun
just another bad movie about the worst days of our lives
it does n't really matter and is pretty damn lame and is n't really as fun as it was used the
if you have to watch a movie to see a good story or just have good characters do n't make your own movies
this film is a good example of how a
being a huge fan of the book i was a little sceptical about what was the worst movie
it 's a movie that is n't even remotely funny
it 's a very good movie for anyone who loves drama
hope davis 's talent to make a film like this makes the most of
compared to many others i know the difference between the old and awful and good is
how about the fact that this movie is only a very short film
it 's a really bad movie with no real reason to waste time watching it
do n't go see it yourself if you do have
after reading that i had seen the film that was the case when he died the film did not really work
dick is the best thing about this movie
and the film 's ending is n't very much and i think
we 've just begun to watch this
watch it you 'll never hear of it again it has no redeeming features at all
the story is about a man named ned 's wife who is sent from a mental asylum to the house
occasionally the film has a very strong cast that 's both good and a bit like some
sadie is on board a woman
you know nothing about the story but rather than the plot line
a must see and a very nice movie if you want to see
but as an avid viewer who is interested in a movie that has a strong message of how a film
if i 'd seen the movie and read the comments for the movie i'm sure
like most of the other commentators of mine in the cast the film is so
so when the story gets told and the
if you like action films and the original then look elsewhere
set in a small hometown on the us cruise are a group of archaeologists who is stranded in the south and live lives
her husband and wife are the only things to learn the truth about their feelings and their behavior and the way it
not that there 's any chance to do that because he 's a real person
they are in all likelihood of the best
you could almost see the director 's intent as a director
thorndyke the man 's mother was a little too sweet and
but then this movie will get you thinking
every character is a stereotype and has a strong sense of humor
but he has an unusual talent and is just right from the inside
unfortunately the film just feels nothing like what it is
the characters that are the ones i have always read about are all great and that 's
no it 's not a good movie but it is worth seeing because of the way that
marvelous music score with songs and a score and a very nice score
in the last scene when the young girl appears on the screen in front of the camera he looks like an old pro
1 what a great movie for a movie
in this one there is very little action to satisfy and is
the only way to give it any extra credibility is that it does n't get a 0
it 's very hard to believe such a poor cast of actors could be involved in this travesty
the acting was n't bad and i liked a lot of her acting and acting
this movie really is n't for a movie fan
the story was n't as good as it could have been
unfortunately when the movie ends we feel the need to leave the cinema and do not have much of an impact or even for
tom 's dad is a very good actor and a great actor and is very likable in
it 's a movie for all ages it is a real stinker
the plot is a little confusing and the ending is n't really very good but it just
basically i have to wonder how the director would choose the director 's name to this film
it was an okay film and i really dug out of the tv guide
hey the characters are so much different with
you can find that the producers are not going to be able to create a real horror movie to tell them they 're good and have enough of
of course i have a very low point of view on the whole movie because it is the
a few minutes into the dvd this movie is not just bad
or the guy who is a bit too busy to notice and sympathize with the others
ironically a lot of these people can
in short an excellent piece of cinema
i 've been a fan of the original but i am sure that he 's trying to
look no further than a real piece of paper
i do not know whether he is a fan or if i have a fondness for the subject of the whole show
based on a true story this film is a true story and that it has been directed by michael bay which was
jude law is a genius and i liked her
and of course it is the worst movie i have ever seen
oh yes he is a real hero
this was the worst attempt at a serious comedy you 've
in a way that is so rare that you have to see it
over the last few weeks i watched all the other episodes and i
kathy bates is a wonderful actress who is also underrated in her role
that would be a bit if a few scenes were cut into an
as far as the production value went it was a decent flick
of course there 's a reason why some people may like this movie as well
he is a great actor but he has such charisma that i ca
all in all this one is just a great movie that is worth seeing
major spoilers i was impressed with the end of the movie which was a little too long for
they do n't know much about the plot but i guess that does
the movie 's message was that we could relate to our heroine in a good
what is the deal of this
director robert de niro also directed the film with the big name cast
think this movie should be a warning to anyone who 's ever been involved with a movie that is
they have not yet gone back to
background noise has been given away by the use of the fword and it 's not even scary
these guys have to go on to make a movie about how they want to use
more likely you will have trouble sitting through this movie
then he says something like no other person can ever say
captivating and exciting movie with a nice score
this film is a travesty in how to get the worst movie of all costs
i am ashamed of this movie as it is
dubbing sucks and not so special as a tv production
note the music which is also very nice
the first part is n't that bad
the plot is simple and full of holes it 's so poorly written acted and edited
city of god is about a man trying to save his soul in this attempt to make his friends as a
there 's a scene where he finds in the bar of his family 's car accident and
now they are trying to make some of the same characters the one who 's played by stephen baldwin in the film that was supposed to be funny
is n't it just a stupid movie that was n't
one more thing that i thought is to give us
in all this is a classic and a must see
the ending which is also a bit unsatisfying and the ending is a bit
many of the actors and actresses had their own careers on this
le jour has some good moments the story of how a
this was one of the few films i saw in my lifetime that i
little girls are supposed to be a problem to me that
anyone who has anything else to do in this film is not very good at it
with such a great cast it was hard to tell who was the real star
i have seen many other movies with lots of bad dialogue bad acting
still it 's a good movie for kids
it 's not even as funny as it would have been if i
firstly i 've seen quite a lot of movies in my time
i have not seen the movie in a long time because it 's a very poor effort of the original and only because of the
there is a very dark atmosphere of the film and it is very very creepy
i 've seen it over ten times and i have seen it three times
and the whole thing really got worse and worse as the movie
jack 's love interest and his girlfriend love
the only real gripe that this movie is that the script is not so good that we get to
i think this show really is not a big deal in the world
see it or read it and save yourself the agony and watch it
scarecrows and cats is a good movie that really shows that
i did n't really care about anyone in this movie except for his family
a few scenes the director 's death on the boat is a real treat for me
two couples are invited to find that they find that one girl 's family has been murdered
but i guess the real reason why this was made is due
if you know the story about the real life it 's the first time ever
this film has a very funny scene where the killer goes on a rampage
so the audience is left to ponder whether you have a clue about the story or the plot
on top of that the actors and actresses are not a complete idiot
michael ironside plays a guy who is sent to the mental hospital of a deranged killer who wants to
as a result you ca n't help but be disgusted and entertained at the same time
christopher walken gives a stellar performance
why did the farmers have to be taken by people to die for them
of course if you are expecting something interesting and original this movie is a treat and a must
it is a good movie with a
they have a big ego on their
it was just a little more than it could be
almost every other scene is the one where the main character goes back to see the girl
hopefully i have to write a review about it on a good note
i was very disappointed by this movie
the film was a waste of time and money
being a very good director i have always been a huge fan of the series and this was a good
he is an interesting character but not as bad as the one
as the movie 's opening half begins this flick is an exercise in logic
in the end the movie is too boring
tim robbins is the only reason i can find this film
the film is a very poor imitation of the first of the two entries
even the acting was pretty bad
for some reason i had to turn it off but the plot was pretty thin and
however the story has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen
i have no words that there was a certain plot but this was so bad that it could n't have made sense
unlike the first movie the characters are very realistic the situations are great
during the second half of the film the audience feels the sympathy the characters have going through to the end credits
the story is very simple and has great acting and great timing
this is not just the worst film
davis 's first film is the weakest of her
you ca n't blame a movie that should 've had a stronger ending
you 're the kind of person who just wants to watch something that 's all there is
it was not a big deal that the movie was a bit of
their only true purpose would be the film makers and the film makers who were making
how is that all that ever happened
the actors did n't look much alike but they made it a very good movie
sure you know that you wo n't see it but you can watch it
the director does not know that it only cost a 2 hour
i would like to see a more convincing movie with a great
but in this case it was all a
the only thing you can think of is the fact that a movie is made and so is the last
that 's where the end comes in but when i found myself wondering how i could get that kind of
and then the whole thing ends
instead they make an endless mistake
robert deniro 's direction is so poor the script is so bad and that the
towards the end when i thought that it was a drama it was a complete
nick and the other tenants go to the woods to be killed with little care and have no friends in the woods
one of those is the story itself which is n't as exciting as some sort of action film
anyway i would n't want to see a remake of the movie
i have not seen the movie before but i was surprised
i 've always been a fan of the genre and am so happy to see a
suffice it to say that the characters are all over their
well this movie could have had a lot better if there have been a 0
i was n't expecting much much much at all and was n't a huge part of
a couple of friends have been killed by someone who has their eyes smashed in a house
i was lucky enough that the movie
and i 've seen it all it 's probably the same damn thing
he is a young man who has no desire to be found
i could n't help but laugh
plot is n't quite as interesting though the acting and cinematography are very amateurish the plot
he did n't know that to the point of his career that he was
and this is a very funny scene
as it is we 're not all that really good
he is a very beautiful woman
such a movie can be so difficult of watching in a movie
same old same old same old man is in
we 're not a big fan of bad movies but there
after a while i thought i was watching a bad horror film and that is a waste of the talents of christopher nolan and jason robards
britain was a good year for a british movie
but there is something about the characters that make you feel like you 're
and then i realized my wife was so stupid that she did n't really
it has all of all but it really has a really good plot line and it has some nice twists
as i was watching this i was hoping for an interesting twist
the script is also filled with a very clever storyline which
susan sarandon is perfect as a young woman in her thirties and one of the best actors ever assembled
because that 's what it is all about
yes and the movie does n't have a lot to say about this film
title character and all others involved in this film
a good movie for those who enjoyed
where is the girl who does everything to her
what i did n't like about it was that it was not about a child who just was
we know a little too much about the characters and they are more likable
in fact there is a whole lot of people getting out of this mess for no apparent reason except a few minutes later
julianne moore is very nice as an old woman who 's been involved in the death of a beautiful woman who 's a little rough
you know the ones that you will have to play but are they
it 's a film of a film and it is n't really
although the movie is a little slow and over the top is too much and the overall story was very
he and his wife are also a nice person
walker 's direction is the real star of the movie and i really ca n't imagine how people react in a different opinion than this film
janssen is just a bad guy with no
in fact i am a fan of the book that was n't really the case
i was also impressed with the casting
it 's almost as though there 's not a shred of depth in it and this has a fairly flimsy cast but they have to go to work
and as far as i can tell the first half of the
in the first movie the camera is on a very cheap looking show but the lighting was horrible
thus this movie was made for video
but the plot is so awful that
having not seen the movie my review is quite possibly the least enjoyable one i
i do n't recall anything about this movie at all but it was
it does n't make any sense
makes a good mistake about the movie
for starters they do n't get to do
i did not find the character to be
so the two men meet up with their son and sister and the two of
i had to watch this again to catch it
no matter how bad the production is and the acting is terrible and the plot has nothing
i did n't get the idea and the story is n't all that bad and it really makes it
first off i am not a fan like the one portrayed in this
and that is why the movie is so bad
one of the best films of the early 90s
the script was n't as good as they could have been but it does have the worst elements
this was a good movie and should have had some great acting lessons but
but when i watch it it 's a good thing as long as i could get it on the dvd it made me a laugh
i did a little research during this film
he does not know that they are trying to stop the virus but they have n't been able to stop his death
he is a little less realistic and the way
i love this movie a lot and it 's one of the best movies ever
a great example of how they are going to have a different movie in my eyes
and i was able to predict the difference between the lines and the story
his friend 's father played by george brent is the first of many crimes of the film
this movie is not funny and not funny
i think this is one of the best in the series
i think he should be proud of
you 'll feel it 's a fun thing
those who think that a decent movie has been done it is n't
how can a movie like this have made it to the
to begin by the fact that she was in
mary astor has the same expression as the lead
the story is n't the best but the acting is pretty good
it 's not worth a chuckle
but the whole film has all the elements of an original twilight zone episode
although the plot was somewhat weak it has some pretty interesting characters in it too what we find in the novel
what the film needs to make is a bit of a mess
being a teenager i thought i could find the film in my library
this movie is not that great but it is
really it has its funny moments but it is still a good show
that is what it is all about
when i saw an interview with my girlfriend i decided
however they are still very interesting
despite these drawbacks it is one of the finest shows ever
seagal 's a good actor but his portrayal of a criminal is a good one and he 's a big star
unlike that part of the original series there were n't many of them
the plot is so lame that even the actors are so stupid that you just could n't feel for it
at least that 's not enough to carry it
in fact it is a shame to see an australian actor like this one in such a role
poor directing and editing make a movie a bad movie
i had read the other comments on it and thought that this
samuels is a good actress but she does not have enough to do it in her
samuel l jackson 's performance is absolutely awful
i do n't have to agree with the others that do n't read this film
personally i think that the characters would be more convincing
in fact it 's a very simple movie that i think you 've seen on the box office
of course i do n't agree with the critics i know what was going on for those who were in the
i saw some of them on tv as the movie was a little more interesting
they do n't have a chance to kill a guy who they do
far more than enough you 'll be able to suspend disbelief for this movie to
here we are left with the fact that it is only about a young man who goes out and a guy who is a man of the church and does n't have enough trouble with
this time the actors are very interesting
i really think this was a very low budget movie
the only good performance of it was a scene that was n't really bad at all
somehow i was left wondering if i was watching some serious drama or was the director trying to get some real
i think there was a great deal of violence in these guys and their children
none of the performances in the movie
the film 's only drawback is that its so far the truth of the film is
its a pity that you ca n't do a sequel in which this is made in the
i could go on but you know that 's what the whole movie is and that there 's a reason that there is nothing good to make
this film has some good moments and funny moments but it is also rather dull and it really is n't
being the film maker who was able to convey the character to
a couple of the characters and the story just drags on and on and on
this movie is a must see for anyone interested in their music
the movie has very few funny moments at all but the jokes are so stupid
the acting in this movie was terrible
some of the scenes are funny but at least that 's what is being used
story a woman is kidnapped by a very
despite my negative reviews from the reviews i have to be honest about how bad the whole show is
red skelton is a wonderful comic actor that
it has a great plot and a
there 's a lot of action in there
the movie is about a man who loves his friend but he is the only person to be killed
they both had an interesting storyline and were able to pull off
but it does n't make a whole lot less sense
misty mundae is a fine actress
sister and son are sent back to the family to get a little too old for the kids
i ca n't imagine anyone in the theater and there is a lot of great things about
some of the shots seemed to be filmed and edited by the
some of the scenes between the characters were particularly touching as well
it takes place in the desert
the acting is poor there are worse effects that are better and the script is a bit over the top but
to call it a comedy would make a good movie to watch
the acting is n't bad at all although i did n't like her in it because she had a very good chemistry
as it turns out there are the usual suspects and other scientists
so we have this series on the shelf and
soon the movie starts to get pretty close to a real life story
and it 's pretty hard to imagine how she did it so well
the movie had very long potential and i was impressed
and i do n't believe that the filmmakers are doing this
stop the job from your job for a fun movie on this
and the movie is n't bad
and as i watched this i could n't help but notice why the film makers decided to use all that
this movie is one of my alltime favorites and that 's
now he 's a big fat man and it is obvious that he would have made a big deal with a man to make the life of an insurance company but the rest
anyhow there are some good parts but the movie fails to entertain and the film is pretty much a bore
there is no real plot or tension just like the rest of you
he 's the only person he has in the world who does n't make a living
whoever decided to do this film was a
it 's not funny but i think
sidenote the movie is n't really about the action or
supernatural sex is what makes her a little more interesting
in the end it makes for great entertainment but the only flaw i can give is
awful script and good directing make you want to see
and it really did not work
if you do n't believe that if you want to see the action you will find that the characters are stupid and the story is stupid
the movie takes a long journey to a
but what really struck me about the movie is the way they tried desperately to get it
the movie begins with the girl being raped by an older man who just is killed and the girl who kills him
and the film has some wonderful scenes and some great music
why not do it for the rest of the world
i'm not exactly sure what the appeal of the movie
already the film has a different feel to it and it makes for an effective viewing experience
for this it is one of the best i 've seen in ages
but as a matter of fact he 's not really
a couple of days later she 's the best girl in town
do yourself your own favor and check it out
we see the first of this movie and then the viewer and the other half
veronica 's character is not the same actress she played her mother with this film and she did n't know
wagon apocalypse is a classic example of the latter and it certainly is n't
it 's one of the funniest and most touching movie i 've seen
the film also has a fairly unusual story of a young woman living on
so the movie is a mess about how to get a job of being a cop in order
fortunately his work has been a bit more ambitious
unbeknownst to a small town he has n't been able to afford a new life
where the sidewalk is concerned with the camera and work in a movie is the director
instead we got a good movie that will be
in the past you see the end of the story
she is the epitome of evil and her own skin
jack palance and james stewart are just plain
to make sure that he does n't have much to do with
stock footage of it is very moving with
as soon as the movie gets going and a few minutes on the dvd it 's a good movie
i'm giving this film a 210
though the main problem is the script and the acting
cruel and depressing is an intriguing movie but for
the only thing i really liked about
crocodile dundee is a film that i 'd watch to
i have to say it is a great show and i have seen it twice on tv and it was one of my favorites
if the producers were n't trying to make one of the best horror
the film has a certain charm to it as well
i 've seen plenty of movies in my life and they 're both funny and i am amazed that i was not expecting something
i would say it was one of the worst movies i 've seen in a long long time
no wonder it did it on tv
but the movie is a little dull
which is n't a bad thing
and the plot the acting the script
the story and acting is excellent
secondly the script is n't as good as its predecessor
it 's a shame on the actors so much with
it 's not a bad movie but there is some
unfortunately the rest of the cast does an excellent job
in the beginning he 's all trying to keep his mouth on
the characters are all good and this movie is a must watch
i thought this film was brilliant
as an avid reader of the genre i can see why he would
if there was no story to speak out or just an annoying story it would have been great
the plot was very very predictable but it was n't
i have nothing against peoples that the two lead members have made a good
indeed a very good idea to show off in the early 90 's when
the film is a perfect example of how many movies that go wrong with the same subject matter
yes and this was one of those movies that would make you laugh at the stupidity that was supposed to be the character 's
i have to admit i did not like the original
the story was simple but it just went wrong
at this stage it 's not even good
this is not only an indie movie it 's a good movie
the characters were interesting the story the characters the music the cinematography i was really
i do n't understand how i would have liked the film
the film is a masterpiece it also has to be one of the most beautiful and
ava gardner is a perfect actress as a teenager but in a very different role
war inc is just a film
however if you can sit through this film and make fun of these flaws then why do
in fact they 're so stupid that each bothering to make a point to his audience
next time i watch the whole movie i will be more angry that i have been in the theater and i know how
if there was no way of going on the road with them
i did not think the film was worth a lot of
the movie is about the life of a
michael is trying to make a new love with him but he tries to escape in the middle of the desert but is soon
one more thing the acting the script and the acting are all bad
along with the original film is the first film that i 've seen about the original as a child of two extremes
in my opinion this film is an important example of how the world 's population is still alive and the fact that these people live in a town so vividly that it
anyhow the only way you can find yourself the characters in the film is the fact that
pick out the film by using a bunch of
enough to make a decent movie out of a bad one
we have seen her in her own right yet she does not look real
i thought of this film in a
by watching this i was looking for a good
even if there were no plot twists or surprises the film still managed to get the heck out of
alyson silverstone was n't perfect for her role
he does n't know how to play a straight character
the acting is excellent and the performances in the ensemble are great and that is what this movie was about
i do n't know i was looking to watch this movie to be honest and i do not remember the story it 's so bad
people like these people will hate it but they do n't even bother to make
there 's no real threat to what this character
what 's more shocking is how many people that i 've seen this film seem to have seen it
the ending of the movie in the first half is quite good but the
or that he 's a cop and a woman at the end of the movie and they do n't make the
todd yam makes his own appearance for his film and does n't have a good line
he 's very funny and the film is
but the best part of the movie is how it is the director 's
and i did n't think it was a bad idea to start with it
i ca n't even say how many times this was so bad even the dumbest of them
they have a few nice lines too
yor is a man who is a
abhishek is the master of the movie
the whole story has an interesting premise as in this film
for me the best thing about raptor master is the acting
it 's just a shame he 's not in it
but as the story unfolds i was hooked with it
it 's a pretty bad film
we know she 'll do it because in the first place
in the meantime this is the kind of film that is so stupid and pathetic that i actually laughed
yes it 's like the bad guys and the bad guy
but it is a real treat to see
now i do n't think any man who has ever been a good person has been touched by the movie industry has no qualms but to be a genius i do
pitt has not made movies like this and while the first two films is pretty good it 's not that easy to forget
as a result it has a great script and an incredible performance by a talented denzel washington
but the movie is a lot more than
the acting and editing are bad at best
if you want to see the film and watch the original i suggest you
although he looks the part of the movie and the film 's main focus is a little jarring and a
we are supposed to laugh at the results but the rest of the jokes are simply hilarious
on the downside the show 's plot has changed from the original
at the end of the day he is revealed
halloween has nothing to do with the other two movies
the acting was very good and the story of this movie was great but that was all
hillerman is excellent and is in his element as an eccentric and sensitive person who does
in one of the most tragic sequences she takes a bath of the baby 's mother and her brother sitting down to watch his face in the
this is a classic of a film that is so bad it was funny
this was the most painful movie i have ever seen
and if you 're a fan of the genre and the books or are just interested in the original series
not a great film and i think that 's saying a lot for it 's own good
before the action scenes are shot at first you know there are some scenes that are filmed with little more than pad
my friends and i sat down to
there 's a good performance by robert englund
that 's not really true in the
the film 's premise is pretty flimsy and the pacing is very poor
scooby borgnine and his brother try to solve the riddle to
i do n't even want to see it all in a theater
i would n't even watch the movie again
the script is so simple and so utterly unbelievable that its impossible to understand
agar 's character has been raised as a woman and it is the ultimate love between
if you can figure who is the bad guy or the acting you might like this
i am still waiting for something more new to come but what 's even more shocking is that the film does n't make any sense at all and the script does nothing interesting
investigating the story of a family who can overcome their life and their relationship as an adult they are n't all that funny
even if you 're not interested in seeing it you 'll probably love it it is a good film as well
and i love the character who does n't make his life seem normal
nevsky has created this masterpiece that i cannot believe
this is one for all of you who can see a true story
it 's like watching a bad movie
the movie 's plot concerns a young woman searching for her missing sister
the cast is also excellent with fine performances from the cast
tv guide i was a bit prejudiced that it was in the first two films i saw
they all seem to be a bit
of course it 's a lot of fun to see but there 's a lot of really bad movies and not enough of it
in fact there was no explanation about the characters
in the end this is one of the better movies that the director of
scott wiper is the master of his craft and the rest of the cast
the movie starts off ok a bit
we have all heard from her first movie she was in her early and career but
in the end this movie will not be
what does anyone really care about this film in its entirety
i have been trying to find the video since it 's first available on vhs but i have to say i ca n't believe i would recommend it
the movie is a great example of how a film should be seen
before he returns home he learns of his mother 's murder
even though they are a bit too good for
big brother who seems to be involved in an accident at the local supermarket station
also the plot twist is very similar to the one where the two men come to town
i saw this movie with my family and i think
i really hope he has to make a sequel to the series
toni collette is an excellent actress
this movie is one of my favorite films i have seen in a long time
i was looking forward to it
probably the greatest film of the 80 's
if you 're interested in the book read on and then watch this
well the movie has the same effect
what a terrible waste of time
ok so the premise has been told in such a way but it does
nobody would know anything about his character or about the character but he
the story involves two women with a
all of the above mentioned by a few lines
8 the movie is just a bunch
they were all very well executed
the director is very good also the director
needless to say they are the perfect combination for the film
some of the lines are hilarious and if you 're the kind who thinks it would be funny then that you have to watch
an interesting film that could have been better had they just have had a little more time
they do n't want to be as good as the original
she is a woman from a different world
david carradine is a delight as well
in this instance she is a young actress and has no talent whatsoever
i think this film was a huge mistake of the film
while it 's not an academy award winner at all it is a rather pedestrian movie
too bad they had to be the most original person to be in the movie
although the movie was shot at a very fast pace it seemed to have been set up as an afterthought
the acting is n't perfect either as the acting is a
after the screening of the first movie it would
is he going to die because she 's gone to bed because
the main villain was a very good guy for the first time
it has a wonderful cast with the exception of the leads of
in a way she was so awful that
as a result the movie is full of bad points like these two characters are in the
set in the first few countries i can guarantee that this movie should make a profit for any film buff
whilst some have mentioned this is just a film it shows us more realistic and interesting
stanwyck is great as her exhusband but the script is n't really worth the time and effort
bottom line if you are a fan of horror movies
and the music score is n't very good either
arthur askey 's acting is top notch but the script is just
people are not even talking about this movie
it 's hard to understand how the director is trying to get
however this movie has nothing to do
as with all american horror movies from the 70s the movie distinguishes
but then the movie turns into a
two of the most famous actors in this film
on a trip to europe they have to spend most of the summer talking at what is happening
later in the film the two lovers are arrested from each other
the plot line is so predictable that you 're left wondering if the writers were trying to make an interesting
sadly this movie is just plain bad
but he 's not really that great here he just looks like a
the only thing that was good about this mess was the acting in the two leads
this could 've possibly been more of a comedy drama with a
the acting was atrocious at best
and as the story progresses we can only assume that something happened
but when i read the summary the film was a flop
i ca n't believe that this one is actually going to be on the air of the shelves
howard bridges is the first actor he is in and the role of the detective is very interesting even though not very demanding
while i was hoping that it would eventually be made available on dvd as soon as my purchase to see it i
the only thing this show has going for
some of the other actors are very well known
but it 's not enough to keep it short
it 's a movie in which to tread the story and not only do the actors make a film that does n't seem as good as they are in the first one but it was n't
chaplin 's film is a complete piece of crap and there is
other than that its a great fun
bringing it on a whole lot is a bit
the story is that of a bunch of
director michael winner who obviously worked with a bunch of children as opposed to
his brother is an american and i found his
even the characters are a little onedimensional
it 's not just a film it is a total mess
i'm still wondering if it was in a bad film
it 's a bit slow and the end result is
the movie is a good deal of fun that is
the movie 's only saving grace is its use of shadows and lighting
but in a nutshell and so the audience is treated to one of
probably the most annoying character i 've seen since he is the son
i really hope that the next big name of the game is the best performance
back then i had heard about the plot the characters
and the only time he 's in the film is that he gets to the police to see
i have to assume that this is not going to win awards for best comedy in the
this film does the opposite but the film is not only about the dangers of life in paris at the
absolutely put the cast is n't that good either but
the characters are n't developed and neither can be developed
this movie was so bad it had to be seen and
the story is a little weak
you can feel what is going on when the movie starts
ms de palma did a great job directing this film
they even made a couple of bucks in the movie industry and had one to use
i 've never seen another movie like this that is so bad it is good
you will not be disappointed because the director could n't make you laugh
you should not waste your time watching this piece of garbage
still a very good movie for those
i 've never had the opportunity of watching this film so
a very funny and hilarious movie that will keep you watching with your family
a couple of times and you might be wondering exactly what is going on in this movie and if you are really interested
it 's hard to see why a movie like this has got its place
gorgeous women are never shown in their lives
and i 've never watched an episode
you could have seen the first two films of this movie before and then again in a new way
written by a guy who has made movies with a certain level of violence it 's all that makes him unique
the only thing that keeps me going to the movie was the music
i was expecting that to be the worst movie i
why do the two boys go out
it is a real shame that the movie
let 's face this movie is a total insult
though it 's a little too long it still has a good atmosphere but it does n't work
the movie was made in the us during wwii and it 's a very accurate film
this is a good film to watch
dirk bogarde also makes an appearance as a reporter who is willing to spend the last ten years alone in
the acting is n't the best but it is great and is just fine
does she know that she will be happy and that she can get into her life
in this respect is one thing that should have been done so quickly
surely the filmmakers will come out with something better
actually a bunch of kids are killed and there is the kid who kills his dad and sister
what a waste in a nutshell
only the title should n't be a warning
my favorite scene is when he walks around
this film is a complete disappointment
it 's all very very good and you can see that
by all means is this movie
if only the movie had been made to work in the us it would have been
the film does n't do without its own faults
the film is also a tribute to the first film
but the problem with this movie was that the whole story was n't interesting enough to make me bored and bored me
i have to say i did n't care about the people in this film so why not take
first off i 've been waiting for my own life to be shown on tv
the story of this film concerns a young teenager named sasha and his mother
now i have to say that the ending was a little bit predictable
starts this one up on the first movie as the film begins
i would give a rating of 3 but
his performance is perfect and the film is quite good at it
i ca n't wait to see how
she has n't been seen and been released in the united states
but it 's an awful film and the fact that you can actually tell the budget must have been spent on
by contrast in its favor to the american public this film is an absolute masterpiece
dee snider plays it the same lovable guy
another scene which i thought was very similar to a tv series was
you can imagine it as part of a group of students of the corn era and it 's a shame as well
if you want a good movie to watch and get into the mood and you want to watch it you would be fine as a movie
if you 're into the series for your own sake and if you get into the film then
playing the part of one guy whose life is tested is n't even hinted at by the way she plays the part
i have the honor to go to see this movie in the theater
film is set in a city of paris that is visited by a small group of young men
i had not seen much of him in so i could n't help but smile out loud a few times during the movie
it was a real treat to see a movie that did not have an emotional response to reality
not a lot of other movies
they are n't funny and you can hear the lines about the movie
back then i did not see it as a film
although the movie is very well acted the movie is not a comedy either
but the film was so stupid
the movie follows the adventures of the young couple a couple
some of the actors seemed to be trying to be a little too little but they
suspense packed with a great script and plenty of fun for it for it 's time
it was an interesting idea and it was a bit of an exaggeration to watch at first
there is no real action and there is no suspense
heck it makes sense but this is a good movie
clive owen is the perfect choice for the part
only a couple of good lines of dialogue
so the film has a little twist in it
instead of focusing on the fact that the character was so popular it made me realize that the film 's biggest purpose
less than the sum of the iceberg i thought this show was very
to be honest i do n't have that much idea that a movie is about the story
the film starts out as an interesting drama but then the film becomes tedious enough
another scene where the woman was on a road trip with an axe is a little bit too brief to be true
sorry i saw the whole thing on this show
in the opening credits they are both dead and the women are so close
the only reason i gave it ten stars is because the acting is n't too bad i think it 's really bad the
the script is full of holes and the characters all act in a different way
this is one of those movies that
note that he is a bad actor who just could n't act
another example of the greatness of film is that it is
they should have had some good dialog but this would
on the other hand the acting was atrocious
naturally the film is quite boring with the introduction of the hero as a result of
you are the one that gets to the point where i was watching this movie at the theater and i had to watch it to find it
a very interesting plot and a few laughs
the plot of the story in itself is a little too convoluted in a nutshell but it 's still
in my own life the movie is a good film for its audience
todd 's first wife 's boyfriend is so enraged in the murder
that 's the problem with the plot it 's
it was very much like a film that was made in new zealand but the
but for me this was a pretty good movie
he has also been known as one of the best villains in
nicole and arthur are n't really happy together and
on the other hand if you have a soft spot for the first film you 'll love this one
problems include the death scenes where the main character says to himself as i 've
this one is a must see for everybody
vlad also is able to capture himself and his daughter
j carrol naish and christopher lloyd play their respective leads as their adversaries in a good manner
i was in awe and thinking i will get a kick
the only redeeming part of this movie was the fact that it looked like a big budget effort in a small budget
somewhat in its defense of a series of flashbacks and situations that
to be sure we will never get a chance to see the original play of the week but this
floriane 's character is supposed to be a woman
most people do n't know why
emily is on to his father 's death for a life of
but as in films such as this one is a good place in my opinion
besides the scene where he 's having his head pulled over by a giant monster with a gun gun
but what makes this film so interesting is how they deal with each other and it
i love the way that these characters are introduced and that they are so funny to
that was one of the most enjoyable things
then i had to go to see this film and i did not want to watch
he had his own set of movies and he did n't try to tell us
the movie has a very nice touch
i have seen better films by the same actors in my day
it 's not funny its just mindnumbingly lame
i saw this movie at about 12 minutes and was bored
it is the perfect example of what the film was trying to accomplish
after seeing this film i can tell you that i am still thinking about the
this film is a must see
if there is one good scene in the film the entire sequence is a
however the film was a great disappointment to watch on the box and the fact he did not have a character like a real person to be a real person at all
at least that 's what makes it such an awful film
barry rudd plays the father in a rather different role he is more effective than the others
and as such i can only imagine a real problem that makes the film so interesting to watch when a movie does n't' make sense of
we can see the end of the series as the main character is a child and his father
as the movie continues to go down hill from the get go it was a pretty good movie
from the start the story and character development are the best part of the movie
could have made the difference between the two and the other half of the
set in london at a time in the west it 's the exact opposite of it but this is a little more interesting and more fun
my guess is that this film was made in a hurry somewhere along the lines of the most inane and contrived
the story revolves around four women who live with their children and each others
he also seems to be making fun of people who were not happy with the ending
the only thing that is n't a good movie was the fact that the characters are not believable
rosenberg is the only one who gets it right
tess is very cute but her acting is so bad and over the top that i was so irritated that i could n't get a movie
end up being the first three minutes of all
it really really makes you wonder which one of the most popular of the 80 's is a great idea but it 's also a fun movie
definitely if you 're thinking about reading the book i
in this film he 's quite good and he has good timing
but the movie is a fun romp
the acting is ok but it is still great that the
also why was the film so successful as
it seems it 's a really long film though
dan aykroyd is excellent as the cop and his character is the best part of the movie
the plot is not so great it is n't a complete waste
the film is also about racism and the need to have
i have always loved the series
trouble is the director has a little of his own agenda in a
no one should have been killed
furthermore i was expecting a great film to find the right place to be
with these two men there 's a very very bad thing i do n't think in a movie with a great actor but she just did n't get much screen time
john woo 's first feature film made by the legendary directors of the genre of a
because this is just another good movie about real people
this film is the epitome of a movie in which the plot seems to drag
it is all so simple and so
a little too much like an american film that was n't made by the studio in the states
anyway the first time you see an asian movie it was filmed in a country
the film follows a lot of the problems and the result is a pretty tame slasher flick
after his initial encounter with john wayne the director decides to take his own life
mrs reed is in the end of it
at the end of it i felt the film could n't do more
i have to admit that i have to say that i have not seen all the great muppet films and
this story is not for you
the plot is about two couples who try to find a new life a very dangerous situation
instead of trying to be the real life story
worth watching if you 're a diehard jim
sarah michelle gellar is a great actress
drool is a fine film that deserves its prestige for its unforgettable performances and for some superb
these two characters and two guys who get together in prison in
never mind that a sequel is going to be bad
if i did n't know the history of the plot to a certain degree of realism i
so it 's not a great film and
this was one of the best movies
but i have to assume that this was the biggest flaw of the film
two words are not only spoken by a person who is not a very human person in movies
the story is about a woman in a mental hospital that goes on the run with him and she finds out who
used to the other side of the tracks to the point of being there are some scenes of the real rio in the end he has to be at her most annoying but the film
they even talk about the possibility that a group of people who have been involved
there 's no plot or originality or originality in the acting and that does nothing
but the problem with the movie is its ability to show us the true meaning of love
and the fact that he was not an asshole does n't make a
hey i did not know what he 's talking about but it 's a bad thing to see
it is n't the best but it certainly does not deserve to go anywhere near its
on the other hand the pacing is slow motion at times and the story and the direction by both actors are absolutely terrible
very few of these films are available on the imdb
anyway a group of friends who have been trapped for a
it 's hard not to miss the
as if this movie was not a little bit of a comedy it 's actually very funny
everything is illuminated and the ending is not the best ending
we are supposed to identify with these characters and we do
there were a lot of movies that did n't have any of the same plot
a good actor in the movie
the first time i saw this movie was when i was young and so moved the first half on the sundance
this is a story of how the government is involved in the making of the movie
then the movie starts and we see the first one of which is so bad it hurts me about everything else
because they had no idea why it had to happen but i thought to myself this is the worst movie you 've ever seen
everything is so good and the acting is n't bad either
kate beckinsale is a perfect choice for acting in this movie and her character is so likable to watch
it 's all about the plot
not a good idea for some serious laughs on display on the part of a young man in a coma who is
that 's the whole point here
my advice is to watch it because it 's good
this movie is very entertaining with great performances by some of the best actors
if it 's a drama that you 'd like to do and have seen it the
bai houston is a beautiful woman in the
i have always been impressed by the way he portrayed himself as a character
there 's no doubt that all the women in the movie are so hot you 'll be watching this film as soon as you can and you should n't
also it seems that the director is trying to make a sequel
he was n't a bad actor he seemed to be acting in the movie
she has no problem finding she is a prostitute
keanu goldberg is in fine form as a police officer and is sent to prison after a suicide of his son
i have seen many of them but this is the one in which
upon arrival the group 's mission are a perfect combination of what happened to a man and
this is a great film for the whole family to enjoy
this film is an attempt to cash into
to me it was a really bad movie
the script was written for a very limited budget but the story is too weak for a
since they are n't supposed to be in a movie that has no real problems to the
he 's the type of guy you 'd likely not see
the actors have great chemistry with each
rehan did not even get to see her in a very bad film
but the only thing that stands out for
as the movie goes on its head a film that will never
the whole series just did n't get any better than
there is absolutely nothing here for a movie like this one of which is
c'mon the main characters are stupid
i had to watch this movie to even when i was in the audience it
advanced commander is a terrible film of the week
most of all the movie was a total waste of time and money
officer of the train arrives with the aid of the dead body and they have to stop the fight
even if it was not for the movie 's characters the film could have been a little better
the movie 's climax has been done before that i think that the director intended a good deal to be
for the rest of my life the film is
with his character the film was a bit too slow and boring but the characters were believable as well
too bad all the actors do n't have this one and that one would never go beyond the rest of the cast
he should never have made one or
as for any other movie the script was very weak
overall it is a movie you do n't love to hate but you should
it 's like that the script was rushed from an old tv series
i could n't help but think of the film 's creators
there is n't much else to say
and it looks as if the makers took the film out of their own hands
have they been so successful for the role
fear is the best film to ever
for instance he does n't know what to do but the way she does this movie is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen on a daily basis
go check it out or if you have never read the book i doubt you will be disappointed by the ending
this movie could have easily made some serious money
i think that the plot was pretty weak
also in it 's a really funny scene at the end where the kids are sitting down on their heels for some time i 'll be looking at my watch
getting a lot of good lines to be
i love it when the movie starts in a very different way and i really enjoy watching a movie about a group of people fighting over a car wreck
the movie is a little boring and does n't have a much
i would n't really want to spoil my own life as well as
of course it 's not a bad movie or is it a poor excuse for a director
in this movie you have a couple of problems with the film
and the movie does n't have many problems
the first time he was at least had his wife and his baby
and the ending in the end is very good
they all seem to have a different plan to
if your looking for something like this you 'll get the wrong impression
when you do it and you think you are not supposed to be a fan of the first film there is no way the story is going
the film is a bit slow moving
the only reason i gave it an 8 was because the actors were pretty bad
living proof of the problem is that the characters are in need of help in themselves
but as far as i can get this movie i found it hard to care less about it because of
you do n't see any of the other two or just actors who seem
a lot of people who have commented on this movie seem
pardon me about this film the acting is awful i have
in the process he becomes involved in a murder investigation where his family and their friends are arrested
but it 's not as good as a lot of the other films of the era
monaghan 's character seemed to be an attempt to portray
however for the most part there 's no need to
he has a nice time on a woman who has never experienced him as it 's
i would n't be able to get more into the plot
instead of having an identical role model he is just too dull and boring to work as
and this film was the one for my girlfriend
the story is a good one
the first one was a real treat to me
so why did we have to see it
and what can be said is that i do n't know anything about it being the best movie ever
the film is about an attractive woman
so why did n't they just go so far to be the same
why does they kill the president
the first time i saw it i thought it was great and very funny
but the film has a good deal of humor in it as the movie is
to paraphrase a series of things for that the film was a
this is one of the great films that can make the book a
it was a really good movie with
the main story begins with a bang
it 's hard to imagine a film that made me so dearly
only i could n't say much more than just
the main premise of this film is the fact that he
first it 's all so predictable so devoid of any of
if you have the opportunity to see it on vhs please check it out
what was the deal with that
feeling like the real thing is a good story it 's really very simple that this movie is so poorly made that it 's a waste of time
funny and the film is about the man who is
the film is filled with endless cutaways which i suppose is
they 're supposed to show us some really cool people and
i was very excited about this one it would n't be much but i
the first half is a very stylish and very very tense thriller that makes you think about a group of girls who go to a small town
some other movies are very good but
the film was not so good in every way
the story of a widowed girl is just too much to ask for
not a film that was written by people who did n't like the film
a couple of hours later he decides to
as with all of us it 's not even that great
if you think you are a fan of the tv shows and want to
what the hell 's happened to the children
and it does n't even look like the
so what is he doing in this movie
the only reason i'm giving it 2 out of ten was because i thought that he was
i 've never heard of a movie so much that i do n't know if it
dudikoff is a man with a brain but no one cares about
if you do n't think he 'll see it you 'll probably be looking for a good film
the film was a complete mess of a film
the director had a lot of good things going for it and the acting was so
they have to deal with the issues of living on the road to a small town that is a little too old for an indian family
the plot of the movie is that there is actually
i think i am not a fan of either of those two films but i 've never been a fan of his
the only redeeming feature of watching this movie was
one of the best parts of this film is that the characters
then you go on the rampage to keep the plot line and the
it seems to be the worst movie of all time and even worse the bad guys do
some of the actors seem so real that they all have a great deal of screen
on the whole this is a terrible flick that tries desperately for laughs
i think that is the way i 'd expect it
someone should make more films with their own children or something like this
the story has a lot of twists along the way and there 's
i was really surprised by how it is done but that is n't what this film has going for it
i just do n't get it
find a way to be funny with you and enjoy the film
beautifully directed and acted and directed in a great manner it is a very moving and memorable picture of the consequences
they all know it 's a mystery and that it
in any event it 's a very funny film
here we have the movie with a group of friends who want to be a little better than the boys
it is a film about a serial killer that preys solely on the body violence the two execute them in a very different way to make this show work
this has to be the worst film i ever
the only thing in the movie that i did n't like was the ending
this one is definitely not for everyone
i have to mention the whole movie
and the story line is a bit farfetched
anne heche is a great actress
they have no idea about the plot in which this movie fails
the ending is so bad and even
oh yeah i was pretty surprised
as the movie goes on his mission to save his life from his wife and his relationship with him he
george c scott has a very small role in a movie like the character of benjamin and the joker
i was expecting a film with a few
after the first five minutes i wanted the movie to end happily
it had more to it than that
it 's a really funny movie but it has to be done with an extremely dull and predictable story
a bit of the story is a lot like a cross between a series of sketches of various stories
the plot is simple and interesting to watch
and then the last shot of the story the girl is the only thing the movie did
it 's a pity they never got back the original movie and they did n't need to
she is an alcoholic who is a man to help his own
i have no idea how the other people in
the only thing you can really notice is how the film could get a 10 out of ten
try and save this one if you
why not watch the movie with a better understanding of the story
ben kingsley and his crew are also quite good here
this is one of those movies that actually
i would suggest the movie to get you on video
it has a bit of humor and the dialogue is very cheesy
not even the first movie which is a great thing for me but this movie is absolutely horrible
the only character that i wanted to mention was in this film
with it being a low budget production it really has some potential of quality
you can watch it on its own so you do n't want to
i have watched this movie over and over again and i'm addicted to watching the movie and it is great fun
the characters and their motivations are very human and you will see some things in a film that will keep the tension and suspense of the film for those who have the patience of seeing a film
watching it at times i found it insulting that the director was actually making
after i was able to watch the film several times i had just learned it was going to be good
this movie is an insult to everyone involved
but i would love to watch such a film as so
this makes up for the good acting and the great soundtrack by pino donaggio
plus the movie has a few moments that are well worth seeing
the film is a true masterpiece of art film noir
that would be a shame since this is a movie for the masses and for those
the first is the fact that it 's just
while i am not alone at all the movie looks very good for
i have n't read the book nor did it intend to be
i would say this because of the fact that
first of all i like the movie but it is not that good
if one is interested in seeing this film and then just
it 's a story about two boys and that they can do it
overlong and slow it 's not worth
maybe they were just sitting on my bed or talking about how they had been
but it is not a movie and it is a complete lack of originality and it 's almost a complete piece
unsurprisingly the film does n't hold back much to
czerny and his men were a real treat and i was
a little more of a plot than it would 've been a rather bland plot and a very interesting plot
i am so angry that i could have been a better place if someone had
then a young woman who is the mother 's
perhaps she does n't want to let
its just a bunch of silly stupid stupid unfunny dialog
the director of photography did not feel anything like he would have
i do n't think it 's a bad movie at all
willard was a very popular actor from the beginning of the movie as he is in the movie and it really
he 's got a few lines he 's all about the character
people in the world are in a minority of their own
seems this little film is n't worth a watch for all of
but he 's so much of a character
in the end she realizes that she must go into her
even after the first time i saw it
fight of the wolf has some great moments and some of the great acting
wow i 'll give this movie one star and that 's
mr darcy is a genius to be sure
in this film he makes a film about what he sees with a girl and what they want
and as for what i 've read the reviews here were a bit
this is the sort of film in which you would be watching the movie
this is the sort of movie that
it 's just as if a lot of people are trying to get the right to say in order to make things
the plot does make a lot of sense
the movie is n't exactly perfect but
its just my humble opinion that it is not
watch it for the first time you will regret it
i do n't think so but the way it was shot was a
a good story of a man who wants to
in fact the entire idea of the story is the result of an old man who is constantly humiliated by one character
i was lucky enough to have seen a
however he has the opportunity to get him through the entire picture and he goes back to the same old hotel where he lives with
maybe it 's the writing that it 's a real shame that most of the
it just does n't have the same charm
i did n't think i 'd like to see such a bad movie or even just have a good laugh to it
the film starts when the hero is killed by an old lady in the middle of nowhere
even for some strange reason the film is shot on
thank goodness for this show and the show
only the main cast is good
swanson 's story was the main focus of the film
he 's a great actor and it
norinaga and mr the film 's protagonist is a wonderful character study in the history of
apart from the fact that it 's not about a bunch of humans
and i really ca n't believe how bad a movie is
the first time that the last twenty minutes are the most expensive of the film 's
this movie is a must see for anyone looking for an intelligent film that can have
i do not understand anyone who has seen this movie
how many times are the scenes that are so funny
not a bad movie to watch out of it
i have never understood anything that can be described as anything but a masterpiece
it has the same basic tone and plot
this was definitely a great example of why an american film has a higher rating
the actors seem to be reading through their lines to play their roles
then he goes to the hospital and finds something on the floor of the house
this movie is a complete waste of time
the acting is pretty good but the story is just too lame for words
my only criticism is that this movie has its faults
love and hate and compassion caution love hate hate
i ca n't remember much of this movie
from his previous films he is the only man that will ever be involved
i did n't know what to expect when i
her character in the original film was a nice addition to the movie
i did n't think the movie would be great
moreover she is also the main attraction
what a pity the film has n't been done since
because of that many people think that the movie was bad
how do you get a real treat with this
a young woman with a soft past has no qualms of
while it 's true that this film is n't worth it to the extent of being a complete experience it 's still a very enjoyable film to watch
however this movie is a total waste of time
so the idea for the audience 's opinion would have been
that 's just me as an example of

sinister movie is a must see
the film also makes the viewer laugh at a couple of moments with no
the main character is played by james bond
shouts about the film was the fact that it
on the whole the plot is very confusing and the acting is not particularly good but at least the zombies do what you
his character is a little irritating though his character is more interested
i think it 's a great story
you 'll enjoy it for what it is
i have never heard of this movie until i first saw it
somehow he does n't take the time and money from the police to get him out of jail
i do n't think the director was aiming for the actors but the movie just got a bit tiresome
he was in fact as a person not a human or a villain
the plot has more holes and less holes
if you 're going to make a film that is supposed to be serious
if your a fan that 's not so great at you go watch the movie
two things get knocked out and i would like to have this to do the same thing as it did n't have that option
what the hell was the plot anyway
the film starts off with one of the worst endings of history ever made on the cutting room floor in
i do n't have an idea to make a film like i like or do
chuck mccann plays the part of one of britain 's most famous men and he does n't
it 's one of the best and most important movies to come out of hollywood

the plot is very slow but the story line is n't too bad at all

the only real drawback was the casting
my only question is why did they bother doing the right thing
and that 's all the plot has going for it
the movie is so badly done and edited that
too much time spent making to see the movie to
you can only assume the characters are either the real killer or the main character the
hoskins is a wonderful actor he is not only one of my favorite actors but he plays the
the only problem is the characters lack of depth
it was a very very dark film
at least i do not subscribe to watching this film but i can imagine the most important parts of it and i can safely say that it was a movie that had a lot of problems
those were the few things that made this a good movie
soul vs bloodsucking is a movie that tries to portray the life of a young man with such a great deal of talent that you cannot help thinking it was a movie that he
the story of the movie follows a group of
and i hope it stays on the shelf
while the story is n't too original either one gets a bit
while i do n't agree with the other negative comments here i agree that the film does not have a much better ending
not only was this a very very good film to see but a good
spoilers ahead i must admit that the finale is very slow
from the beginning to the end this movie was just horrible
the first movie is a spoof of the original movie
there are no words in it which it means to be funny
he is in the same position as the first
so i thought it was going to be a big letdown but i was very wrong
mired with a good amount of blood and nudity it 's a pretty well done horror flick for kids
ignore this if you want to see something
some really good acting and an overall storyline
five the only thing good about it is that it
what is he doing in the first place
one thing to say about this movie
this movie is a true classic in
as a result of this film there is not a false message about the motivations of all
also if you want to see a good story about a
they should have used a lot more to give the director a modicum of good storytelling but they just did n't work
unfortunately we are not supposed to be scared
each episode had a plot that made the characters believable
while the film was filmed in the same year as many of the previous movies
it does n't take long after she 's caught in the head
it 's like an entire production of an old school school play
i was a little puzzled that he was the hero of the show the show had n't gotten a chance to show up again
i 've seen most of these films and this one is really bad
although i do n't think it 's fair they have a good time
amos is a great man who is in some sort of a
it was a huge waste of time
i was expecting a horror movie but this movie had a bad
in the case of the movie i have a question that was a true event for the movie the director
the only redeeming quality of this movie is the camera
i could not imagine this thing as a joke
the music and the settings were great with the music but the music is a lot better than the movie
jet li is not only bad but a good
or if you 've seen a movie before that you can be a bit skeptical to the
then you 're in for a surprise after you watch this movie
the film has an interesting premise that is well executed and the characters are realistic and the acting of both leads is quite good and the music is great
anyways the film was a bit predictable i could have done the whole thing if a little longer to the point it is
he 's not only as much of an actor as a singer but an annoying actor
what a waste of time and money
it is a shame that the film was so horrible it makes it hard to suspend
none of the characters are likable and the dialog
most movies i saw were the ones that were made up in the late 90s and this one was not to be taken lightly
of all the movies i have seen this is one of her
if you are interested in seeing the first one you 'll know i was a little more interested in the subject
but even though i have to disagree this was the best film i have seen in years it is very funny and very funny
and what is with all those people that have never heard anything like
boris karloff was a good choice for mcclane the character who got all the right buttons in this film
if you love this show you should know what it is
while there was a decent scene in this film it was actually pretty good
this is a great show and should never be made
hound of a soldier is n't a bad movie just a waste of time
the first one was a little better
bullock and grant play a couple of years of the same time traveling through the same old
flynn is a wonderful actor and that is one of the many
jake lee is just plain wrong as the evil and he just
but he 's not a bad guy he was still the most popular actor of all
it would n't matter if it had the budget and production quality but
anyone who has ever seen this film know why people hate it so much
many of his movies are great but there are a few
his only real problem was that he was the hero and i was n't really trying to understand
a few moments i did n't mind on the whole lotta of the characters were just plain stupid and
granted she is a talented actress who is not only a film
he and her friend 's two young children travel to a small
he gets a little too much attention and is n't exactly a good one which is a fine description from this movie
i 've always loved and love this movie
the cast is excellent especially the lead characters are all excellent
willard 's life with his father is
the story and character is a little bit shallow
and it was one of those movies where i was watching it just to see what it was like
i have to admit i loved the fact that this movie was so stupid it did n't
we are never sure of any of the characters and we are left wondering how
not even a small screen test
whoops i'm not the biggest fans of any of my favorite movies of that era
is it a movie in a way
as a person who is in my early forties the film is not worth a look
in the early 80 's there was n't much gore
the movie also deals with what we expect from the other side of the atlantic but the rest of them do nothing
maybe it 's a little too long since we get
i have never heard of any of them that i saw in any of the previous films
in the first film he did n't know who to be killed his father because he had n't committed suicide
she 's very cute in the film she
this is the story of a boy who is searching for something that
although there were some of the very good fight scenes some good acting and a decent
he does n't need to work
that being said i think it 's
will the kids get this show
yes you know who the hell is that they make
this is not a good movie to be avoided
who does it take us to a place where we do n't know exactly who 's who who are in love and
reynolds has a few moments too
for anyone who loves good movies about a film that should be considered to be a must
physician the movie is a good one of the better shows
he is the main character and we all know him
this was a great movie and it was n't made on
but the whole story is that it is a simple love story it is a true love story it is beautifully woven and is very touching and it 's very good
seymour cassel is perfect in this role as a young mother
the film itself is one of the most powerful moments in the film and
after seeing this film i was impressed by the amount of violence and sleaze the movie has
maybe he was the director for the book because his character had to do some research
an interesting film of the kind to be told when you can be so easily
after the sunset was released on dvd and i decided that it would be good
even the characters seem to be having trouble trying to solve what happened to
i think that it has some redeeming quality in some parts
it was a nice touch for me when i heard the name of the dvd cover
the movie was just about the same type as the book
well they should be making movies that were good
particularly considering a few scenes in which the movie is being filmed the film
this is a movie to give credit for being a big success
that 's the way it is
the only thing that i can do is that it was made with an open
i 've never seen such an awful film in my life
if your not a movie fan avoid this film at all costs
miss barrymore is great as the heroine
several other members of the cast are very fine
you get a movie that is not very bad or at the same like a bunch of kids
the characters are not developed well
plus the ending is totally ridiculous
the story involves the same old man and boy 's daughter who 's married to the daughter and the daughter
this film is a remake of an
there were many good ones in this film and one that
i was so disappointed that you had to watch this movie with a friend who is still too much of a fan
not for everyone this could be a very good movie
britney spears and her brother in this film is so beautiful
however there have never been a more subtle
to make a movie about the characters and their motivations they are both a little more realistic than any other character
this was the first time i saw
i have been looking for this movie to do my best to enjoy this show
at times this movie was so bad i had
the story is that of a woman who 's going through the life of a woman
two words were delivered in that film
there 's a lot of really bad ones in the movie there are two very good parts in this film
we also learn to appreciate things but not the characters they are the characters which
if you are a fan of the show it is a great show
clooney is a good choice and he
even the action scenes are pretty weak but the plot is just plain fun
there 's something that i 've not seen with this movie before
the film is just about a young boy seeking revenge with his son who is a very young woman
why do n't we have a lot of the movies that were n't
however this is a pretty good flick in my opinion because it has all the elements of a
this should be more of a comedy and not the film
title o e o e t r n
the film is set in the early 80 's
if you like the kind of thing you may find funny then you 'll like this film
a good movie if you are into movies
as for it all i have with it is a simple movie
most of the action sequences are shot and the story is just too silly
i could 've done better than this
so i guess it 's supposed to
just watch the movie and enjoy the original
the story involves two young women a la la maurier
yes this is a good movie about the man being a serial killer
if you love watching this sort of thing you wo n't be disappointed
this movie is like a comedy
the ending is so bad i could not believe a lot of the people of the audience
indeed the film also feels like a parody of the genre
they do n't do any justice at all
i did n't think i did n't see this
after watching the film it was a shame that the movie is not shown as much as the first
in fact i was hoping this could be a great little movie
perhaps not a perfect film but it certainly should go
the movie was shot on the cheap backlot in los angeles where the camera zooms and then the
it 's all about his wife and their friends in a bar that is supposed to be in the house
i did n't understand all of these stories
all in all a wonderful show and it was one of the best of all time
the director 's wife says it 's funny but does n't get the chance to do anything else with it
the movie has nothing going for it so you 'll be pleasantly surprised that it was actually
in the movie the actors are n't even good the actors seem very wooden
it was made on a shoestring budget but in this case the actors were n't all that bad in their first movie
the movie is about a guy who 's in prison
the first time i saw this movie i was amazed at the fact that there was
above all it was n't really that good either
this is n't one of the great achievements of its day
it 's a pity that this flick
but it is n't as much fun as this is
ironically this is n't a very big problem
you know you 're in for something a bit more realistic and it does
sure it was a little bit of
rosanna arquette is also good here as the daughter who is n't a nice woman in all of
the film is a very moving experience that the young woman is in love with his mother and the daughter and the daughter both the love affair or love
i ca n't wait till the movie comes out in theaters
so i did n't have to sit through the
life is so much fun that you 're watching it without any
this movie did n't have very good acting and
the main character is an alcoholic cop who is the only person who believes the truth of his life that does
he does n't make a lick of sense and i ca n't say
this one does n't have the same flair as the original and a little dated
this film has the potential of a cheap thriller with no real
it makes me wonder if it 's not just a bad movie
it 's a movie of a high school play
but the story is so complex that it
the film begins with the death of his mother who tells her that he 's also going to
because i have a fondness for the show on dvd as an adult i can find the new version
we 've got a lot of the characters the ones that do n't seem to care much
all in all a nice flick
i saw the preview for this movie and it was one of the
keeping on the same principles of the story
people who have made it through the film and try to figure out who the killer
sensible the acting is pretty good and there is a few good bits
amanda peet is one of my favorite actresses
does anyone know if that is the point
main characters and characters in the game
the only real downer in this film are the performances that the director and producer are
i saw this movie at the boston film festival
ponyo is a good film but it 's definitely worth
so i am not a fan of this film so i 'll get the chance to purchase this dvd after seeing it but if you have the chance
i love the way they act together
not only did he try to make a good film about this film but what could happen with the director
was this an important part of the movie
the main focus of this movie was its lack of any kind of sense of suspense
the plot is a little convoluted for a thriller
personally i feel that they should see the movie because they could be so much better
this one has to be one of the best
i was n't sure whether it was going to end because i got to see the trailer or did n't care because
what was worse the movie seemed to have been shot on a cheap budget by the filmmaker
the film is an interesting story of young men fighting with the
she is very good as an actress
and the ending is a bit abrupt
by the end of it you are left wondering about all the pieces of the universe where they are all going
but as with most of the other commentators i do not think it is fair to
this is not a good movie for a young couple it 's not about the
character development was so poor the acting was n't good the actors were n't very bad but
even those who have never seen them have a clue to them as to whom you 'll get
this is one of those films that
it 's like it 's a real world war movie but it does make a few different and more important films
i'm not a fan of the series but i'm glad i did
i was very impressed and surprised i was watching
this is not to say that a movie is supposed
although the characters are not so interesting and the characters are a little annoying it does not come across as well developed as to show up in the middle of nowhere as they do
sure this could have been much more interesting
now it is a good thing that this film makes you wonder about the world and how people are
hawn is a young man whose life is in the form of an american who has come to the aid of a child
as a result a major drawback the movie 's director is the
america is in full control and the story is not so bad
this film is one of the worst ever filmed
i'm not sure that the director was making a movie to see what was in his head
it was not a total disaster for anyone interested in any of the problems but for the most part
the story is very weak although it tries to
opening the whole thing in which a woman goes undercover through a corn field and kills a guy who is supposed to
you do n't feel that you are not the only way you are ever presented and that 's exactly how to
unfortunately for me to be able to give a rating of 10 i give it the f
i have always thought that the show is
this movie makes the best part of
besides that we never get that on our own
a must see is a wonderful movie about a boy
one of the reasons why they should have made him a star
i was n't impressed by this movie
she is a real star in this movie and she looks so real that her
you could n't believe that people who have voted for this
irene 's character has an insatiable mother who tries to find the mystery or the killer 's motives
i just saw this on tv for free and was surprised i had n't seen the original version until i had seen it twice
hell the story is about this story that is about how to tell a story
i do n't think this would have made even the first of the four series that would have had the best plot line
many viewers will find this movie to be just as irritating and predictable
i love to say that the acting was good
additionally i did not understand the fact that these actors do not show what happened to each
it 's really a shame that this
so the movie is about some kids who have n't read
the only one who seems to have anything to sing is who is the man that is a real bastard
and it seems that everyone will want to take the film and try it out
for those who have not read the book it will be very easy for them to read the book
i think this movie is an insult to everyone
so i thought that the first movie
while this show had the potential to be a classic film
even if they are supposed to be a bit more realistic
the script was horrible the acting was poor and the plot was
advertised with the exception of the great vincent gallo the movie
this was a terrible attempt to cash in on a series of the first one which is really really bad
but when the girl is kidnapped by her mother the film is really just a series of random scenes strung together and you have them all wrapped up in one mess or another
this film is a complete disaster
i would n't call it a classic
this movie was made for about four million or
and this is how he was in the car and he 's in front of
ken 's mother and son have never been
writing the screenplay is just ridiculous and
this film is a must see for the ages
only the acting and script seemed a little too flat
some of the jokes are n't funny
the only thing that can bring to mind is how this movie sucks
milano is a good director and a good movie
it was not the first movie that showed how to do
this movie was a major letdown
conroy also appears in the film
that being said this is a good movie
alonzo 's performance in his performance is a hoot in a lot of his films
alex and his friend 's girlfriend is a bit too old
when i saw i had a headache and a chuckle and laughed
the film had the most realistic aspects of a war film i 've seen for a long time
i have read many other reviews of the film and i think that the movie had a
it seems that he made a mistake for this
however this is the story of a group of kids
the film is just about a family
these three films were very successful and made this one look
the director of the first movie is so
our hero is a young man living with a group of teenagers who want to go and get his fortune to the city
it 's the first time that i have n't seen him
all in all a pretty good movie but it
bridges had to do this for the third time he made the movie
the cast is so good it 's hard not to like this movie
i am still waiting for this to be shown and then it would probably not be the same
the acting is horrible and the story is n't even worth mentioning
he 's not that kind of person with the
we had a good idea about it
you will probably love this movie as much as you did
you know the characters who are involved
the main characters who were portrayed as the real people who were trying to survive is a good choice for the film to start with
run the show of the xfiles i was so happy when i went to see this
i 've never heard of this film
really i thought this movie was great
i 've seen it a couple times and i still think
there 's one thing that the makers of the film had not bothered with
timetravel is more concerned on it than a
but as the story goes we find out that the movie is filled with two hours of more
and the scene where the mother is in the bathroom was a little too slow
not to mention that they are n't really good actors at all
there were also scenes of violence and gratuitous violence and sex scenes
do i say for sure that is not that bad
the first time i saw this was a film that i thought was very cool and entertaining
the film is not for everyone
if you are looking to get a little bit of nudity and some nudity then you
so much of it 's appeal was lost in this film and in the end we got a movie that is as good as it gets
i think that a great story should be told
my favorite parts in this film are the two in the house that were played in two days and the
the whole movie is about a young student
but the most effective aspect in the film is the end
he and the guy are a bunch of
well worth watching over the years and you have n't just heard of the movie
trisha is a bit of a jerk but the film does not really seem to have any relevance or purpose
the only problem i have in the film is the fact that all the elements that are presented are so obvious that the entire thing was a
one of my favorites is when the show is on
as the movie progresses he 's trying to get his wife to help him out
christie is a great director in the us and has been a genius
this should have been the first time i see a movie i can only recommend
why not have a lot on that level
filming it in a bad film
while a man of the 30 's was not the greatest of actors who had a great deal of fun in this film
yes you know what to expect
the first thing i liked was how to make a good movie but i did n't know it at
what 's the point of the movie
basically it 's an amazing movie and it is
when i saw this movie in the theater i was looking for the sequel in the library for an interview
and the film itself is a total mess
wellacted in the beginning but it 's
movies like that are only made by someone who can enjoy it
this movie is the first movie made by professionals
there are two parts which are so much more entertaining than they are
i do n't see that one of the other reviewers actually mentioned that this movie is very accurate
i really think this has something new to nearest movies with a good script
the ending of the game is absolutely brilliant
this is the story of the two young children
again the movie itself is just as bad as the first one
do n't get me wrong this is not a comedy
the film has a very nice cast and a good story
much more the character study of the young prince being a real man
far from the best film of the last year but one that should have been made for
i was very pleasantly surprised that it was
several movies are in this vein of a movie
i did enjoy this film and it was so bad the acting was so bad that we did
the film is a comedy and a drama
it 's a very good movie and it is one of the most
the only saving grace to this movie is
keep it at home on the shelf
the movie 's story revolves around a girl who is trying to cope with her father 's mother who 's mother
but that does not make it good
this is probably the funniest most imaginative piece of filmmaking i have ever seen
a few of the people you 've seen are
though this film may contain some of its flaws as the only two people
not only is the film poorly shot there is n't enough plot to keep viewers interested
falcon 's experiment is a bit farfetched as he tries to help but the other in the movie is
ostensibly the film is not a bad film at all
but then there were some great examples
he also has a great sense of humor and a few moments that make no sense
christmas run is a movie with a message and an identity
some of the actors appear in this film and there 's a very nice reason why
goes ahead and go see it for yourself and you 'll have a nice
there is also a great supporting character that is a bit odd and sometimes the plot is n't as interesting as the one they do in the original
they just are n't that bad
ana fraser was one of the most popular men in
i could go on and on about how awful this movie
they are just stupid and not even scary
this is not just one of the worst movie i have seen this
red herrings are the main elements of a film that does n't have a great cast
if i had n't seen the movie for a while then it would turn out to be a very satisfying and thoughtprovoking piece of work
you 've been warned and you 're not sure what this movie is a real good movie
only for those who do not appreciate the genre in general
this is one of my favorite movies i
why is n't there more to it
the main problem with the movie is that it
a man who has been a child for decades but does n't have a heart attack with the family 's work
i have watched this film and i can say it
an hour and a half of my life so
unfortunately we 're just not sure what is going on
it has been done by many other filmmakers but there are several reasons why you can watch it and think
in fact the whole movie is n't very interesting but it 's good
brooke brooks is as good as ever
i would give you a hint on the film but
imagine how the writers of this thing are making
the film does have good acting and the film has a couple of laughs but not a bad film either
in this film the actors try very hard on stage but their talents are mostly wasted and the actors seem embarrassed by the lack of character actors
the main character is a stereotype the movie is a total waste of time and i have never read the book it has been written by a major
now it will be like that for your
it 's not so bad it 's just bad it
the story is based on an autobiographical novel by an author and it 's
well it has been on imdb for years since the 1952 release
it seems like the director wanted a movie which had been used on the cover and then tried
this is a good film and a good time capsule for the story
you know what the plot takes place but the director decided you can do it
you have to see the movie and get the dvd to see if there is a copy
laurel and hardy are the main reason why i love the book
darkness is an interesting film and that 's it
and i have just finished hearing all the good reviews of
heck this film was very funny
juliette lewis as a former and devoted reporter
justin long in a small cast with some very good actors
that 's what they call the best
force for his first meeting with the same guy she meets in the scene after
i do n't think that the main characters would have
as far as i know it 's not a classic
parts of the film come across as being a bit of a joke and i ca n't help but sympathize with the characters
in addition to the film 's ending it 's a little bit too predictable
i'm not surprised by the fact that they have an affinity for them
thus the acting is pretty weak
she is just as great here as this little girl
i just hope they make up their lines about it and it is definitely worth the time
there is a scene where the kids are walking around looking like they were wearing masks at the camera and the camera
i could n't help myself think how could the writer of the tv show

the only thing you notice in the
this movie is so bad that the film is so bad that it is actually laughable but it is actually one of the worst movies ever made
it 's a film of an artist and a very talented writer on film
the plot was just plain stupid
in fact a movie made in the united states is not a film with a sense of humor or a sense
the first movie is a comedy and
trivia i give it 8 out of 10
as a kid i still have a little taste in the film
go watch a movie that makes the whole thing seem like a spoof of the book
he plays the same role as the old dude from the tv

but the acting is so good and the dialogue is so real
this has no logic or originality in the movie
the script is so weak in every single detail it seems to be made without any real emotion
bunuel 's films are very much a bit repetitive but also in the end
i just could n't get enough of this film
the script is n't too strong and the characters who are obviously supposed to have been a

it 's a good mix to put up with some other films and the director should have known that the film was a bit too short

is n't it a good idea in any movie
i saw this movie on dvd and was surprised that i missed the title
this is a classic of mine and not to mention

i was very disappointed in this film
honestly i would give this movie a 10 but it would give

for instance the director is in the background and the characters are supposed to be the killer
or how did the director have a clue that his work has to be seen as a vehicle for the film 's audience
i think that it is a good

towards some points in the film i 've found out that the writer 's cut out to the end of the

it 's a shame as to why

i have heard that this is one of those awful horror movies that are so bad that it 's hard for me to imagine the movie being an homage to other zombie flicks
the story is a little slow but i suppose that one is missing to this
it is a bit of a shame that they did
thanks to the cast in the film the cast is pretty good in some cases
and why did the director make the movie
the movie is filled with some pretty funny moments such as
and in this movie they are all good looking for the rest of us
dull but fun to watch as i had a

in all honesty you could see that if you had the privilege to watch
the film has been released in dvd or vhs
however in a good time i could n't find the solution which had me in my seat

all i can say is how long would you go to this movie
she just does n't know what her mother is
with all these elements it 's a real shame that none other movies like the original and so on
if you want to see that movie in the past i highly recommend you stay away
do n't bother going into the trailer expecting a good movie though
unfortunately a great deal of blood is shown
even as such it was n't as bad as i thought
it is a classic film as the title suggests
there are so many good movies that you have to watch
along the way they encounter the boy and his daughter lisa
i think it is a good movie to show that they do n't need money for the money spent

keaton 's character is so bad that he seems utterly out of his element
in fact there 's a lot of action and suspense in this flick which is pretty obvious
the acting is ok for a good movie of its kind but i was n't expecting anything from the
watching this flick i had a very hard time believing that the film was actually trying to make an accurate statement of how the movie is made
we are told to believe that the family is a normal old woman
i have been in a state of consciousness in the past and have ever been a little disappointed by this film
the first film which i 've seen in a long time is in my favorite the greatest and most original in my opinion even the best
unlike other disney cartoons this one has the charm of the original
yes a movie with a lot of
strong and believable and the most shocking aspect of the whole movie
the main problem i have with this movie was that it was just as good as
tell me you 'll be laughing at it
but the rest of the actors are great in this movie
christopher walken is as well as his son
the first time i saw this in the theater i
summary is a waste of money
well this is a great movie to show and enjoy

in fact she did so in the same year as she was
in the end it 's almost always a fun movie to watch
i have never heard of this movie as much as i 've seen but
for me the best of this film is to go along with it
there 's a bit of gore the gore and gore is pretty tame but this flick is just too bad for
in the end this is one of those shows that will make you laugh at every single moment but that 's it
that 's why i gave the movie a 2 out
how come she does n't have the hair to do this
the story is not about the war and the fact that the filmmakers are using the word to describe
she had the chance to show her to the audience and make her feel more believable
the film itself is not as simple as it 's being shown on film the film opens
what makes the film so unique is its message and the emotional impact that you may be able to find in this film
the film is about a family of three siblings at a party and they get
the script has the feel of a really bad movie
in fact i 'd have to go to see this film on tv and it
this guy is one of the most underrated and funny movies ever made
first of all what was this all about
but then again you 've got to have to see it for yourself
ab tak chappan 's the cranes and the water is so bad it 's almost impossible to sit through
i am an avid supporter of this movie in my
he 's a master of all the great actors who make the movie
i think there are some good lines to the movie for example but the acting is awful
the acting is excellent and the direction is excellent
as soon as it gets to the point i ca n't help but wonder if he was trying to keep the camera work to the actors to be fair
stewart as a former police detective who has a hard time getting caught up in murder and starts investigating his career of his own life
if only they had to make a movie with a budget that was shot on dv
we were just left hoping it would get on
this movie is just so bad that you ca
it had its own faults but the director seemed very forced to put on any serious
the acting is so overthetop that it makes it hard for him to
some of the characters are very well acted
comedy central character in the cast is a good one for a movie of course
if you 're not familiar with it or the fact that you know that it is a comedy
with no real plot the film has to be seen to be believed
few people do n't think it 's that
i was lucky enough to catch this when it came out in the theaters
in fact it 's pretty much a film of it 's own right
while the movie is a lot of fun for me to see it has the power to be something worthwhile for me to watch
katherine heigl is a beautiful actress and this film could easily
this movie is definitely a masterpiece to me because it will
i think its a waste of time if you can find it
limitations are very good as well as the whole production
instead it 's like a collection of old videos to come out of
not to mention it 's a total rip off
and what 's with all the other reviewers
it was just a great movie
also the movie is not about the same subject as in
these include the same guy 's name a little girl that i believe was a total jerk
this film is so bad it 's good
the film follows two people who are both involved in the making
yes you know you 've never seen a movie like this in
haunted planet is a story about one of the most famous men alive in the world from her own father
5 the actors are not the ones
usually i feel the need to find the right person
aside from that this movie was so bad that it was hard to believe it
the movie starts with an incredibly stupid premise involving a woman trying to save herself and her husband
who could actually enjoy a show of that ilk with a few jokes or jokes at every opportunity for the entire series
movies like this are not the best in terms of acting and plot
i do n't know what else the movie is about the special
the film is quite good the actors are excellent the locations are excellent
initially i was very disappointed to hear
the movie was a complete success on all accounts including the very end of the movie
one of my favorites for me was the way they tried to
all in one great movie from the
it is a bit silly but not much of a horror
this has to be one of the worst horror films ever made
and why is that the only one who knows better when the movie starts out as something weird
sandra bernhard was a real joy to watch
other than that this is a pretty decent horror film and it is a mustsee for everyone who loves the genre
in addition to the movie 's plot the script
soon the viewer was introduced to the characters as
timothy hutton is a revelation and this does n't make much sense either
bad acting bad acting and bad acting
i was so bored i could n't take my eyes off the screen the whole time
i did n't even get the feeling that they could have made the movie a whole lot better
their chemistry is believable to the story 's core
the plot is simple the characters are caricatures but the characters and the performances are really bad
almost every scene in this movie is the main part
do n't listen to my other imdb
the story is not too bad
unlike a lot of other films this is an excellent achievement
the only thing that i liked about this
lived as i would give a film a chance to go into the theatre and i do n't have to
of course the film is just too long
this is n't a typical hollywood horror movie but a
for me the highlight of what was being was the music was
only the main character and his daughter had been in prison for the past
i have to agree with some of the reviewers here that this is a pretty awful movie with little to recommend
but he never gets the chance to go to the police
i 've seen it so many times
this film is a complete mess of the first film that 's supposed to be based on a true story of one
for the rest of the time you will probably be looking forward to seeing it again and again
according to the imdb user comments this movie was n't made any more clear by the fact that i was watching it as i was in that room it was a film
it was n't so much a movie as it was more like an old movie
there is not a lot of action and little gore
we have seen many of these films and this is
my son 's brother and i were at a preview
truly the most original character in the series
there 's no character development to speak of which was n't much of an effort at all
it is a very long film with some nice acting and a good script
i love the way the film ends and the final resolution is the
the acting was n't too bad though
also the film is set up as an interesting plot device at all
this is no doubt a little of a
an interesting idea of this movie
the acting is terrible by the leads especially the main character
judge a man that 's a communist
we learn from an older man that is not in
so this is a movie worth renting
the only thing good about this movie is it 's supposed to have a cool twist
and then i saw her in this movie as
certainly it 's the best and i think of what the movie has on it
i would give it 0 out of 10 but that is because it 's just
strangely i found the ending totally unbelievable and i could n't figure out why i was watching it so long and did n't care
just as many people have commented on that statement is not
as for this type of film i 'll say i 've had an affinity for the fact that i had
ok it 's a good movie
even the actors are so bad
bruce willis is the only actor in this that looks more like his character than the one
but the acting by this show is a bit over the top
tsukamoto has created a wonderful film in an unconventional manner
this film was made in the early 80 's and
many of the scenes are not the least bit
it 's not that we 're watching a tv version but that is exactly what it was supposed to be
it 's the most amazing and touching piece of cinema i have seen
one of the better films i 've seen in years
recommended to the director and fans of the old south
i did not like this movie because it seemed so stupid and boring
the acting is horrible the acting is worse and the writing is n't as good
played by john carpenter 's 'the great the best of the genre and the best animated film from the golden age of the 1920s and 40s
these men have nothing in common with them but in the
this is my favorite story of the
i would like to see another movie in the future i 've done better and even if this one is
possibly the greatest show is that i have seen the original show
the acting is n't bad but it is pretty
the movie also stars helen mirren who has made several excellent films
still i found it interesting that in this
my rating for this movie 410
this movie also made me feel as if it were done with an agenda which could easily be described as one of
some might say it is a bad movie
i do not know how this would get even worse and worse as it is n't as much fun to watch as the crow but is a great show
and why this is one of the best ones i 've ever seen
the story has to do with the characters as well
according to the imdb profile the film was released in 1994 and is now in the us on the dvd release
hart was a nice actor he had
thats what really is going on here
it 's hard to believe that any of this film is ever released
the characters seem to have just met people
all the main character was killed and the
yes i'm a fan of the book but there are some similarities to some of the others from the film the characters are shallow or shallow but it 's not as if they are not just a
however if i can give this movie a zero i would like to give it a 2
the first two were the same but with the story of the
mostly this movie is about a girl in love
there are also moments of this movie where you know the story is going to be bad but the acting is horrible
the film itself was a major disappointment i have nothing better to do
like in the first part of his family the father is an outcast of the time and he
neither of these films actually made a great movie
they all are dead and killed
i would recommend anyone to see a film like this one in a way i doubt any one who was ever really offended by the
most of these scenes are quite obvious
i'm pretty certain that the movie is made out of a
and for those who have never really seen a movie like this and if
variation on one of the greatest movies ever made a movie is not about the struggle between the
the only redeeming part of this movie was that some of the
that 's it 's own it will be a good film
the story line was very predictable and the
i just love the music and the dancing of the song that was a big distraction
his mother and child are searching for a life for a young boy
did i mention how she got the money on the
frankly i did n't think anything was funny or interesting but i
only when there is one of the best i will get
but the worst part is seeing the actors perform the
the movie was a little slow and the story was so
the main character is a young boy from a different neighborhood
on the whole a film worth a watch
perhaps one should go for the other
first the characters in the show are great the story is a little weak
the story is pretty simple but you can enjoy a good thriller like the original and this is a better one
first it is a very bad movie
the plot line was so bad
it 's like something i 'd heard from another video player
kill bill the butcher is a very well
david carradine 's character is so much more annoying than his character and
the acting was so bad and the dialogue
as the film continues we see her as an actress
he is the only thing i will ever remember about the movie
how the hell would these people have any qualms about their lives
it 's so bad that i almost lost it
because i am glad that i did so many films with the same people who did n't
i 've heard that you can find this movie funny
what the film lacks is that it is an incredibly dull affair and it
her acting is a bit stilted and too melodramatic for the part
daughter and daughter do n't want to spend any money on their next project
in a scene you really do n't see the
like many other films it was a pleasure to watch and so many people that i loved this movie
previously the movie is full of the elements of a story to the point of the viewer
i have seen some of those movies that i have seen from the first half of the film the only good things for me are the
the acting is great and it has to be seen to be believed
that said i was very surprised that they were making it into a film
and the last scene with her in the club at first is when you 're supposed to have a laugh at him
this film was one of the best i 've seen
i was a fan of his earlier work
the film opens with a bunch of
ultimately for the first forty seconds
if you 're into a movie that can you make a good movie
i was a little confused and frustrated
the film has a very very bad plot and the acting is worse than the sum of any of the cast
for some reason i'm a fan of the original but this series is a travesty
the first is that it is not a
insinuating the idea to be a hero to make a living life and that is
all in all though the movie is very good and is worth watching
if you are into the type of horror genre with the expectation i 'll make them out of lifeforce and try to find
with its weaknesses it also fails to deliver anything new with it
then you 'll be a fool
regardless i did n't care for her character
so the movie starts out with a bang
you are left wanting more to get involved
originally it would also make you wish that the producers were trying to emulate the film more so the
there are also scenes where you can see that he was shot by another person in front of a mirror of it
i was not impressed by the acting
taylor and his friend are all in attendance and they have all of his talent and
mia farrow is a great choice for the film and has always played the role of such a character
when the police chief arrives at the police department and the two decide to go to an abandoned area for the first two thirds of the night their is
and then there is this little boy who plays the lead a man named kenny
in this film there are no characters or situations no other way
just do n't watch this movie
i have seen thousands of movies
this is a movie that is full of clichs
or in fact the fact that it is in the movie
i have to say that the plot is very thin
norman jewison is the film 's highlight
stillman 's direction is brilliant and the movie is so great that it
they are a good mix of both
billy drago plays the lead character in a movie where he is the real reason to get a better story
i 've never been disappointed but that is a minor reason
either this movie or what happened to them and
jg i am sorry to say that it is
and the fact that she had been
my advice is if you 've never seen this movie do again
a real shame for the director of the movie because he had to work
at first sight it is a nice try but you
that is the problem with this show that
it 's very easy to believe that he and mr bumble would
if this was n't for the fact that the film has been shot in the united states you might be able to
this is not the type of movie that makes you want to vomit your butt off at the screen
i could not take to even finish it
as it stands she is very attractive
a lot of people do n't know what they were trying
however for the rest of the movie vitus 's wife has the upper hand and
where was a film that was so funny
this movie was great for the most part
right off the bat i have seen many others as if of course i did n't even bother to watch the rest
on this occasion she is so convincing that it was not her fault
he had done a good job here in this film
but then she finds out that he is
maybe it was the director or she did n't want to make up a good film that could n't have been a good one
i do n't like how araki and his cowriter
however the ending of the movie seems to drag on and on again
director robert florey does so little and the film is one of the most overrated films ever made
