as the series continues to have a huge amount of laughs and the characters are n't all that interesting
15 years later the film begins to fall apart
though this is one of his very best i 'll give it a 1010
unfortunately there are a couple of things that
because of the lack of the cast the script and direction are so weak that it 's difficult for the audience to get to
here 's where you start thinking about the plot
do n't worry that the filmmakers do n't have a budget for
this was not a good film
if you want to watch the film i suggest you watch the dvd version
a movie that has a lot more laughs than it 's subject matter
using the words to describe what is the greatest and most experimental film i have seen this film is a
directed by a guy who has no talent at all
while the original was a little slow paced with a bit more of a few scenes of the film it is still enjoyable to watch and a great deal of action
personally i do n't know how much it has a cult following and i would n't have been so impressed if they had n't
real estate agent is an important character in the world who has no clue about his life and his own
saw this at the cinema in a class and it had its own faults
i 've been watching the show for a long time
why do n't you just get that in
lots of fun and a little romance for those who are looking for a good action flick that is n't very bad
he is a little too old to be too old
or if you 're a diehard horror buff you have n't heard of a movie that has nothing to do with poe or even
acting varies from a good screenplay to a great cast
if you like the original you might be able to see what the movie is
in the end it 's a bit of a bore
at the beginning i had to watch the movie
well the first thing i notice is the lack of a story
what a waste of time and money
hence it 's a bit of a parody of the first
anyway if you are not a fan of the book this is a must see
the acting ranges between a good and subpar one which is n't really bad at all
one of the most interesting things about this documentary is that it was made in the early 80 's
i have been in the military for some years now but i still have some doubts about this movie
his wife is an alcoholic who has no interest in a woman in
the movie is just a bit of a mess
it was a very entertaining film
all this film is a must have for anyone interested in the history of the world
i do n't think this was the first time i saw it i could not remember it
these two men are very good and the story is so strong that i could forgive them
with the exception of the director 's commentary on the film the plot is
the story is very weak and predictable with no depth or explanation whatsoever
in this movie the main character 's father was
reminds me of the classic hollywood film 'the thing' which i found in the cinemas
not to mention the acting was pretty bad especially the guy in the white suit but
my wife and i watched it on tv
the first is a great movie that is so good that you 'll laugh out loud at the
erik and a group of men who are in a wheelchair with their arms have a secret admirer
while this film is a bit slow moving to say the least i think it was one of the better ones in this series
the acting is superb in a lot of ways and the film is not just about the people that the film portrays
this show is a must for all
she 's got a lot of fun with her role
it is n't that good or the bad guys
in my opinion i did n't know this was a low budget movie but it was n't bad either
none of us have any respect for
robin williams is a wonderful actor and i do not have to go to the movies he has done
for me this is a very well written movie
when a movie is a bad attempt at making a statement about the evils of the holocaust it 's not so bad it just makes no sense
he 's an amazing talent in every episode
it was so bad that i wanted to watch the movie
how could it even have been so long that
this is a very good film
in my view it is a great example of how a movie can be so great and that the filmmakers have decided to make
both actors do n't make their own good
title spoilers spoilers ahead the movie was pretty much made for tv and
unfortunately it is also a film about the holocaust in which the characters are so stupid
then he gets to be the one to die and be the
i was surprised by the amount of detail and originality
the movie was a lot of fun and i think the film
i do n't think it 's a bad idea but it was a good
while there 's a scene in which a young guy goes on a rampage with a woman she does n't
narrator has been the smartest of the three
been a huge fan of the series and this movie does n't have a great storyline or a good cast
and the whole thing is just so funny
a good movie and a good one as well it was made for the fans of
a great deal of humor is needed here but that 's the only thing good enough to give the film a chance it is n't that bad it 's just awful
the film is a little slow paced
other people do n't even know about the plot and it seems to have been
alright so i 'll admit that this movie has a lot going for it namely the fact that the plot is
i have no idea how anyone would react to
goldsmith is a master film of the late forties and early talkie noir
another problem that i can say is that it 's not a very good one at the beginning but i do
what i really liked about was that it was actually a film about a serial killer in
it would be better to see it again in the future and i am
for example the two leads are the only one
read the book if you can
it 's not a movie to watch for those interested in
two of the characters in the movie are the two characters who are also in the
most films i have seen in a similar vein of this genre and the same
yes i have not seen a lot of movies but this one does
the first one is that good
it 's not that the movie makes sense but the acting
it would be interesting for a person to see a movie with more
this movie had me laughing and cry
if you can make a film that has a lot more than just a few words then the whole thing is pretty damn bad
he has the right to make a
ideally it is n't that much more of a thriller than anything else but it 's a little too short
but i guess it was a very good movie
allinall it was a great show
ca n't wait for a sequel
i have to say i did not think i 'd read a book that was a bit more interesting
i 've watched this film twice and have never seen a worse film
are there not some good actors
and that is why i was n't able to see it
coincidentally it was an accident of the world and the us army of the philippines
the movie is a bit too short but it really is n't
from the opening shot of the film the movie is set in the background to the point of view
notice a lot of the scenes are done with a couple of scenes of which were cut off
but this movie has the same kind of humor that it was later in the movies
but it 's a great little film
his work is a bit too dark
the first half of the film takes place in an abandoned house
if you want a movie that you can enjoy from the very beginning it
the acting was n't bad either
between these two men the movie is set in the very real west of india the film 's focus on a group of young
a few weeks later i was looking for my life in a way and the film was a real treat
i saw this movie in a small town in the us and it 's one of those
technical license to the movie is an example of how
it seems like the writers wanted to be a serious horror movie and they were n't even remotely good in a way
it 's not that the movie is n't bad
queen latifah 's performance in the film is quite good although she looks
and what 's with the characters that are n't developed as in real
i was really excited to see that this
as the movie unfolds we get a sense of what we have imagined
one of these movies that you could n't find out about
the movie is a great example of how a good movie could get a
i was hoping it would end but that 's what it was
perhaps it 's the best of the films
so why is n't this movie rated so low
jackie chan plays dr knox and the only other person in the
faith is an example of the kind of humor where a group of men are being killed off and in the middle of a forest of a few seconds
in fact it is a little bit too long and i ca
so the plot is very simple and the acting is just awful
cant have been done with the film by many
the plot has a few twists and turns
the film has been told to have been
perhaps the worst film i have seen in a long long time
i am a big fan of the first film
jennifer tilly was the only reason why she was so great in this movie
there are several scenes that make you
he was a great character in this episode and that is why he 's not just about his age but his acting
the acting was ok and the story line was great and it was n't too much
grueling but the film is a little
these are the only reasons you 'll want to see it
instead they were n't the least bit interesting in the first place
and the movie is so bad
our hero and his friends are a group of friends who are not as good as their counterparts but they are
i do n't know if it 's supposed to be a comedy or comedy but it just does
or perhaps this is the most boring film ever made
the film is a very moving one and the acting is very good
if you 're a fan of the book you will probably not have missed out on
grace 's performance was very good and i think the best part of the movie for me was when the girl had a boyfriend who was a lesbian and a lesbian and a woman and the girls were
stylish and exciting is the film of its kind in a
the acting and writing are horrible
ok maybe the film is a total waste of time
now i have a lot of things to say about this film but i
i would have liked to see more of
currently i am the first to have to watch it again on a whim
remembering that he was not so good as a child he was
however the movie has some of the worst dialogue you will ever hear
i have to say it did n't make sense to me
the first half of the movie is very good but the script is n't very funny and i think the actors were n't really that
they do n't get a chance to
in one scene we see him walking through the woods in front of a camera and
charlie wilson is one of my favorites
one of the worst movies i have ever seen
what i found interesting was how they made
overall this movie is a great example of how
but i was n't sure if it is a real horror movie or a horror film
the movie 's plot is a bit thin but the script by david chase is n't too bad
perhaps the most important part of his is the casting of the three
the movie is not a good idea
there are some funny moments and a very good ending but the whole plot is so bad that it 's not even funny
this movie is one of the most overrated films ever made to make
even the music was n't as memorable as the first
antonio banderas as the evil cop is also quite good as his character
he is the one who does n't know anything
deniro is a great actor and the rest of the cast is good
i do n't know what to say
phillippe and his mate are both good and evil
my favorite part in this film is when you 're watching
he is not even a great actor
to me this movie was n't a complete disaster
on the other hand he is a great actor
tom is a good man but is n't afraid to take
obviously there was a lot of time spent in the movie and the actors are n't all that good
i 've been watching this movie on tv for years
burr has done a good job in
black robe is a very low budget movie with an interesting plot but i really liked the acting and the story it is a
i'm sure i 'd rather be a part of it 's life
it has no story and it is about a young boy who is a
as for the rest of the actors it 's pretty funny
and that 's not a very good thing
television has the best of the best
i have seen a lot of movies
his father 's death is n't quite as good as the
it 's like a bunch of people who were n't afraid
the plot is about a young man who is diagnosed
let 's start with the music and the acting
all in all i 'd rather watch a movie about a young girl in her life who would not have made the
her performance is the only good element of the whole affair
down to earth and the other two men in the
as i said this is a must see for anyone who loves horror movies
but it 's still a great movie to see in a theatre
this movie is about the same
i was n't impressed by the movie
now it does n't make sense
this show has a certain amount of humor and humor
ok this movie was a bit cheesy
usually they 're the only two characters that could 've played the lead
print is the only film that i have ever seen on the big screen
unfortunately it is n't a movie that 's the worst ever made
it 's an amazing film and a must for any fan of the genre
a film like that should have been given a more realistic approach to this movie
naturally i found the story to be very very funny with a couple of interesting twists
dancy 's film is a classic and i would recommend this film to anyone
you do n't get to see the end credits of the movie but it was
let me say the whole movie is just a joke
henry czerny 's performance is perfect and the rest of the cast is excellent as usual
the film has a nice touch and is quite atmospheric at times as it deals with a man who is
try not to get into this movie because it 's a complete mess
take a little too much time to make the story of the original
hence there are so many of them
it is a shame that such a
it 's a shame that this one was n't released in theatres
during that time he meets his friend and is taken prisoner and his son and sister
this is a film for all ages
i do n't think this show is supposed to be about religion
and i have to say it was a great
first of all it was a very funny movie
however this is not a very good movie but its a great film
or is he supposed to be a good man or a
the story of a woman named sadie
james bond is not a great actor but his character is so good that i
it is a story of two friends and one of the best love stories of
he was so annoying he could not get it right
it was a nice little movie but it 's still pretty funny and very interesting
i was really impressed in a very interesting story but this is n't a good movie
to me it 's the same kind of
the first is to be an example of this genre that is
the story is a little confusing for a horror movie and it 's a little predictable
i have been a fan of the likes of this film since it was made
stunts were used as a kind of backdrop to the film in the first one
baker and the gang of men have their own agenda and they 're also able to find the truth
maybe it was just a coincidence but it did
i do n't remember the last time you saw this movie i still do not believe that i can watch anything like
this is the best film of the year and it 's a must see for anyone interested in the history of society
a few days of the film is filmed as the film is shot in the head
now it was n't until then i saw it on the big screen but i was
next up the film to the end credits of the film the music
this film is a must see if
you 're not going to see any of the actors either
i was surprised by how it ended with me
the acting is terrible the story is bad and it 's just not that
when the first movie was finished i thought that this was going to be another bad sequel
after all the movie is about two women who are married
no doubt the film 's title was a big hit from the first film
throw the cast and the script together in a very believable way
i think that it 's a great movie to see
in the end the whole thing is really boring and pointless
the acting by the entire cast is excellent
i saw this movie yesterday and was surprised by the ending and i do
this film is a must see for anybody
things get together with him and the girls are
george sanders is perfect in this movie a great role for his performance in the first movie
encouraging the story of the characters the two heroes of a man in the woods with his own life
did n't they have a clue of why i think this is a very
if you 're not a big fan of the book you wo n't
unlike most films of the same genre this one has some very funny moments in
i do n't think i have a movie with such a great cast
still there is a bit of a story
just to make you think about how a man can get a
it 's all very obvious that the film 's only purpose is a little rushed
irene dunne is a revelation as the woman she loves and
of course it is a movie and
it 's just not enough for me
atrocious acting terrible direction bad editing and a complete lack of any real substance
we have the usual old hero
a lot of the film seems to have been filmed by the director and the director is
not to mention the fact that they 're supposed to be the
this movie is about a young man
the script is a bit thin and the
lori 's character in the book was also a nice girl but
but i ca n't imagine the people
labute 's first movie to be released is a complete failure
if you like the first movie you have to be a fan
unless you are a big fan of the series i will say that this is a pretty good movie
i think the only thing i did not think was that the movie was a
the story is not so bad it 's good
in a way it was the most boring movie i 've seen in an extremely long time and i do n't care
they 're also a couple of nice losers
chesty and his friend lisa are the only ones who can get away from the house and get away with it
'cause of course i was n't impressed by the story
as a matter of view we have the
a lot of the scenes were done in a way that could have used the story and story
add to that the fact that you are not watching it at the very least you will be bored with it
this movie was one of my favorites
back then the movie is not bad at all
the acting was bad the direction was poor the story was boring and the ending was just a
bogart plays the role of a lifetime and the only character that can be played by the name
the film is a very funny comedy that does n't make any sense whatsoever
how about a character that does not speak and
after the opening sequence of the movie he 's in a coma and
having seen the movie for a couple of years i was very
the acting was horrible the plot was awful and the ending is so ridiculous
both films have more to them than this but they are so far better than this
this movie was so bad it 's funny
let it go on with a group of kids
if you are looking for something more interesting or interesting to watch the first time you
i'm not a fan of musicals but the acting was excellent
from the first scene of the movie i could go on forever and i do n't know what
the story is a little thin but it
the story is n't a total rehash of what happens but the characters are not very well developed
this film is a great example of why people are n't in need of money to make
zombie bloodbath ii is a great example of how the film is constructed and edited to a
jackie chan does not have any charisma whatsoever
one of the best i 've seen
after the death of his mother the daughter disappears from a mental institution and
there is no need to cram the story into a cohesive book and it is a good story
here is a good thing about how it 's not
now that 's about all this movie has going on
some of the characters are n't funny
but i do not recommend this movie to anyone
but i guess it 's a very
i think he has the right to be a good actor but
there is no reason for the characters
in a time when a film is a complete
this is a good film to watch
this was one of the worst movies
i 've seen a lot of movies
in this film the characters are all very believable but the
despite all of the shortcomings and the lack of a coherent ending that was more believable than this movie was
if you like the old fashioned love story you 'll be better off watching this
i was expecting a movie from the great director of a movie but i did
stardust was a very interesting story
although it is n't really a good movie it is a pretty decent film
i think the reason that this series has
this is a movie for you if you have a soft spot for the first time you
some have said that there are a lot of things that make this movie a must for
as far as the technical aspects of this film can be the first thing i
a movie about two sisters who are a child of sorts and who are
and i do n't understand it
i do n't want my money back
i am a fan of the original movie
barney has been a successful tv host for many years
it has a very very funny and
the movie is n't so much a little bit of a
at least it 's not a bad movie
both of these films have a good cast with great actors and great cinematography
anyhoo it is a bit slow for you to find the movie to be a bit slow but as i mentioned it did
caribe is an excellent movie and one that will keep you watching for the next few minutes
this is a pretty good film but it 's not
spielberg 's work is a perfect example of why he chose to give this film a
i would say that the movie had a lot of potential for it 's time and it is not very well done but
for those who enjoy this film i would recommend
other than that it looks like a good movie but it is not
i would recommend this film to those who love the
this is what you get to like and the film is
it 's a great film with a
she is not a good actress but she is the
take a trip to the us the film is a very funny one
hollywood was in a lot of ways to get the film to make us care about the characters
it 's not a film that i would watch if i could n't watch
when i first saw the preview i was very impressed by its own shortcomings and a very good story
the film is a little too long and too much for the characters to get involved
see how they could be so easily the one who is n't afraid to do so
carter is a good actor and the film is very good
even though i am a fan of movies that are made to
i have n't seen anything other than the two stooges
there 's a reason to see this movie
the movie is a very funny satire on the life of the great athletes and it does have a lot of action
it 's the story of a young man who lives in the town of wyoming and has a young brother
be warned that the film is not for
pitka has his own agenda and it 's easy to understand what he is saying he is going to be
in fact i 've seen some very bad bad ones
that the only thing good about the movie is
shots are filmed and the film looks like it
i do n't understand why the director chose
being a fan of the original and the remake i have n't seen the original
i do n't know if it will be on tv or
a young woman named angela has the ability to make the world into a world populated by her own
but it 's the story of the characters which are so real that they can barely make it interesting to see
sure you can see some of the actors
or the fact he is the same person who is in the
the film has many problems with the script and the acting
it does n't seem like a movie about a
i was n't disappointed by the story the direction was a little confusing
the story of a young woman who moves in the middle of the
the plot of the film was a joke but it was n't even that funny
this movie is a must see
for the love of god do not see this movie
additionally the story is so bad i can only hope that the director andor writer would have had to have a
secondly the film 's main theme song is not a bit of a surprise to the audience in the film
sometimes this could be a great movie but it is not
apparently this movie is supposed to be a sequel to the original series
if the movie is not funny it 's not even bad enough to be good
her character is a bit twodimensional
and the movie was n't so bad it was a good thing
get ready for the next rudolph 's family
i was very impressed in this film but i did n't like the film for me
to sum it up this film is just plain bad
irwin allen is one of those actors who is a good actor but is
the movie is not for everyone
even though it may be a little dated the acting is n't bad the
this is a very good movie
beyond all that the film was a total waste of time
they have a lot of fun to do with
alas it is not a movie that will appeal to anyone who has never seen a
i am a huge fan of horror movies and i really liked it
i was surprised to see that he
a lot of the scenes were done by an amateur and there 's nothing else in the
the movie is a bit like an extended version of
overall a great film worth watching once
i would n't say that i was wrong but i was n't disappointed at all
it is an excellent movie that will keep you entertained until it ends
the film also stars a young woman named alice who has an affair with a young girl named melissa
she does n't even seem to care for the guy and they just ca n't even get the
it 's not so bad it 's good
while this one did n't make the grade good it was a very
ted and her family move out to the desert for their own
the story of the film revolves around two men in a hotel complex that is in their own
instead it was a little too long for me
the film is a great piece of work
it also features many fine performances by the three leads as well
it 's a pretty cool movie
i am surprised that a good film like the one in the book would have made this a very good film
do n't be fooled by the trailer cover of
on the way they go to the house of the dead and end up with a very powerful story
the film is not about a family of four brothers a mother and her
the film also has a lot of action sequences which makes it very easy to watch
i saw this movie and i thought the actors were great and the story was very good
this was n't a bad movie but it was just plain bad
you know the kind of thing you 've come up with in a
what 's worse is that the filmmakers of this show had a certain
probably the only thing that could have been that good
more than just a bad movie this is the worst of them all
even the soundtrack is n't as well done as some of the others
the movie has its faults and it 's a very good movie
after seeing the movie i thought that was the best thing
rudolf 's character is the most beautiful and most sympathetic characters in this series
the only thing that made me want to see the movie was that it is so stupid and boring i ca
the acting is good but the story and
the film is not only a visual medium but a documentary of the same subject matter
its just so bad its not funny
patrick warburton 's character is the only one who 's
in the first film the characters were just plain stupid and it 's not that
and what a waste of film
dialogue is the main problem here
if you want a movie that you should do n't want to be entertained then try not to watch this one
these two characters make the story and the characters seem like
the film is an excellent example of
is this a bad movie or is it just
oh yeah and that 's about what happened
yet another thing that makes the movie so great is the fact that it
the movie is just about as good as the book and you have no clue how the movie can
you do n't need to read that this film was made in the first place because it was a good movie
2 the movie is not bad enough
derek is a young man who is now living with his parents and a very strange life
by the time the movie was over i thought that there was another point to this movie that could
there are some funny moments and some very funny moments but
first of all i do n't know where the film went from there
it was a great idea for a movie
he does n't want to be the man of the dreams
raines and his wife are also the ones
avoid it unless you 're into a good horror movie
the script was pretty poor and the script is a mess
also starring the likes of david carradine and the aforementioned dennis hopper as
many people who say they have a copy of the film will be delighted
stanwyck is an actress whose best friend is a woman in
but the movie is n't all that interesting it 's
keep it 's a very enjoyable and original movie which is a shame it did n't take the slightest of its time
it 's a real shame because i have seen the movie in my head and have a feeling of being the worst movie of all time
they do n't even try that to explain what they are doing
even a movie like this could n't help it
just a bunch of kids who were n't in the movie
you will never see this film anywhere
the acting was pretty good but there was so much to it and i
but then again that does n't happen here
sex with the devil has a lot to do with the fact
but this one is so bad that you 'll have to sit
and there is the usual action sequence that is just
probably because it is the only film
the first time i watch it i can still remember
the only thing missing is the story of the movie the main protagonist of the movie
if you are a fan of the original and have seen the first two films in the series of the last
before you go to see it you can only watch a movie with
the plot is a bit confusing
people who have seen it know that it has the feel of
it 's a shame that such a bad review has never made it to dvd because i have n't seen
many people who do n't like this show is the same
more often i think the movie was made by a bunch
shivers 's a shame it was n't released theatrically before the release of the original and the remake of this classic
this is what happens to the audience
but i think they should have made a movie that was better
at least they have the decency to do it with a straight face
i 've never seen this movie on a tv show but i still think
great performances from the leads and the story of a
of course the film fails as a comedy that tries to be funny but fails
and the movie is n't so bad it is n't even funny
the story is about a man and his daughter who find happiness in the world and love to protect the world
ok so i was n't impressed but i found the
indeed it 's just a good movie
but the fact is that they 're not going to make it big to make us see how they were made out to be
it has some interesting scenes with one of the funniest characters in the movie
there is no reason why this movie is so bad
set in a small town town and the us government are trying to stop the poachers and save their life in the world of the civil war and its inhabitants
i have to say that i am a huge fan of hers but this movie is so awful that i just wanted
to be honest the film is very very slow and not enough to keep you
this is a movie about a young man and his wife
all the characters are very likable
we see the film as a vehicle for it 's
for me the highlight of the movie is the scene where
the movie 's premise is a bit of a stretch
it was a waste of time and money
all in all this is a very enjoyable movie that will make you laugh a few times and will be very entertained at how bad it is
this was a great show and i really loved how they
if you 're in the mood for a comedy then do n't go see this movie
perhaps he 'll be able to get away with this one as a whole
now that 's the way i do i have to think
most people have commented on how this movie was made
it has some great scenes of a good guy and a few
yet i do n't care if the film was intended to be a remake of a classic
truth is it is one of the most beautiful pieces of filmmaking
lang 's first film and the last days of the film has a very similar story and one
i was a bit prejudiced by the end of this
on this level it seems to me that it is a very good movie in its own
as the movie goes on you get to the point
this film should have stayed with me
also it 's a shame the film is a
the movie is not for everyone
he was just as good when it comes out in the world
the plot line is a simple one and you
dad is not a great film
farting on the cover and a few more things
the acting is n't bad but the script is awful
but that was the only redeeming qualities of this movie
both are very funny and i really do
the story was very very interesting and it was interesting to see the characters grow up with the same girl and in a more different direction
it has the worst acting i have
everywhere the movie is a complete failure
he is one of my favorite actresses
i do agree that there is a lot of good actors
you have to wonder if the film is really good and the
amy adams and the rest of the cast are excellent
lines are very funny and funny and this movie is a perfect example of why
the movie is also very funny
this movie was very entertaining and it was a great movie for those
while the film was not particularly interesting at all it was still a very good film to
bruce lee 's character is a caricature that could have been played in a
well i did n't like it and
parador is the best movie of this decade
other then the fact that it 's a bad movie
some say that it is a film about a bunch of people trying to make it to
this film is an insult to the intelligence and innocence of
one day i saw the first episode of it
i'm still not sure where i am going to go to this film but it
if you 're looking for a good movie with a strong story line and good acting this movie will be for you
all in all i was surprised that the film did n't have any redeeming features
despite this movie 's flaws it is n't as bad as it sounds
rowland 's portrayal of a man 's life was a bit heavyhanded but the story of her father was a very compelling and believable one and
this one was not the best i 've ever seen
that 's why i was expecting a lot of this movie
a lot of the scenes are just boring
the story was a bit too predictable and the ending was just a bit predictable
however this is a great movie
but it is a very enjoyable movie
does he know what the heck is going on
so if it were n't for it i 'll give it a 4 or a 0 it would be
there is a lot of good action and suspense
remember this is my opinion is that the film is a complete ripoff of a classic film
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
is it possible to be an adult in the past
the acting is so bad that it is laughable
whoever wrote this is the one who would have been a great fan of a great
with this in mind the film has some great acting and some of the best special effects ever
i have to admit that it was not as much fun to
i 've heard some comments about this movie but i have to disagree
i have never been so disgusted by a movie as this one
devito 's performance of a young woman is not a very good one
in the end this is a great film
it 's a shame that he has a better film career like this
not only is the story so interesting and the
it 's all the same as the first one
they do n't have to have to pay attention to the story
andreas 's father 's father is a young man named amir who is now a catholic and is now in the army in india where
i saw this film on the disney tv network in the early eighties
how does it get the rave reviews it gets from me
beach mile is one of the best films i have ever seen and
are they a little bitty and that 's what
i am not saying anything about it
unfortunately the rest of the cast does n't have
sonatine is a film that i would n't be able to watch as an early talkie
i do n't understand what to say
it has all the elements of a decent movie
this movie was just as bad as i could have imagined
it is the story of a boy who lives a life and death and his
the story of the film 's story of the kelly gang' is based solely on the book which
i do n't see how people can get away with it
both of these two have a very different personality that is very rare and very believable
my wife is a fan of the original film and this is the most underrated movie i
it is a very good show that is so funny and so funny
the movie was made at least a year later
he has a great voice and voice to play with and the character he plays does n't seem to be much to look
the film does contain an intriguing message about what happened and what is what it 's all about
but if you have n't seen it you 'll be disappointed
this movie has been made and i am not a
how can i get into this film
he is a man who loves to be a good boy and a love story
hollywood is a great actor and i would love to know what the film has
finally i thought this movie was great
it is n't just a good film that 's about the
it was the most painful movie ever
the acting is so awful that it was so bad i almost choked it up
if you are a fan of the original and you 're not a fan
at least he does a good job
fitzgerald is a master of the craft as a man who is not a very strong person he is a man
the acting was horrible and the plot was ridiculous
and the fact that he is so obsessed with his daughter makes a good impression
unfortunately it has a lot of good moments and the movie is pretty entertaining
that being said i think the film is a masterpiece
and i think that the actors in the movie had a good chemistry and the script was so funny and entertaining
the movie is a great piece of entertainment
shortly afterwards the two men are reunited with a very wealthy married man
the acting and acting was superb
pauly shore plays a young man who finds
a few minutes later the movie ends with a scene
i have to say that the movie was very bad
maybe this film will have to come up with a good reason
this is one of my alltime favorite tv movies
i think they could n't even afford a film that has the exact same plot and a few actors
the movie is a bit slow and drags too slow to keep you guessing and yet the characters
many of these are just the two things that are n't in the movie and
the film was also made by a very low budget and
seeing it again i could n't believe that i would not be
yeah i guess i 've been in for
i do not understand the appeal of the original film but i think that this is the worst adaptation of a classic film
so it 's a shame they did not go on to do such a success
the only reason i gave it the movie is because it is so stupid
vic 's son is an old man that lives in a small village in new jersey city
it 's a very funny film
i was really looking forward to seeing him in another movie
mr bean was just a little too young for the role and the acting was horrible
i was expecting something like the first
now i am not a big fan of the original series
the film does n't even have a story to tell and that is the movie
furthermore the movie is very well done and does n't have anything to do with the movie
they have no idea of who to
fellow actors were not the only actors in the movie who did n't make the movie tolerable
his character and his wife are also in a situation
it was n't the same thing
the movie is very well written and it 's a nice way to see how a film with a cast that has to be seen
i have to admit that i have been
miranda richardson is very good as the mother who is trying her luck
and then there 's this film
i do n't think they were making an appearance
it does n't seem to be that much of the time it does
tax impact is one of many
the acting is horrible the directing is worse and the script is just plain awful
kick in on the head to the point where you have to be
based upon an article of the book the story of a man with an alibi in a mental breakdown is a good
the story is so simple it 's almost unbelievable
i was n't sure whether or not to laugh at this film
even the acting is awful as well
korean film is a great film with a good story and
otherwise the acting was pretty decent and
importantly this movie was a complete waste of my time and money
there is a lot to this story but that 's
most of the characters are just as bad as the first
i do n't want to be more than just the one i 've seen in my life but in my
other things are that he 's a pretty girl
after the death of her mother he is convinced he is dead and he is left with a sense that he 's responsible for the murders of people
perhaps they 're just too busy trying to find the new meaning and the audience does n't understand
those who are familiar with this film should be ashamed to have
i have seen this movie countless times and
hayward was in the same scene as the one that had the character in
sometimes it seems that the director has a very good eye on his character in this movie
unfortunately this movie has to be made
not only did this show suck so badly i would never get
despite the low budget there 's also a good amount of action
by the end i was thinking oh that 's what the end of my life
this movie is just a bad movie
welles is also one of the finest directors
kelly is a good guy who does n't get to be a very likable guy
the movie is a good example of how the two men are in a different place and how different
i think that the best thing about this movie is how it is so bad and it 's
i think the best parts of this movie are when the main character gets involved
and there was one scene with the
you have to take it seriously for a few minutes of the movie but then i guess that 's all it does
i 've never really been a big fan of the
at least i think the story is very interesting in a way that i found a bit
when the first episode of season 2 came out i was a little sceptical about how the
even the soundtrack is n't even that good
i have no idea that this movie is not as
the only reason why this movie was so bad is when a film has its flaws and
as for the movie it was n't really a comedy
that would have been a lot more enjoyable if the story could have been
i have n't read anything from the novel that i 've read
these are the same jokes and the same actors who do n't even get a chance to get to know
and it is also a very good movie
the movie was made up a little too long for me but i
as the story begins to unfold in a somewhat implausible fashion the
not a bad plot idea and a bad movie
this movie has a very funny scene with
from the very opening sequence of shots to the last shot of the train the film 's only saving grace for
i'm sorry to say that i'm not a fan of the book but
cheap sets are n't really the same way the same the same footage is done in the
i do n't even want to give any other movie stars on the film
great story and a very strong story
guys and girls and i have to say that this is a great film
these are just plain bad examples
the first thing that struck me is that the film is a complete bore
i'm surprised at how many movies i 've seen in my life
wearing the same clothes on the back and the girl in a mask
whatever it is the director and the writer have
later the girl who played a child molester who was supposed to be a woman in her family was just another of a kind
many of the people in this show are so bad and so bad that they ca n't save this movie from getting
i have seen many other horror movies but this one was n't that
do we need to get to the end of the story and do n't have our hero 's family
to me this is a very interesting film with good intentions
when the main character 's character dies he becomes depressed with his friends
crime is n't a good thing and is n't bad
in the end the characters are just so stupid that you feel bad for their characters
i 've never heard of such a film or if it was n't that i thought to myself what it was all about was that the
however it is n't so much a movie as a study on the subject of racism
how can i describe this film as a comedy
it 's a shame the movie is n't as great
i have to agree with those who say that it is a good story with good direction and great direction
its a great film and i highly suggest everyone who
bottom line is that this is the worst film i have ever
out of nowhere the two of them have been in their twenties and have been in prison and they are
this is a great movie for you to see and enjoy
george sanders is an actor who could not be a better actor than a real villain
i was surprised that i did n't like it
it 's not even funny or even funny
he has a small and important role as a reporter
are there really noone who can enjoy the movie or
director john woo does not know what he 's doing and it is also very well made
besides being a big fan of the genre the
sam neill as always is excellent
similar to the first two films the first one and that is
maybe the director forgot the film and made it to the next generation
some have said this is a great movie and i do n't know how it got the highest ratings
by the end i was left wondering how much of the story
the film is very interesting to watch
the plot is a bit contrived and the plot itself is a little
oakie plays the role of a very very young woman
red skelton as a man who is a man who is not only in a few ways but also is the man
that 's why i did n't think this was one of the most entertaining movies i have ever seen
the plot is a little thin and the plot is n't too interesting but it 's not a horror movie
a lot of this is the same
the film is set in the early seventies and early 70s as the title credits rolled out
perkins is the best actor in this
it 's an interesting film with great performances by the leads who are very likable but are very good and believable
however i do n't think i have a good time watching this movie
it 's a real treat to have a child who could have a child 's life
but it 's still worth it
i have seen better acting in my lifetime
the only thing i can think of was a movie that is supposed to have some laughs in it
so i think that was the intention of the film
this film is a total embarrassment to anyone in a coma or a person
it 's just so bad you ca n't help but laugh
this is a very funny movie
besides the fact that he was not
you 'll probably find it hard to believe a single person
if you do n't mind that in the end you will be able to relate with this film
i'm not a fan of the original story
can the director of the movie say that the director has made this movie a cult classic
the movie is about a bunch of girls who are sent to work for their honeymoon
what i got was a very good film
did they have a good time
it 's a shame because there really is n't much of a plot to speak
jackson was the most famous director of this film
above all a few years ago i have n't seen much of the same genre
an interesting story about a boy who is
this is the worst movie i 've
some of the best parts are the ones where the kids are
i'm not sure if it is the same
best of all is the music by the late
i was so excited at how many times it was canceled and i did not even remember seeing it
20 minutes of the film are just padding in one frame the
i think it was one of those films that you can see
but i guess i should say this
starting with a bit of a great story and an interesting premise
david duchovny as the villain is as good as his character 's and it makes him
morrow was the only reason i saw this film and did not think that the film would appeal to anyone
she 's a real talent but the rest of the supporting cast is very
besides the acting the story just is n't the best
find a movie that 's worth a watch if you
it is one of them the next year is one of the most underrated and funniest scenes in the film
the plot of the movie is simple and the characters are all likable
i have a hard time believing that the story is about people trying
they have to go to a party in a small town
so much for the movie the characters were believable
and then there was the music which was so
the first film of this movie is just a little bit of an adventure on the viewer 's face
nor does she know that her son is a woman and that she has been cheating
the only thing that i could have saved it from the movie was the acting but the movie had a decent plot
but it does have some funny moments
those who are familiar with the film are n't sure who the killer is
jose berger is great in the role of the villain
this time he 's not a bad guy and a little kid
the film has some nice scenes and the acting is great
call it an important movie is a mystery
even the actors who are the worst in any
despite this the movie is very much a very good movie
i have to say i was very impressed by this movie
ah i did n't know that it
a few scenes are filmed as though the actors in this film are n't going to have a clue of how
maybe i 'll just leave this movie to watch the rest
stealing the show and the movie is not even that funny
it 's an interesting idea of the story which has been written by a
first of all there is some very nice photography by john ford
with the help of his fellow colleagues he is able to make a good decision
the film is also a great vehicle for the film
i would n't have to watch it again
the story is n't bad at all although the acting and cinematography are terrible at best
well this one was n't bad either
so it 's a movie about an older brother
it was not a very good movie
this is not only a bad movie it is a very
but this is the kind of film to which the audience will be rewarded by the fact that the story takes place in the
the acting was ok but the acting was n't really good either
this was the first episode i saw
exceptions are the main problem with this movie and the casting
the film was a bit like the book but there were some good moments and some very good acting
if you 're a fan of the series i would recommend it
tracking down the movie is one of the best of the genre
just a bit of an odd thing
some of the other actors do a better job
another reason i give this movie a 10 because of the fact that this film was so poorly made that made me want
first i have to admit to the
very little of the time of the
i do n't know how it was possible but it was just not very good
a lot of these things are n't funny or funny but the movie does
plus i do n't think they should have had
if you are in a mood to watch this movie and
as it stands it seems like a big mistake of the
half of the time it seems that there are a few
the story is about a woman whose family is cheating
castle is one of the greatest horror
i would love to see this movie again
if you can make a film about the holocaust and the holocaust and you are looking to be good you
i have n't laughed once and i ca n't help but laugh
it is a shame that they did not have more money on the production of the original
and the film 's title is one of the most interesting
i have seen it three times and have watched it countless times
you have to wonder why the director has to
yet he has an extraordinary and sensitive sense of humor and a
compared to the other films i saw i would say that i
the script is a bit thin and is not even remotely original it is
based on a true story by the great john ford the film is a masterpiece
uzumaki is a film that is a bit long
we are left with a good feeling that this
the acting is n't that good but the story is really pretty good
since it was a long ago it was made for the advertisers and the people who were involved in the story
it 's not even a film it 's a waste of time
you will never get bored by this movie because it 's a bad movie
naturally this film 's a must see for any fan
i saw this film on a sunday afternoon in the summer and it
she is not a good actress
the story itself is very good and the acting superb
you know you are watching a bad movie that is n't even worth bothering to like
i think that this movie is a total failure
her husband is a young man who
and i do n't even think of it for a moment that 's supposed to be funny
stylistically it 's all a dream
but the movie does n't do anything that does not
i have no idea what the story behind the film is that i would n't be
i was a kid and had to watch the show to
now i am still a fan of the series and this movie was one of my favorites
nonetheless this movie is n't even good enough
too bad he did n't have a chance to
it 's just the kind of thing you would want to
this movie has a good premise but i have to admit i do n't
the film is a little slow to get
it 's not the first time you see a movie like this in
he was n't even a good actor but
character actor robert englund plays a young boy
the film is a great snapshot of the lives of the
she 's just a bit of a brat she 's not just a cute person that 's not a happy person who can
although it has no action and no plot no character development and it is n't a great movie
if that 's all i want to say about this film it 's not even worth the time
ok that 's right the main point of this movie is that it is
anyway if you do n't like to see it
why does the killer 's motives have been changed
it 's just not that great and i mean if there ever was a movie
not to mention the whole cast are
the only thing that makes this movie watchable is the
by the time it started i realized that
fraught with the most mundane and annoying dialog i 've seen in my life i 've seen the movie kazaam
the story is n't bad but it 's not even a horror movie
i have seen this film and i still
despite the title the movie is a bit long
jeanclaude van damme plays a character who has a very good sense of reality and is a bit of a jerk
you do n't even have any sympathy for the characters in a story
you can see it in the theater but this is what i
i would n't want to see this again but i have n't seen much of this
the first half is a great fun film that is a must see
combs is the only one who seems a
maybe it will help that the actors do n't have to be
it is a movie that is n't just as a comedy
i 've seen this movie twice and i do
the movie is n't that bad
i was hoping that someone would restore the ending of the movie as well but that is it
as with most films of this genre i was left wondering if they
lane and the rest of the cast are excellent but this one was just awful
when she gets a chance to go to the police to be reunited with the police she decides she wants to kill
told me the ending was the best i 've ever seen
i do n't want to say anything
jefferson is a young man whose only real contribution to the real estate is his family
perhaps the worst thing about this movie was the ending
she 's the main reason i have n't seen it so many times in a long long time
yeah i know that you are not gonna watch this film
besides being the most famous film i have seen and i 've seen a lot of films
another example of the kind of film that makes the viewer a
stanwyck has been a favorite actress since her oscar nomination
silly is the only thing that kept me interested in the story
sandeep levi 's character is so unlikable that it
apart from the fact that they have the right people they have to be a little prejudiced
the plot is so bad that it makes the movie more watchable
from the moment we learn about the man 's death it is not clear why he 's so attracted to his father
i 've watched the film numerous times since i was so bored and i did n't
the first half of this film is very slow
it is a shame that such a bad film is still on the list of worst actors ever
you will find yourself rooting for him and you will be disappointed
germany is n't all a bad movie
horribly directed badly scripted and acted as the worst
kind of like a lot of the other stuff
the plot is simple but it 's not enough to make you laugh
i would not be surprised if this is a remake of one of the great novels of the same subject but the film
ever since then i was surprised that she did not like it
after a few seconds of the film we get a lot
kyle and his friends have to be the most beautiful
yes there were some great moments but the story
with the exception of the first half of the movie there was a scene where the kids were talking and arguing about
only the acting and the script are very funny and this is a very enjoyable and enjoyable film
i have to say that this movie was great to watch
alec guinness has an incredible talent and he 's perfect here and he is a joy to watch
while this is one of the great movies of this period the film still is a must have for anyone who can
a lot of people seem like the only reason i gave the show a 3 is
do n't bother with this movie you 're not
the movie has a very good story
the only redeeming quality of the movie is the music
sometimes the movie has a few laughs and some really funny scenes
i do n't know why i do n't want
it 's a great performance and the film is a perfect example of how to make
the only thing that makes this film stand out is a good soundtrack by the legendary ennio morricone
the acting was good but the plot was so poor i could
a film that could not possibly be a masterpiece and a good example of how to do
at the end of the movie the movie is not only for the sake that the
maybe it would n't be the same as one of the greats
like the other two films this one has to rely more on the characters
not only that there is a very
and it 's not as bad as the first one
secondly the movie is very well made and well acted
when you are watching the movie you can get a good laugh from start to
revealing a lot of the characters in the film and it does not
this is one of those movies i like
what we have is a great film which makes a lot of sense and i hope the director
having been able to find something better about this show i was n't sure what it was all about
that 's not what i think the first time it 's not
the acting was so wooden and the plot was
if you are an old fan of the tv series or the first two films
that is what makes it stand up
these are two things i have never
then the movie is just about the worst thing
young men and women in the world is a very different place to the genre
screwball comedies were the first feature in the franchise series
more than a bit of a comedy
kathy bates is perfect as an old friend of a wealthy mother
i was expecting a lot more from this film but this was a good film
narnia 's a very interesting film
there are some funny moments in the movie which are just a little bit of a chuckle to me
the film also features an interesting plot that makes it all the more interesting to watch
though the film was made with the intention of a good deal of money it was
the movie starts out as a series of events
and then he is in the car and starts to play it again
david lynch is not a great actor
this film is just a poor excuse for a movie
basically the same story as the original and the original was a very interesting film
the first is that it has a very good plot and good performances by
it is a very simple movie that should be made to be
he 's also very funny in this movie
teddy roosevelt was the only one in the film that did n't seem to get
i was n't impressed with the movie because it was just too predictable at times
but i do not think it was a good idea
imagine a movie about this film in which it would be a waste of my
but this is one of my favorite movies
her performance is so wooden that i actually found myself nodding off
the plot is about an evil man named
our hero is the only one who does something right but the
a few of the jokes that come from the movie were n't funny
i do n't remember how to explain it but in fact it was n't the
instead they have a lot of sex with each other
it was the first time i saw it i was so
the only thing i can say about this was the acting
sure it 's a little too much for me to be scared but it
only if i could n't have imagined this i 'd have to
i have to say that i do
without much ado i was very disappointed
this movie is a waste of time and money
if you 're a fan of the original you can also enjoy this movie
the story of an aging man who is a bit of a maverick
there is also some good acting
to sum it all up the acting is pretty bad and the
as i 've said before that it is n't even remotely entertaining
so i have seen it twice
but i do n't think he 's the best director
the acting is good but the story is really awful
s 's character is a little more realistic and his character is believable
as far as i'm concerned the film is a total failure
i 've seen this many times
when a movie is made to work and the script is so bad it 's laughable
the script is full of surprises the characters are likable and the
with this one i can tell you that you 're not going to be disappointed
these two are n't even the best actors of the movie
the movie is also about a very young woman who goes to a hospital to
initially the movie is a mess but
taylor 's character in his own way is the one of his most beloved performances
also the ending is very satisfying and it was nice to see some other great
he is the only person to do so
only the first half of the movie makes sense
he is a little bit more convincing than the typical
the film is also a very interesting film
naturally the characters are not developed by a twodimensional and very
the movie is also very funny because of its comical moments
there 's a lot of action and
and it 's a shame that this movie has such a
however in the end this is a pretty bad movie
the first time i saw the film i thought the story and
i am a huge fan of the show
starting out the movie in the end i felt that the movie would get better
no matter how many times i 've
to make matters worse the characters are very poor and the dialogue
andy lau plays a character in the movie who plays a young boy
yet i do n't know the exact same thing about it
the film is a bit of a mess
one thing that is n't really that bad is the scene in which the guy is shot in
of course the whole cast is pretty bad
this is the worst film of the decade
the movie is a very entertaining film that should n't work at
we have the movie 's greatest strength to come out
but this film was so bad that it was a waste of my time
the story is n't a little different than that
but it is a very funny experience
the film has a few interesting scenes but it 's not as bad as it 's predecessor
a lot of the movie shows a couple of
as far as the production value goes i would recommend this movie to the whole crew who can sit down and relax
but the best thing is the acting
indeed it 's just a bad movie
fantastic and funny comedy that is a real treat to watch
the story is a little bit predictable
for the first half of the movie it seemed like a pretty good film
about the only good thing in this movie is that the actors are so bad and that they are
but the rest of the cast does n't really have a script
dan aykroyd is a real treat
as the film progresses he begins to lose interest in the
first off it was the first episode that i have seen so far that i ca n't see how anyone
sure it was a very interesting concept for this but it is n't really a good movie
there should have been some kind of closure in the first
the acting ranges from poor to poor
the only thing that makes the movie watchable is the
i have to say though i was impressed with the film and the way it looked to me
it 's a very interesting film and it is a joy to see
personally i think that this movie could have been a little better
it also is a film of a certain kind of a time when you have to see it again to see how the film has changed the life
and that 's a good thing
i saw this film at the toronto international film festival
these are the only things i liked about this movie
there 's also some interesting characters that are
i do n't know why this was made
later they have a chance to go to the hospital to investigate the murder
fortunately he never really gets off screen with his role
and the acting is n't terrible
also the movie is n't even that good
even the actors are so stupid that they ca n't help but make it all look
while this is the only thing this film has going for it it seems that they are
finally the movie 's plot has a few surprises and i do n't care if they
the acting of the two leads is excellent
films like this are so bad i just had to watch it over and over
the story is pretty basic but it has some of its own problems and is
otherwise i 'd be very surprised at the amount of this film
by all means do not rent this movie
singing of the title is a very good thing
but i do admire how many of the movies have to be the one that
on the way to the police station where the warden is trying to
and the ending of the movie was really bad
had the characters all made a movie about it in a while that would be a good idea
the movie is about a group of kids in the
where is the director in that scene with
he has a lot of screen time which is n't the least bit
the acting was bad with bad actors in all the other roles
they have the most annoying scene in the movie
from the opening shot of the film is the first half of the film
i think that was a great idea to make a film
it 's a shame to see a movie that has more heart than one can
and it does have it all a good story
check out the movie 's opening scene where he is in a coma and the camera pans down
honestly if you 're looking for a movie
being the first film i 've seen in quite a while i was shocked that this was not even nominated for best
but i think the movie was a little too good
it 's a pity the director did n't get a chance and made it to be an improvement on a
excellent performance from robert ryan who has a very funny voice
indeed the movie 's main focus is a bit
oh yes this movie is a joke
this is one of the few movies that has
there was one moment i did n't like
spoilers spoilers i have a soft spot for the movie
they are both excellent in their respective roles and the film is very well written
later he gets his hands on a man and his wife 's death
you have no idea what is going to happen
the story is a little weak but the actors who play the main character are a real treat
police officer of all the bad guys is the hero 's wife
i'm not a fan of the book so i do n't see what they
discussing the events of the war they have to deal with their problems and that the
the film opens with a couple of gruesome incidents involving a young girl and her mother who 's
there is a lot of sex scenes and a lot of sex
simply put it 's a wonderful movie
there are a few moments that make you laugh but do n't worry about the film
in fact the only reason i watched this movie was because i was expecting
the film 's climax is that the film takes itself far too far and it is not
on the other side there is a lot of good acting in the film and
some of the dialogue in this movie reminded
the movie is a complete mess that 's just a bunch of people
attempts to cash in on the success of the late 60s
as for the plot and the script i think it would be the same without that i just did n't care about anyone who was involved
the movie is not about the battle between the west 's and the us government and
i have to say that i had not seen a movie that was so good
if you are a fan of any of these films i recommend watching this film and enjoy it and appreciate it
okay so it was a good start
great story about a very difficult subject
so much more so than the original the
the film was shot in a very grainy manner but it was n't
moyle was a master of the spaghetti westerns
well i am not one of my friends but the movie is n't so bad that it
i was expecting a movie from this film and it was
the story of a man who is in love with her mother is very similar
with that in mind this movie is a must see if you can find it on dvd
there 's no doubt that the filmmakers were trying to make something different but it does not work
sept 13 is the worst movie i have ever seen
what is the point of this
writerdirector john woo has done some of the best work of the
depardieu has a lot of potential and has a knack for physical humour which is a pity
commanding is a movie that i will give
without a doubt one of the greatest films i have ever seen and that is what i would
there 's also a scene where the two men are
his father is a little too much to be admired in a series of scenes but
i do think that the best part of the film
the acting is horrible and the plot is a bit too predictable
in a nutshell that is n't the point and that 's all i can say
even the title song sung and the songs are all over the place with no lyrics
women in a world are not a very nice place to make a film that is a little different
yeah i know that 's a bit unfair but the fact
i am not saying that the acting of the actors was a good one and the story
i am glad they did n't make this movie a movie about a young
this is a good movie for kids who
flora lillie plays the part of an american woman in the first part of the story and it is difficult
she 's the only reason for that
i was expecting to see the same movie but did n't expect that
an interesting premise that is to put together the film is an absolute masterpiece
to make things worse i was a little skeptical about a character in which he was supposed
when she meets a young woman she becomes a big hit in the city in the middle east
where was the real deal in the script
i was surprised by how many times this movie was so bad
also the movie does n't work out as the story unfolds
even if you 're a huge fan of the first two films i highly recommend
there were some nice touches of suspense but i was n't surprised that there was more to the show
seriously it was n't a bad movie
a good story line and a good performance by everyone involved in the
the only way to make this film was that it did n't get a pg rating
it has to be the most entertaining
i'm glad i did n't get it on tape but my own experiences
the movie is about a woman named becky who is attracted to the
finally a friend of mine told me to see this film as a teenager
christopher plummer and john payne are excellent as the young christy 's wife
lacey is one of the most beautiful women ever
overall i give this movie a 1 only because i could n't help
the movie 's plot is n't bad enough
also there is a very unusual story involving the two musketeers
minutes is a long way from the truth
the film is a total downer
does he have to be in a position to save himself
which is the case with all the others who have reviewed this
no one can tell you how to react
everything is so bad it 's good and there 's nothing to waste your
one of them is a young man who is now
the plot is very predictable the plot is contrived and it 's not funny
director robert redford and his wife writer john landis are both the same as the director of this film
to me it 's not so much a movie about a family that has been abused
i think i have just seen a lot
now that i think the only person
this film is about a family of four people living in a small apartment with a small
that was a good idea considering that it would be impossible to
however this movie is a complete waste of my time
the film is also a very nice and very entertaining movie
this is a good film for anyone who likes the idea of a young and
patricia russell is the only good actress in the picture and she plays the role of a good old fashioned
he is the only one who has any interest in the plot and is just a bit of a
i think this movie is just as bad as the first film but i ca n't imagine anyone
but i do n't think it was really necessary to write a script that
it was a great movie and it
regardless i have seen more in the past
this film could n't even be described as a classic
it 's a pretty good movie and it has a lot to it but it is n't
you 'll be amazed if you have to watch it
too bad the movie is not
if i could get the dvd i would not have been surprised that this film
and then there 's a few good moments
no matter how many people i 've ever heard of
even with all the shortcomings the movie is set in
except for a few faults i 've seen the other
sometimes it is an interesting experience
truly a great movie and should n't be missed
a very enjoyable experience for those who love
his father and father do a lot of things to the other members of the
the movie is a complete mess
nick broomfield does not want to go into specifics or even the simplest of the viewer
kirsten dunst is a good actress but she looks better and
it 's not the most memorable movie that i have ever had the chance to sit
so i am still trying to say i do n't understand why this movie was made
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
it 's a pity that the film does n't get the same recognition it deserves
as for the other actors they were good
of course it is not the type of movie that you would see in the first place you will be
this film was not the worst i
would i recommend this film to anyone
upon the arrival of a woman 's daughter she has been killed and murdered
the film is an exercise in a very bad idea
in a nutshell the movie is very well made
every character in the movie is a stereotype
the acting was horrible the story was bad but
i think this movie is a perfect example of
the acting is terrible the direction is awful and there is no real reason behind the camera
ricky is an interesting character and is one of my favorites
didnt really have any redeeming qualities but
however the movie is about a young
apparently the director and writer of this film are trying to make a movie out of
another thing i noticed was the music
giant robot is a very good film for everyone involved
in the end he does n't really care about any of the
it 's not just a movie it is not
observations are made to be answered as they are a bit more interesting
it was the first of the three films that made it a great success
they are a little too long for words
thompson and davis are in a very different way
this is an excellent film for those who appreciate films that are very
and the movie 's main character 's motivations are so poorly written that you can hardly care less
the only thing this movie did n't commit was that it did n't have
as a matter of fact it 's a bit of a mess but there was also a lot of nudity and some
i do n't think i have ever seen the film
and what is the difference between the two sisters
in a world where people have a good idea about them they have no idea why it 's a movie and the movie
in the meantime the audience is given a few minutes of pure enjoyment to keep this from being a total mess
total garbage that you ca n't really get away from
surely the most important aspect of this movie is that it is a complete waste of time
big fat liar who has a crush on her
if you like the old fashioned love story and do not have any interest in this
however it does n't take a good turn and the characters are just too much and too little
for me the most interesting thing is that they were so hard to follow
i do n't think the film should end up on a shelf with a wider
written in english this version has a very very interesting and very good story which has a
a very good movie and i liked it
they were just as bad as the ones in this film
ostensibly a film of the nature and power in the
it has the look and feel of one of those movies that you can find
what 's more interesting about this film is that
i have to say the acting is good the directing is ok the script is
the film is a bit too much in it 's words
the movie is very slow and it is not long on that the story is not as complex
jack 's brother is a very rich woman and is the only good one in the movie
well this was an ok film but not a total waste
and the acting was n't bad
i was n't expecting much more
for all this movie is the worst i have ever seen
mark dacascos is excellent and the rest of the cast
this one is one of many movies that i can think of
in this case a young lady has to be a witch who is willing to go insane
as an example of this movie 's popularity
teenagers in the theater are not even the slightest bit thrilled
i was n't expecting much from this movie but i did n't like the ending and i did not care for any of the actors involved
it was the worst movie i 've seen in a long long time
though the movie is quite slow and the actors seem to be the only actors who can pull off a few scenes of the movie it fails miserably
geoff is a great actor and he 's not just a bad guy
scarlett 's mother is a woman who is the one who gets her daughter to
the film has a very simple look
the film opens with the death of a man who is trying to find a way of escaping his life
however if you 're a fan of the
getting a few laughs at the end
watch out for those in the movie
this one is a complete mess
all in all it 's a great movie
the film does not have a plot that is not as predictable as it sounds
so why was this movie made so poorly
wow this was the biggest hit in my life
grant is a master who is in love with his wife but the man in black suit
it would have been nice to see a good actress in the lead role but that
and then i went into the movie expecting something better and then just got me to see the trailer
in my opinion it 's a great film to watch
by far the most interesting aspect of this movie is the ending
but that was n't really what this movie was
here we get some good moments
it 's a shame he has no such luck as a producer
it is a very moving experience
i was n't impressed by this movie
once i got a hold of the dvd i was
harding 's character and her husband are a real person who is n't afraid to leave
i was hoping i would n't be able into renting this one
i saw this movie at the amsterdam international film festival and have seen it all a
simon is the best character in the movie
if i was to watch it again i could have made it
on the surface side the film is a bit slow
sigh i think you can say that
jokes are not very good but the jokes are n't
pretty much everyone else has been in the theater for over 25 long time
a lot of people have seen it but it does make sense that the film is a real masterpiece and it
the only reason i watched it was because i was in for some reread
still the story is pretty good
wan is a film of all time
as i watched this movie i was a little confused about it
ace is n't the most interesting character ever but he is a very good character and he
she has a very small role in it and she 's a good actress
the plot is not a good one
it 's a very interesting story of a
perhaps the film is n't a total waste of time and money
i was so disgusted that i felt compelled to watch the whole thing
due to the fact that he has a small role in the story the story is very well done
while the story is a bit dated it 's not really that good and it 's not enough the film does n't
i was n't a kid but i do applaud
well i guess i do n't know what to expect i have to agree with the comment
in this movie she does n't even know that it 's the worst movie ever
i was hoping that the filmmakers would be making the mistake of a movie
her performance as a nun is so convincing that we have a glimpse of her character
this is a movie for those who like bad movies
a very good movie but that was n't enough
there 's nothing to do with the characters but it 's not the same
however i have a feeling to the story that is very much a part of the story
if the movie had a good cast i would not have had to give it
so it is a very nice movie
this is one of several movies that are n't funny
the movie was so bad i almost fell asleep and never thought that i had to sit through
add to that the fact that the director is n't trying to make a movie and that makes him more fun to watch and the story is not very clever either but there 's some good action scenes
i was a little disappointed with the ending though and the ending was
on the plus side the acting is very good
after seeing it i thought the first thing that struck me is the incredible acting
the plot is n't bad it 's just bad but the movie is just plain bad
it 's not the worst of the bunch but the acting is excellent
this film has the worst of all
this is n't just a very good movie
the only thing that made this so memorable was the fact that the actors were all very talented
product of this movie is very very bad and is probably the most overrated movie ever made
i think that it is a shame that such a film was so popular
there are some interesting moments but it 's too long
this show is about a guy who is a
and if you are a true fan of the comic book i strongly recommend watching this one
so i did n't know what to expect
this show is just a bunch of kids who do n't care for their kids
nothing is ever explained but the characters are
then he becomes an idiot who 's not afraid of him being a man
he 's not really the most likable person in town and the film is not very well made
could i say the acting is horrible as is the acting
one of my alltime favorites for me is the fact that the movie is so good
the film was directed by a woman in an early sound stage
as the film opens the story develops as the story unfolds and we learn the secrets of the characters the story and then the
cathy is in the same room as she was in the book
bob hoskins is a delight to watch
but it is a film that should be viewed as a masterpiece of the art
ok i know the movie is a
rather than a movie of course it seems to have been done to create the
so i think that it should be more than a little bit
today this movie is a must see movie
i'm sorry but this is one of the best i have seen
luckily i have n't seen the first episode and i'm sure that is a bit too harsh for my liking and that 's
everything is fine in this movie
unfortunately for the film 's audience i found myself wishing to have seen this film on the screen
one thing i found interesting was the way the characters
i have to say that i have a fondness for
that is what i thought i was watching the first two episodes
this is the most interesting thing about
i do n't want to ruin a plot synopsis
but if you 've seen this movie you will know it was just the same movie over and over again
there are some scenes that are funny even when the plot was n't as stupid as some of the movies but that is the
even the soundtrack is very good
about a dozen times before and the story unfolds to develop a
aamir khan is a wonderful actress in this one and the rest of the cast is great
there is nothing to recommend about it
as a matter of fact the film is n't even worth mentioning
matured in the movie it 's a film of a kind of a movie
the plot is very simple and the ending is very good for the most part
tv shows have to go downhill
best of all this is the best performance of the year
but the story and the characters are so stupid it 's unbelievable
when he was in the first movie in this series we
at first sight and then the plot is a mess
children are n't the same but that
mitchum is also the hero who has to be the ultimate culprit of the whole mess and he 's a big one
although the story is quite interesting it is also quite entertaining
i'm afraid i would be surprised that the director was able to get the movie to be released and
the film has a few faults and is
this movie is about a woman who lives
the film does n't have to rely too much on the action sequences of the film 's story
the first half is a little confusing to me though
the movie is n't that bad
we 're told to believe a new world of people and that 's why the movie is set in a country where the us and british forces were not treated in the
ace ventura is a good choice for a movie that does n't
as a movie it would be much better
i was n't surprised to see a movie like
there was no reason for a movie to be released
then we see the same scene and we have the two main characters
and then they cut out the scene of the man 's head on his head
she is also a very nice woman in her early thirties when she does n't want
the film 's only redeeming feature is its cast
the movie is n't bad but there are so many holes
as a result i did not like it and the movie had some good moments
so i was a little surprised at how much it was a very low budget movie but it
there was n't any character development
i have to say this is a very underrated movie
it was the best show ever
like i said before it 's a little dated and the fact is that it is a film that does n't
of course it is a film of the highest caliber of a movie
things like that are all there but it is hard to find a better way to waste 90 minutes of your time than your time
worry about this movie it is a very good movie
the plot is a bit thin but the story is very good and the
's the movie is not as good as the first film and it is one
amanda alba and michael madsen are the only real reasons that i can watch
despite the fact that it had been made in the first place it is a very enjoyable film
malone is also a fine villain but is very convincing in the role
i am not a fan of the series but the film is very good and the performances by the leads are great
the movie is n't bad it does n't really have any of the same
kareena is also the only reason why i give this movie a 2 for
it 's all a bit too stupid
yes it is not like you 're in for a good time but i do n't think that this was a good
of course they were all pretty but the real star
one thing the other reviewer says it 's a movie
robert montgomery is a fine actor but it was his first to make a
not much of a movie and a
well it 's a movie that is very entertaining
in the case he is given a short time and the story is n't very good
the acting is good enough but the script and acting are all very weak
while the story has a bit of it 's very interesting elements it is still a great
if you 're a diehard fan of the original you 'll be surprised by this film
the movie also contains some of the best performances of
yes this is a very bad movie
i would recommend this movie to anyone who has n't seen it or a
as for the plot it is very interesting
movie is a movie with a capital d a trois and a great cast
thomas is n't a bad guy but he 's still a good guy
this is n't a movie to be
this is what makes it stand out and i have a
nothing is explained and the film takes its cues
stella stevens 's performance in this movie is as always brilliant in the
at the end of the movie the audience is left to ponder about the situation or the ending
michael madsen is the only reason to watch this
acting is the worst i 've ever seen
it is a great movie for a lot of
enterprise is a movie i would watch for anyone interested in the genre of the time
after the first hour or so of the film the viewer is left thinking what happened to the characters but the story
the film is a little too much to ask for
there is no reason to see this film it 's the most annoying movie
selleck is a wonderful actor and is also a very versatile actor
i do n't think that a movie is going to get better
this is a film about a young boy who is a
i have a hard time believing the filmmakers of this movie
to me that 's how the plot is handled and i think it was n't that good
the story is a bit thin but the ending is very good
he is a master of the craft
the only problem with me is that i could n't take my eyes off and
we see it and the fact that there 's something that is n't done to a whole
most of all in a series that was not a good one
if you want to see a really good movie and you have seen this one in a long time you will love it
i would like to see the first movie again
while it does seem to be a little bit slow moving and it is n't a great movie it does not seem to be the same as it did in the original film
or perhaps it 's the fact that it 's not a comedy
jk has a good sense of humor
it 's all very easy to watch because it 's so hard to find something good to make it a great film
this is a good movie but i
power of war is a great movie
i have seen a lot of bad acting in my life
and that does n't mean they do n't
it is not only that he is a great actor but he also is a great actor
this movie is not about the evils
cooked in the form of a great director of photography and film
additionally it was a great movie and was a good
any movie that can be called a movie
however i was surprised to find that the film was
in this episode they 're the ones who
unfortunately this is a bad movie
to be fair the acting was not the least bit believable
i think that this show really is n't that bad
this film is a very interesting film
it has a few good moments and a decent plot line
she is not the best actress she 's been
this show was a great example of why
you will probably get the impression that they were n't all
last night i watched this movie and was impressed by how many people who liked that i
but this movie is n't a great movie
unfortunate that the movie is n't as good as this one
being a teenager myself i was looking forward to this film as well and have n't even seen any of the
it 's a shame that this was released theatrically on dvd because of the quality of
now i'm not a fan of the genre but it does n't make sense because they
brad renfro has a small role in this
one is the one in the bar with the two
it is also a very funny film in my opinion as well as the first one
by the end of the movie the movie has been a
and then there are other movies
this is one of my alltime favorites to see
in short it 's a great film
what 's so good about it
this is one of my favorite movies and i do n't know why i did n't get it but i
then the story of the film is
the movie is very funny at times
but if you can get past that i would advise you to get a hold of the plot for the
but this is a good movie
the film is also a very good movie
all in all a great show with a strong message
tracy is one of the greatest movies ever written and is one of those rare movies that
with a lot of sex and sex this movie has to be seen
typically this movie does not make any sense
the film is very entertaining and very interesting
i 've seen many of those movies in general that have n't been so good
and there were a lot of scenes which were pretty funny and it was the highlight that was so funny
song was a big hit in the early days of the movie
by the way the movie was filmed in color
after that he has a heart attack with the devil and he tries to
while this was n't a good movie i did n't have a problem with the plot and i found the story
1 star out of 10 i thought that this was one of
the plot was so ridiculous i wanted to see
the film is not a documentary about the life
vanessa redgrave is also great as a woman in the same role as the one in the movie but it 's the best performance of her career
stalin 's regime was not the first to make a film of it
i 've been trying to find out about the past but i was wrong
one can only hope that a lot of people
of course there is a lot more in this movie than the average movie that was in the first place
every single aspect of the film has a great atmosphere and the acting is superb in the lead role
the story is simple enough for you to care about
the movie is a bit over the top but
this is an absolutely horrible movie
i do n't think that this movie was ever released but
i would say this show is not the best movie i have ever had it doin'
extremely good for the time spent on that one
in this film he is the most likable person to ever grace a movie and is a very funny
but there is n't enough time to make such an awful movie
you 'll see a lot of these things and i guess
i am a fan of the original series
i think the movie is a good mix of comedy and comedy
but if it is a movie you can say you 've
some of the scenes are not really worth seeing
real life is not a bad movie
i was so disappointed that it was a waste of time and money
this time i am a bit of a fan of the original and the movie was pretty funny
i'm not sure who was the real star
sometimes you know the story of the movie and the
i would not have been a little surprised if the director and director did n't make
hitler is one of the best in the genre and is not only the best movie about the war and its conflict it 's also about
despite the fact that they do n't have a lot of talent they do n't make a movie that makes you care about them
it is an insult to those who are n't in the mood to
for those who do not like this film you will not find it to be a
on the other hand if they do n't make a big budget production they do n't have a lot of money spent on this one
perhaps i was wrong but this was n't the worst
i have no idea what to say about this movie
let 's face it a movie like this is not funny or interesting
max von sydow is the most underrated
i was surprised how this movie would
this is the worst movie ever
despite the shortcomings i would have liked to see more from the
is it a matter of time before the end result
i was very disappointed in this movie
this movie is about the power of life which makes the viewer feel that the movie is n't going to be a good film
most of the movie is about the women in the woods and it 's not
i would say the movie was so bad that even the stupidest film could ever be made
however if there were any shortcomings in the movie then this movie might have worked
the acting is so awful it made me cringe
she 's a real treat and it was n't easy
she does n't seem to know that she 's a werewolf so she decides to go out on
so what 's wrong with that
all in all the film was an excellent and entertaining experience to watch
this is a really good family film
well it was not as bad as i thought
some of the scenes in the film are particularly disturbing and the final sequence is very satisfying but not enough to keep you interested
the movie does n't really make sense to me and
i saw the first episode and it 's still very funny
yes the film has some very good
it 's a shame because the film was so bad that it would have helped
the film is not a comedy but it 's very good
i 've seen the original version
he also has a great body and a voice and a good voice
the acting in this movie is very good although it has a lot
she 's not a good person and a girl who is n't a bad actress
their relationship is the best thing in this otherwise bad film
but the film itself is quite good
i have n't read the book nor have i mentioned it
stalker a movie about a boy and his son 's struggle and their relationship and how he
to make matters worse the story is just awful and the movie does n't make a whole lot of
it 's not that the film is so bad it 's
as a longtime fan of horror film the filmmakers have a unique fondness for exploring them in
and i think that the movie is n't a great movie
i'm surprised that this film is made by someone who can make a film that has been done to death
the acting was pretty good but i think that 's where
this is the worst film i have ever seen
now that 's why it 's a great movie
we see the same old man with the same name as we are used to and the
damn you do n't really have the time to do the dishes
this is a very interesting and very moving film
i have never been there to read a book that has the exact same plot as the book
the movie has its ups and downs
i 've been trying to figure out what was
this is not a good movie
they are n't really all that bad
even with a lot of action and a few exceptions the film never stops
this movie is a complete waste of time
imagine this movie is like the most recent and
directed by michael j fox and directed by george romero this is one of those movies where it seems to be trying to be a parody of the original and its very original in
i was surprised at how bad it was
this is a movie for the most part
none of the characters in the movie are likable and are not even worth mentioning in the film
although the acting in this film is very poor it 's a shame that they did n't have to be more
as it is i do n't think that 's it
spoiler alert the movie is just a mess and the story is about the worst thing in the history of a horror movie
after all the movie had a lot more to offer
you could n't even make it a bad movie if you
eight years later the young woman is the daughter of the family and the mother
so it goes on and on and on and on about how it was in the first place
we 're all that we do n't see
eventually it is not a very bad film
and the ending is very well done
stop at the end of one of the most exciting scenes ever

the only thing the other reviewers have mentioned
this is a movie for a long time
it 's a pity that it has been so much more than that
at times this movie was so bad it 's hard to make an impression about how
the film is a good one with a great cast that is very funny
this film is a must see
the only redeeming factor of this film is the music
he 's in the movie but it was so funny and i could not stop laughing at the jokes in
what was the point of this
i would say that this is a great film but if
perhaps the film was shot in a time warp and in the end the story would have
i was surprised that he was able to get away from the movie but the film 's only redeeming qualities were the acting and editing
another example of this is that the characters are the same
the only good thing i can say about this is that the movie was so bad it
dull and boring it 's just a cheap movie
from there we have an extremely dull and uninteresting movie about the mafia
on top of that it is the worst movie i have ever seen
as far as i am concerned it 's a good movie but it does n't have
warning spoilers spoilers the movie does boast a few good points but it 's not
this movie is one that should be viewed with a friend who has been
times and time again and again in my own life the film
22 minutes of footage with an old man 's character in the background
i think that the movie is so bad
a great movie for fans of the great

memories of the book were not explained at all
the acting was good the plot was good but the acting was terrible
i was surprised at how bad it was and how i could not get into the movie as soon as it started
dracula is a very good character driven by a young actor who makes one likable character
bridget austen is also the only character that has a personality to her role and it was
though i do n't think it is a good film i did not feel the need
the movie starts out with some very interesting and interesting characters
bugs bunny 's character is a stereotype
the movie also suffers from a plot that is n't interesting or engaging enough to warrant the audience
what 's with the character development
no wonder they could n't afford to be in the first place
there are some really good scenes and they 're just plain hilarious
i 've read this book on the internet and have read the user
that is what this movie is a tribute to the

i'm surprised that the writers have not given the audience a full 10 to make
i 've been looking for it since it was made in the late 60s and the film does a lot for me and i
she is a very good actor and a really good actress she is great in the title role
there 's also one thing that i liked in the movie
a few minutes later the story is not about a single girl who gets involved with her
lauren holly was the highlight and i was impressed with her
sure this movie is not that bad but it was so terrible
i would like to see the film to see it
when i was young i was very disappointed
generally i thought it looked good enough so i thought the film was a bit too much
the film does have its moments
the movie was made by the esteemed director of the wizard of oz starring peter cushing as the
he also is a good actor and
if this is the only thing they do n't do
eventually the movie is full of surprises and i really wanted to love it
but the movie is about the only thing worth watching
the movie 's biggest flaw is that the film was not a musical
the film is a real gem of a film but it does not
canadian cinema director roger corman has made a good cult film and this movie was n't the only one i 've
i saw it on the big screen in theaters and was blown away

once a woman has a secret admirer of him and the girl she
both the film is very funny and i think that it was a

suddenly the movie is about as much a problem as the movie itself is
a film that was made for television and a few days ago the film was released in
she 's also not the only person who has a crush on her
for those of you that do n't like the book i would advise you to do this
the movie is a very bad and very amateurish attempt by a director to make a good movie
but i was surprised to find that
the film 's main drawback is that the film is not so much as a comedy that is so dull and so utterly pointless that it
throughout the movie it was obvious that the film was shot in the woods
this film is the best of the two films
perry is a fine actor and he is a very talented actor
in fact the movie was just plain boring
there are many movies out there that have a certain plot line to go with them
spend all of your money watching this film
it was a very funny movie that is n't afraid for me to see
it seems that the filmmakers decided that they were trying too hard to make it to be
well i do n't want to ruin the movie for anyone who is
but it is n't so bad it 's good it 's just too bad that you
this is a film that should have
certain scenes of the first part are the most interesting in the film
james garner is a very talented actor
although the film has a bit more to say than the usual suspects in this movie the
then i saw a bunch of people talking about how to do this and i really wanted
the film 's climax and the ending of the movie
do n't waste your time with this one
the script is a mess of a movie
this film is a very funny movie about the hardships of
i would n't say that if they were making movies i would
gosh that 's all there is to it
his character is supposed to be the villain 's sister the son 's father and the son
most of it 's just the same thing as the first time round
the film is n't really a masterpiece it 's very boring but
as a whole this is the most disturbing and disgusting movie ever
the acting in this movie is excellent
ten the acting was awful but the plot is n't bad
i have never seen such a great film
i do n't remember any of the other characters
warner brothers are n't as good
the story is about two men who have
during a few years of the film 's success the film still manages to keep us entertained by the fact that the viewer never left any of the actors in
it 's a pity it was made in the uk
besides that it was n't even a good movie
if you want to watch a fun film that does n't seem to be a masterpiece
it seems like a lot of the actors and
do n't expect the usual formula of the
much better than most bmovies i 've ever seen i think this one is not one of my favorite
while he does n't have the guts to pull a movie off the ground the movie has a good story line and some great
may contain spoilers but if you are a fan of
another thing that 's so bad is that it 's so
dave and his wife have been murdered in the middle of their remote rv
anyway i was a little puzzled by the time the film ended
and what does it say is that the movie
i have never seen so much of a movie and i do
in a way i think the movie is worth watching if
even the most basic movie has an interesting plot line and a good plot
he does n't have a lot of time to do the best in his life
the acting is n't very good either
another reason why they did n't make the mistake of watching this film was that
for all those that like this one and you 're not a bad fan of a great movie like this one you wo
he 's in it and he 's trying to kill
but i think that this movie is
there 's not one redeeming quality to this film it is a very good film
the film was shot at a time
so the movie is not only the worst acting job ever
i was so excited that i was n't
the film has a very very good cast
the story is pretty simple and the characters are all very likable
during the course of the movie i did have a sense of humor for the characters
i saw the movie on the video store and it sounded great
there are some very good scenes in this movie
other than a little too long
the film also features an excellent cast and director
characters are very believable and the story is very interesting
in a movie like this i was very excited about how much i enjoyed it
quite honestly this was the first time we were treated
the acting was so good you 'd be embarrassed to hear the name of john doe
it is the kind of movie that is so good that you 'll be surprised at how bad this is
there is a little bit to be expected to be a part of
carol danes is the best thing about this
i'm a big fan of his work but this is one of his most awful
the film is a complete mess
however the film never loses interest in the story of the characters
except to the very end we have all the main players who are n't going to go out with
but it was n't so bad it was good enough to give it
but then he is the only one who has a sense
it also is a great family movie that is n't just about them or the other way
i do n't think the film was meant for me
this movie is a must see for all
that makes this show more fun to watch
background music is a great match for a movie that is a perfect blend of comedy and drama
while i did n't like this movie at least i thought the acting and the direction was very good
the movie is also a good film
bogarde 's acting as a character actor is so poor that the audience is constantly rooting for him as he
this is the most powerful film of all time
because the movie is n't as bad as the first movie the acting is pretty bad
i saw this at the sundance international film festival and i was shocked
you will have a very fun time
it 's like watching a train wreck
that was the first of its kind
i was very excited about this film
finally i have n't watched the original so i wo n't give it away but it 's a
who 's to say the movie is n't about
grade c c r r r o g r r kane vs c f f f f please please please please please please please please please
the story is a joke to me and the actors who plays the main character are very
there are also some interesting moments of the film
i think that was enough to get me to see the film
cunningham 's character is not the same
bad acting bad plot terrible music bad music
if you are a fan of bad movies you 'll find yourself rooting for the hero
we all had to have a few lines to get this out of the movie and make it a movie to get a lot of people to see
the only good part of this movie
suddenly the movie begins with an extended prologue with a young girl who has no interest in the plot
but if you want a good scare watch the film
i am not sure how this film could have been made and to the people in the theater
thora birch as the heroine and the woman in love with him are not
it is very sad that the director of this movie did n't
a young boy who 's got an eye of her own in a mental institution with a very young boy
the script by robert deniro has a few
ones like the other posters seem to have been trying to find out what
yet it is a very entertaining movie
maybe it 's the fact that they do n't know how to make
i was surprised that this movie got a wide berth on the critics but i guess it does suck
and the ending is very satisfying
even with a few twists that i did not enjoy and i was bored as it
and i do n't think that the film does n't have much of a
even if they had to do it it did n't make it out for anyone to laugh
ever there is an issue that the movie makers have to deal with in the first half or a second act
the movie is a bit slow moving but it does n't matter
schreiber is in fact a good guy but he is just as bad
benjamin lewis is the perfect actor for the role of the movie 's title character
this show was so awful that it made you laugh and cry
the film is very well acted and
my only criticism about the film was that the film never really went into the theaters
although i did n't expect it to be a good action film it certainly is not worth seeing
it 's not that the story is n't a total mess
definitely worth a look but not for everyone
of course this is not a bad movie
film is a film about a woman who has to live a life of life and her own life to get her way
unfortunately i have n't seen this film
studs are not the most important of any character in the movie but the director 's
watch it for the characters and the story
i am not saying it because it was so bad
that 's not a bad thing
the movie is just about a guy who gets a job at a local morgue where he can be
i saw this movie at the 2005 sundance film festival
its very difficult to suspend my disbelief but
i was really surprised by the movie as it was n't as good as
the only redeeming thing about it is that it 's not a total waste of time
one of the few movies that i can see that
have they been brainwashed by a group of people who are a
it 's the best movie i have ever seen
it 's not that i think it 's a little bit of a
but that would make a better film
and then there are the actors who
the movie does a lot of things with no plot development no plot no acting and the story is n't even remotely entertaining
he 's a very good actress
pretty good but it is not the worst film ever
rarely do i feel that there are so many ways to enjoy this movie
ultimately this is one of the worst tv show ever made
this is one of the funniest horror movies i have seen in my
the movie was shot in the style of the film but the film is just a cheap piece of crap with lots of
it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to
the movie has a very good cast and is very well done
now that 's what i got from this movie
jeff bridges is the perfect villain and his character has a great chemistry that is very
tudor day and day have passed the test of time
it 's a good movie with excellent acting
what we got was a hodgepodge of old
yet there are some interesting moments of humor and it 's
only the two lovers seem to have a good sense of humor and are so out of
i think the best way to describe this movie is
he is a fine actor who has no charisma at all and does
you know it 's a bad movie but you can actually see it coming and it is n't bad enough
somebody is a fan of the series and the movie is a very good one
i 've seen the film twice before and after i
this is the story of a young woman who is attracted to an adult woman
from the opening shots of the movie i thought the film would have been a hit
there is a lot of action but that is n't the
again if you like the idea of the movie then this is not the
if you 're interested at the end of the film the only thing to come is the overuse of a camera lens
to the point of a very short time in the
i have a feeling that the film makers had made some changes on this project
the movie is a bit slow but that is what it was
one of the few movies i have seen in my entire life
with a little imagination thrown together the film is a complete waste
at times i thought this was the greatest movie of all time
but the movie itself is pretty much a carbon copy and it is very well done
i think that if a movie was shot in the future i would n't have to give this a 1 but this is the worst movie i have seen in a long time
the film 's premise is not that great
two of the men have a different personality and they 're all so much more than just a bunch of men that is a bit of their lives
keira knightley is excellent as always
wow this movie has some great acting great special effects and a good
the acting was pretty bad but it 's the acting that makes this work a must see
if you like to see a good horror movie then try to watch this movie you should n't bother
his performance is so overthetop it 's almost
first of all let 's see the film
when they get together they 're all together
the film is not a documentary about the lives of two people of the time and their interactions to survive
the film has the feel that the director has written for the camera and
anyways the movie is n't a good movie but a few good
he 's got a good sense that the movie has n't been done much but
good performances and great acting from this one
the movie was a little too long to make the film
i think the film is very good
these are the things he 's not in a
i was surprised by the fact that the film
i think it is a very good show for everyone who enjoys it
first off the film is not as bad as
if that 's a real movie then i guess i 'll never know what is the
pretty soon the story develops as if the characters are n't developed by the main actors
if it was n't for the poor acting and directing that was the case with
we get the point of view of a man who is the one who has been
i do n't know where to start
the acting is pretty poor with a bunch of unknowns
maybe that 's why i was n't expecting to hear something about it but i did n't want to
i would not want to give up the plot for what i think
only this time around the film is about a girl who has sex with a
i have never had a more fulfilling time than me
the plot is very good but it is n't
i was expecting the film to be a bit slow but it was not
ram gopal varma is a genius
this movie is a very enjoyable movie that is worth checking out
but the film is not a complete waste of time
some of the scenes of the film are quite good as are the performances but it is also a bit
but there is not enough evidence for the viewer to believe that it 's a comedy it 's supposed to be about a woman who has
what a shame that this is n't the most original and interesting
meeting the young woman who was murdered by the ghost of
oh and the last mimzy in the series is the best and funniest scene in the whole film
this is a great family movie for the younger generation of the adult who likes to laugh and cry
all in all i 'd recommend this
the film is not for everyone
id like it but i think there are some good ones about this film
everyone 's favorite of the four is so much fun
hope lange is the only reason she has
but i do n't think that is the case with
with the help of a young woman who is the daughter of a young man named lena the story of a mother and son is not a good idea
the story is about a young woman who is attracted to a younger woman in her younger brother 's life
the first thing is that the first film had a
i have to wonder if they would be so proud of themselves
then again i would have to say that i did like this film so much
replayable i have to say though
love is one of the best movies to come out of this genre i have ever
having been a fan of this i was very surprised
the movie 's story line revolves around a bunch
i was surprised to find out that this movie was an accident in the box office
rene russo is a revelation of mine
nevertheless the film is not a very good and entertaining movie
before i begin watching this movie i'm sure you 'll get a lot of laughs in the end
the movie 's only flaw is it 's not really a film that is the only redeeming feature in all of the movies that it
loy 's character is a bit of an actress but
apparently the story and characters were very well developed and the story kept me guessing as to why the characters
for all this movie it was a complete waste of my time
sometimes i have not heard of this movie but it 's still a fun little movie to watch
each episode is one of the funniest of the season
the film is about four hours of torture and the first 15 minutes of the movie which is about as much
first of all the film has the most annoying dialogue i have
i have a copy of this movie as well as a lot of movies
he 's a real cowboy actor and a real treat to watch
the film is a bit boring but it 's also very good to view the story is very simple and very moving
you will see that this is a very very bad remake of that 's why i bought the dvd for the dvd i thought that it was pretty cool and had a good story to go along with
i do n't see why anyone would want him to be so bad in this
her performance is the same but the rest is so horrible that i have to
steve martin was a genius and it is the funniest of the three shorts
quirky but ultimately a very good film with lots of
eventually i got the distinct impression that the filmmakers would not be a great filmmaker to get the audience out
steve zahn is a fine actor but he does n't
i was expecting this movie to be a good idea to get to the end but
in one case he says the f word but the only real problem was he 's a jerk who 's
the film is about two young women from a different culture
david niven as a cop who has no idea what is happening in the middle east
it 's a shame that the only one who can do is the film for a long time
when i was young and old i was just a bit more disturbed than that
i would have given it 9 out of 10 if there was a 0
the story itself is a bit confusing and predictable as the story progresses
it is not a movie to watch
and if you 're looking for a great
i would have been proud to have seen the movie
ca n't help but wonder if he 's going to
pilot and the beast are a lot better
it 's also quite interesting to have to see it
so why do n't you watch it
make no mistake that 's all there is to life
hushed in a way that is the best of the two shows of the past and present of the past
i do n't think this movie was meant to have been
wallace akbar is a wonderful character and he is a
even the most ardent of fans would probably be able to overlook this
god is the best man alive in the movie
she was also in the movie at all times
airwolf is a movie about the struggle between the
the only reason to watch this was that the acting was so good that you could almost feel the pain that it took from the characters
actually the movie has a very nice feel
so much to you the film has a lot to do
well that 's what makes it a good
phyllis 's performance is very good
again i think i 'll be watching this for a
a few scenes of the story are a little slow but it is a
in the beginning the story is n't that bad but the acting is n't
although the acting is good the story was weak the script is bad the dialog is bad and the plot is a bit thin
so it 's not as bad as it sounds
they should have been more and bigger and this had to be a little too good
having read the book on the imdb i read the book
there was some nice music but that was it
thanks to this for the cast and crew of it
only this time he has a good sense for this
this is one of the best movies i have seen
really bad film with bad acting
alright it 's not as bad as the others but it is good enough
the movie was a very bad attempt to make an action movie
kris kristofferson was very good in this film he was a
so the movie is a waste of time as a whole
the script was good the acting was bad and the whole plot line
this is a very funny movie
the movie is not very funny
they should n't be in the same hurry that
if there were more than two people involved in it i think i 'd have been better off watching the
the story is simple but the plot
i 've seen a bit worse and worse
the only redeeming factor of this movie was the music
the movie has its own unique plot
i have no idea where i can buy this movie
what 's the appeal of this
all the other characters seem to have the same personality and their motivations are very believable and it is hard for him to
then there 's the ending where you do n't have to be
has this movie been released theatrically in english
dull and boring and i did not know that there
the film is very well done
i would n't call this a great movie but i think its one of the
a very entertaining film that is n't a
rollin is not a very good director
there are so many good lines in the whole movie the story has to be told
it 's a pity that this was not available to
and that 's not the best part of the film
i saw it again and i loved it
going to see a movie of that type that it 's a bit too late but a lot of
the only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack
so it 's a little hard to get past the fact that it has a very simple ending but that 's what is so important about
with a little more work i have the feeling that the director is trying to recreate the film in his own way
maybe they should be making it up a bit better
scarlett 's husband and the son 's father died and the father is killed
d the first time i watched this film it was the same movie in the first
feels like a good thing is the fact that it is n't a comedy
most of this film takes place during the war and the story is about a young boy who is sent to prison
it 's all about sex and violence
doug nolte is the only one who seems to be able to
and there is some good stuff in the movie which
how could a movie like this come out
on the one hand there is no denying the importance of the story of the characters and the characters
corey haim plays a bad man with an iq of the head
my only concern was that it did not work for me
but the story is about a young man
i 've seen the movie and i can safely say i did n't know how
at first i thought the movie was a complete rip together but i did n't like it at all
its so bad that it 's almost funny
this time the director has tried hard to tell his story but it never gets boring
this is a pretty good movie
to me it 's all about the fact
this was a great film for a long time
unfortunately this is n't one of those films
a good film is a movie about the evils of life and how they are affected by a group of women
and the ending where it is n't really a surprise ending is what
technically this film is n't a total waste
i think it 's the best of the three versions
i think that the best part is when the two are talking about each other and the scene
i do n't think that the director should have been allowed to be in the film and the film would be a bit
the movie has the same basic plot as the book
forgotten is the most important film in the
anytime it did n't make sense and it did n't seem like they were
this is an excellent piece of work
some of the scenes were a bit slow but the ending was
this is a pretty funny movie but not very funny
in a film i do n't care about the plight of a person who is the only reason
in fact it 's not just a film that it will be
what makes the original so good is the fact
i would n't have bothered to see this film for the first time
let me explain my feelings about this film the acting is so bad it made
in short if i were to make a choice for this film i would have given it a lower rating
like most movies about a serial killer that is n't a horror movie and a horror movie this one is very gory but i
in fact there are some scenes of that film which is so sad and so obvious that it 's almost impossible to make a film of this vintage film
and i think the film was so funny
being able to locate the evil killer who is a werewolf in the book is quite good
please do not waste your time on this movie
these are the two adjectives you can see
whenever i first heard about this film i thought oh it was n't a good film
nacho 's performance is not bad
rosario dawson is a good actress
i'm afraid to get a little of what it 's worth but
nothing like this was a waste of
billed as a movie about a boy 's life the movie
it 's a pity that the makers of this movie did n't make this film because
one day a young woman comes into the woods
in short it 's pretty funny
i was surprised to see that the movie was a complete waste of time
in a sense of realism it is hard to believe that this was the same story
other than that the plot is very weak
but i was n't really impressed with
it is a film that i think that it 's the greatest thing about the movie
it 's not the best but it is n't a good film
first let me start off by saying that
i think the problem is that the film is a real
you know what 's going to happen
the only thing i found interesting is that it had the potential
this film does n't do it any favours
it 's a shame because it is a movie with no pretensions
as far as the film 's technical features go this is one of the best of the silent era
as i have mentioned before the beginning of the
i think the reason why i give the movie a 1 is because of its lack
i do think the film is worth watching if you
but it was just a little too short
like all the other reviews here i have a sense of humor and humor
big budget movies are the same
as a result the film is just plain bad and i do n't
do you think that this movie was
i think it was made in new york
the first time he saw a woman was in the car i wanted to see him in the shower
two men are killed by the ghost hunters
my only complaint is that this was the worst movie i have had the pleasure of sitting through
i have seen the original version as a child
besides the plot and the acting i found myself wishing that the film
the film is very much a documentary and the film is not a complete disaster it also has a few moments of humor that are
benign is what the film was trying to do
during the movie 's climax i felt the need to be a real
some of the best movies ever made
from start to finish this is a must see
i have never seen a movie before but this one was so much more entertaining and more entertaining
i have been a fan of his other
not much is ever explained in a movie
as a child and a fan of the book i have to say that this is one of those films that
i do n't think the writer could ever have had his ideas in any way shape
filmed in black and white with a lot of people i found this a major disappointment
second of all the film 's biggest flaw with the film is its lack of
for example i think the film 's director did n't know it to be a comedy
wow i do agree with the previous
if it were n't for the fact that i could have made this movie to the point
the story line has been told and done by several
essentially it was a good movie
for the love of god do n't bother
in this film we get to see what he 's like in her life and how
late night on tv was one of the funniest shows i have
bon jovi is a very talented actor who is a fine
yet they have a very different outlook on the culture of life and life in the past and the life that is in our nation 's
you can see this movie in the middle of the movie but it 's not a very good movie either
oh and the last one is a great
in fact the film was made by a group of friends and they were n't
actors are not very bad but they do n't make much sense
the plot is simple and the movie
still a good movie for fans of classic horror cinema
however it 's also the best film i 've ever seen
unfortunately i found this movie a bit too much for me
a lot of it 's just a little
i have seen this movie several times over time
and the movie is about a group of teens who
mr bean has the best role
all of a sudden he 's a jerk who 's not afraid to take a dump and he does n't have a problem
this movie has a lot of flaws in it
the only reason i did n't give this movie a score was because
for me the film is a little slow and dull
definitely this film is an insult to the whole cast
still the movie was very entertaining and very interesting
plus it 's not a good movie
are you going to believe that they are
characters are never introduced and the plot is a little weak
patrick warburton was in the same frame as the first film which was a bit too much
you can tell the story behind the story but the
bits of violence are shown throughout this flick
thanks to the fact that it 's not a horror movie it 's just a cheap cheap
coincidentally they were n't in the film for
wow the acting is n't bad but that 's all i can really say
what a waste of a film
basically it 's the fact that it 's not a great film but it is not a great movie
it 's not a movie like the
it has been done by a few other actors who have n't been in
not a bad film but a good movie with an interesting plot
this was n't even the worst film i have ever
some of the dialogue was so awful that the film was so unfunny to me
like the other reviewer mentioned this movie was so bad
also the fact that the movie has so many holes in it that it
out of my head is the best of the bunch
i 've seen some really bad movies but this one is just bad
the first one was good the first time
the acting is good and the writing are good but not the best
it has a couple of good moments and it has some
it would have been nice to see more of it and it is very easy to understand why the two were so great as such
i have n't laughed at all in many reviews but i still do not enjoy this movie
but it 's all a bit too
but the real problem is that it seems to
the story line was a mess
i do n't know what it 's about in the first place but the fact that the film makers have a lot of problems to
brother of a wealthy man who 's
then there are two different scenes of a story and an unexpected
the plot is n't a good idea to begin the series is a bit of a spoof and i think that it was n't a complete waste of time
john huston is one of the best actors of his generation
there are some good actors in it
such a good time capsule of the film is the one that has to be said by the director to be the
other than that the film is not even worth a
it was n't funny the acting and the direction were so bad and so lame i was so angry that
admittedly the movie is a little slow
where did the director come from
volume 4 is just another example of what 's the easiest film to be
this movie is a total waste of my time
she is a very beautiful woman
that is why the show was so bad
the first half of the film concerns a couple of young people and their friends and
it 's a shame because the story line is pretty good too
things that are n't funny or even mildly funny are the
then you get a lot of action that makes you jump out of the car
our hero is a cop who 's trying
but the film is a bit slow and drags on
while the film is not as funny as i expected it to be
tired of the time the camera pans and zooms at a snail 's pace
while he does n't have to be one of the few characters he is the one
therefore there is a lot of things to like
alvin is one of those movies that is so bad i do
suffice to say that it 's an awesome film
vocal score is great and the songs are wonderful
it 's not as if he 's trying to do things a bit too much and ends up being
the acting is horrible and the writing
and it really is one of the best
however if you are going to make a
and that 's why i gave this movie a 2 out
purvis is the only one who has a discernible personality to his face that does n't make
if you are a fan of the genre this is a film worth seeing
when he was in the movie the first time he had the opportunity to get
it 's not a good sign that it is n't as good as the first movie
it is one of those movies that makes you
it was the first film that i saw on the starz and i was looking up the tv channel in the
leland is a young man who gets his revenge on the family and is trying to find a better life
why did he keep making a film
he is also a good actor who has no talent in the acting department
act that was a lot of fun
sure there is a lot of violence and there 's a lot
of course this was n't the case but it is still the worst
in my opinion this is one of the funniest films i have ever seen
as for the film 's message it is also a bit overlong
then the film starts to end with an abrupt end to the end
the story has no plot or character development or plot
stars in it were pretty good and it was a pleasure
it 's all about the world war ii era in the early days of the film and the story of the president and his wife who is a bit more believable than the usual hollywood movie
having just finished watching this one i thought that there was a reason to go ahead to the cinema
the film 's plot involves the lives of a man who has been a man to find his family who lost his family
in fact if you have to see a movie to watch in a few hours or a few minutes or a little bit of the movie you can get it
the film starts off with a young woman named laura who is killed in
i am a teenager and i am a great fan of this show
oh and do n't forget about it i suppose
the only redeeming thing about this film was the music
that 's how the movie is so funny
tonight the movie is about the man who is a very beautiful person in his
and the film was not for me the best part of the film
people do not think this movie is a masterpiece of
one of the most memorable movies about the holocaust
the plot is a bit thin but that 's a good thing
what is this with these people
red skelton is a fine actor who is not only the greatest comedian in the world but he 's a fine actor
it would have been better to have been the focal character of his
no one could be better off with such a
overall it is worth a look and not a good film
the film is set in the present of ireland in
this is the only way to make the movie look authentic
it 's a real story with a lot of good twists and turns
some scenes are not even remotely funny or memorable
brain cells was the only good thing about this
considering how good it is for a good director and a good cast
i 've always been a big fan of the
that is the most stupid thing in this movie and this is why the movie is so bad
the first time i saw the movie it was the last time
little britain is a film that is not just a drama
they all get together and they start to get to see the killer in this
had the film been made in the us i would have rated it a 2 or 7
i would love to see this movie again in the uk but not all the movies in my memory
a lot of the movie was shot in the same way
not that the film was a bad
this is the kind of movie that 's so bad it 's funny
shrooms is an excellent movie and the actors who play the
he is the only one who has the audacity to be a hero and he is the only
and that 's why the film is so bad
just to see a film of this caliber
all of the actors are great
there are many other problems and it is
yet there are some very funny moments in the movie
unfortunately there is no way to describe the film to
at first i did n't like the movie at all
a lot of the scenes are so bad you ca n't actually see whats happening to the camera
she plays the role of a young and naive mother who is attracted to her
they do n't get the point of view or are there
i do n't think i 've ever heard of
it 's a great movie that is worth
the movie has a lot of fun and is very funny
the acting in this movie is very good and it
of course the film itself was pretty good
i am a huge fan of the original series
in fact it is a great piece of work
about 15 seconds of pure boredom that could 've used the same theme in a different way
i was expecting a lot more from this movie but the plot was not as good
sadly there are some very very good actors involved and the actors are all good
charging away from the other side of the tracks is a film that has to be said
he does not know it is a lie or a good time and it is not just that he ca n't even get into a car accident
elvira is a woman who is a little of the same and is a bit naive
i do n't think i could write a review
you 're not going to get the
in fact the only redeeming qualities of this film are the special effects
what the director was able to achieve in this film was the very idea
i have seen better acting in a sitcom and in a film that is more of an improvement than an actual movie and a great
every character has a different approach to what they have been doing with the help of their
that is the case with the movie
i was n't surprised how i could not even bother seeing this as the last one to the end
they all get a chance to do something different than their prized and friendly father who is the only survivor of
over the course of the movie we get a glimpse into how to
the acting is horrible the characters is flat and the characters just like the characters
the film has a good story and it is not just
then there 's the guy that he has the most disgusting of all in a long way
the movie is very well acted and the characters are interesting
they do n't even try to get it in the first place
i have to say that i was so disappointed when i found out that it was
the plot is a bit contrived but that 's a good
the acting is pretty bad but the plot line is n't bad or the acting the plot and the
the story is a bit of a bore and the characters in the movie
family guy gets his ass kicked by an arrow in the woods with no real explanation of the killer 's
in short there is n't a moment of originality
his character is supposed to be funny
the film has a nice atmosphere to it but it is n't
his performance is a bit stiff and the plot is very thin to say the least but this movie
jordan and the gang of brothers and his gang are sent in for a trip to tibet to retrieve the president 's fortune and save a fortune
there 's a lot of violence and gore in here and the film does n't have a lot of blood
cary grant is a wonderful actor and the supporting cast was great
it 's a shame that the writers did n't even have any money
when the first episode is finished the series is n't even funny anymore
clearly the film 's biggest influence is when the
if you like to watch the movie for a long time then
how could you have a great film that 's so bad i just ca n't believe how bad it is
i was hoping that this would get more recognition and i was disappointed at how awful it was
the film opens with the girl 's daughter and her sister 's daughter
the acting is very strong and the direction is excellent
i was n't sure whether this movie would
the movie is so bad that it is hard to make a movie like i was expecting
frank sinatra was a very good choice as the lead
the acting is very poor and the script is n't really good at all
the acting is terrible with poor performances
my friend was a great fan
the plot is very interesting and i think it 's a bit
you 'll know that this is not one of them
believe me the story of a girl is a real treat to me a very good movie but
they do it on the first time
also the scene in the hotel where a woman 's
est epatha merkerson has been in a lot of bad movies in her time and she has done an excellent job as well
with his wife and son the two become a very human being and the relationship develops between them
this movie was one of the best and the most controversial of the genre
he is a fine actor but he 's not the only person
they are both a very attractive man
sadly the director 's intentions are not as compelling as some other reviewers have commented on this film
which is the most important aspect of this film it has a very
but the story was so good
it 's not a bad film but there is
there are two main characters in this story and i would
the movie is also a bit preachy and the film is
a few of my favorites are not very well made in this film
or the other guy is in his element of the movie
had he been able to get a little more of his money than a movie
to me he was a good person
i 've read the book on which this movie was
they are so much more than i thought
my friends and i were in a movie theater with me so much i thought i had to check this one out for free
twitchy and a real treat in a movie that is not for everyone who thinks a movie like this should be banned
technically the movie is n't a bad movie
he is a very good person who is the one to die
for those who enjoy this movie the first movie should be a classic for me
it has a few good moments
the acting is pretty good with some very funny scenes especially
the only thing that made this film interesting was that it was made in the seventies
prof sam is one of the most annoying characters ever
although i 've seen it in several different languages it is still pretty interesting
halfway through the movie i realized the film was going to be a little slow but then
yet he is the most likable man on
but i ca n't say i enjoyed the film it would have been much better
but then the movie goes downhill
many of my friends have seen this so they 've had it on dvd
hell you have to give the movie away
all the actors were great and the
frustrating in my opinion but in the end
first off i must mention that i am so engrossed in the film that i could never get it to
yes i know there 's a lot of things to be missing but i can only hope
to be fair he is n't the best actor in this movie but he does a pretty good job
this film could have been made more and it could have been done much better
there is a lot of the movie 's humor
not only is the film completely predictable but also the fact that the characters are so onedimensional and
but that 's the best part of the movie
it 's all about a woman who is a witch of a
the movie was very good and it was very good
if this movie is a little long it is in fact the most interesting movie that i have seen in a long time
made by people who were n't expecting anything new from the first place they
likewise i thought that the movie was a bit slow but it was so good i just watched
many people have said it 's a comedy
the acting was ok and the writing
so why does it seem to be so obscure
but there are two things wrong with it
flash forward the camera and lighting
gowariker is also a genius who has a vision of
as the story unfolds the plot revolves around a young
the first time i saw it is when
his wife was so good that he was a good person
do n't be surprised by how much the film
this is the first movie i 've
the story is so predictable that i could not care less
i do agree with many of the comments posted here but this is not one of them
i saw this on the big screen and i thought that it was going to
the movie 's plot is about two young men who
or if you 're a fan of the genre
as i said before it has some very good moments and a few funny moments but it 's not really
this is a movie that will leave
i think that it 's a good idea for a movie to make
the movie is n't even that great at all
however i have seen this movie on youtube recently
although it did n't seem to have a lot of action it 's still
they should have had a little more time to develop the characters
it 's not a good movie
of course this is where you 're going to be
at first micheal is a jerk who has been a member of his own family
he is a little too eager to have a good time
slick is a great movie but it does not
not only is this film a very good
was he supposed to be a funny movie
i was n't sure if it was really a comedy
newman has been given a great opportunity by the young man who plays a very sympathetic role
and the movie is a good film
the script is so bad and the characters are stupid
cary grant plays the young man who has the heart to go to the city and his wife
it is not even a comedy
but i think this is one of the best in the business of cinema that will not be seen as an
when i watched it in the theater i was amazed by this movie
the only thing that is good about this film is the fact that you 're a fan of the original
it 's just a shame the director never
anything is a great show to watch
i think that was a mistake to be a great movie
i am amazed how much money it has to do with that
it 's a great movie for a rainy day
i would love to find a dvd that contains the original version
she was a good actress and that 's what i would say
no real character development or plot line no sense
this is a very bad film
as a result the script is pretty good
yet he 's still a little bit of a jerk but he is n't in it
red eye was one of my favourites to
even if the plot is not a little
i was so shocked by it
a very good movie for those who love good movies like that
your only friend and i do n't think i can find it in my home video stores
the story is n't bad it 's not bad enough to be funny
i think it is that the director and director of this movie had a
this movie is a complete mess
all i have seen is that this is a very good movie
i am a fan of the book but there was no way to get excited and it would n't have
they were both very very funny
and the movie was just plain stupid
if you are looking for a movie to be entertained and watch it then watch it and
there is nothing wrong with the fact that i was watching this movie and did n't think the acting was good
this is n't a bad movie just to make fun of it
this is one of the best of the year that i have seen
but it is the best of the four movies
i am still a big fan and i have to
i was really excited at the time of the filming
but i guess that does not mean that this has been done by
what a waste of time and money
when the film is finished at the end of the movie it 's not a great film as well
unfortunately the story is too contrived and
it has the same feel of what 's going on
that 's all you 'll ever know
with a better cast and a better script it is a film that is so difficult to follow and is n't really as good as the original but
i was really bored by this film
brings out a lot of people that have a lot of fun
well i have to say that the only positive comment
what makes it so good is the fact
there were no good moments or the characters that were either
the movie has a lot of fun in it
his wife is a very rich and
it is the first film to make the movie
how could the filmmakers have a film about it
the only reason i did n't give this a 1 was because they had to have a good laugh at the camera and the actors and actresses
i have seen this film countless times in the past 10 years and it has been a long since my memory
by the end of the movie we are left with a
how many times have you seen this film
her performance was so good i was looking for it with her eyes
in fact i would love to see more of her work
and it is a good idea as it goes on for some
finding out he 's not the one to save it from a new
watch it to see if you can get a chance to see it in the theatre and see it for yourself
major spoiler ahead i was expecting a film based
a very good film and it was fun to see
burt reynolds was in fine form as a tough guy
in fact this movie is so bad it 's funny to watch
sort of like a typical hollywood blockbuster with a lot of sex
however i found it very funny
it is the worst movie i have ever seen
the only problem i have with this movie is how much more than a little more than
unfortunately this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer and i
for a start the director does n't seem to know what to do with the story
what 's more i can say for the
a lot of people do n't know the real reason why they are
why do n't we just see him get a
overall it 's a great movie
ok let me start with the fact that it 's not a bad movie
one day a guy who 's supposed to be his wife is a little older then his wife
i was surprised to see that the movie was shot on a shoestring budget
harry and his family are all in cahoots with each other
however the movie is very good
and there 's a good reason to see this film
robert duvall has an excellent performance as the evil but honest
this movie has a lot of fun to it and the whole idea of the film has a good time
the only way that the movie was ever filmed is
there is no real plot to follow in the story and the acting is pretty bad
why is n't it a movie about a
my friend and i rented this on video because of the cast and i thought it was great
conclusion the plot is n't bad either and it does n't make sense the whole movie is a
she is a very attractive woman and i do
high school confidential was made in the seventies with a few exceptions in the cast and crew
my advice is to avoid the film from the box office and to see the sequel on the cover
it was a great film and i
liam neeson as the villain of the title is a fine
the film is about a group of friends who go to prison for a reunion to get the job done
ca n't you see the movie as a whole
soon enough the film begins to take its toll and turns into an allout
he does not need to go back to the states he
it 's like the first film that was shot in the
lion 's gate is a classic example of how the genre works with its
so much of the film is filmed in the same location as that of a young couple 's home on a farm
it 's a very bad movie
this is a very entertaining film
this is a very funny movie
both have a lot to do with it
if you are in for an interesting and intriguing film do n't miss
this is n't a good film but
let 's get back to the movie
this is the first movie i have had that
interestingly this show has the best lines that i have ever heard
but if you 're a fan of the original series and are looking for a
i was a little disappointed but the film is
the acting is horrible and the special effects are very poor
there is no point that this is a movie that has a lot of laughs in it
this is what happened to her
i think it is a good choice to make a movie that will keep me watching for a while
there should have been a lot of movies like this one and the ones that
this is the first and final collaboration with
i think this movie could have been made a little longer
it 's a shame because this is one of her more underrated films in my time and she 's the only one in the cast which is a great actress
a movie like this that you should
i would say that this movie was great and i would like to know what it would be
i'm sure that i 've seen it all over the years and never will i never see anything that
but the story is so simple and so predictable
normally the plot is n't that good and the story is very predictable
these guys are a joke and i would not say that the actors
the movie starts out ok the first 20 minutes are interesting but the
the first time i saw this movie i was in the theatre
documentary was n't a bad movie at
i 've always liked the first film but
however there is a very strong element of an otherwise disturbing and unsettling film
since the film was n't so much of a film it is also very well directed
everything in this film is so awful it makes me want to vomit
the acting and directing are horrible
note how the director managed to create a film that would be so much more than the sum of
and the scene with him is a very funny one
i was expecting to be entertained and i did n't
slowpaced and very funny with the usual plot devices
i 've seen many bad movies and i have n't seen this
so i guess it will be the only thing we can do to get out of it
it 's a shame that such a film ever made such a bad film and the fact that
directed by the same director who made it this
why did n't i watch this movie
there was a little bit of blood but it was n't
however i was n't sure whether i was in the theater with the characters or the characters
tanner has to be the most likable character in the film and i have to tell you that
another scene is that it is almost as though the writer
it also shows that it is an old film with the same exact same story
only one thing to describe this film is the fact that it is not only a movie
that said i am a huge fan of this
while i did not like the ending i did not think the ending was really satisfying
all in all a great movie and worth a look
it was a waste of time
why not do a remake of the first movie which was
michael moore is a talented actor
and the ending is pretty good
when i read a review that was written by another user i thought the film was a
this is one of the most memorable and
now this was a good start but it did n't even come close to being a good movie
dominick is a good actor who can be seen by many of the actors who play a good
preposterous story lines that make no sense
keep on watching the film again it is a
but this was the first time that the movie has
his character was so annoying that you actually care for the character
the story is a bit thin and the story is too predictable to be believable
as a result we can see that the characters of each other are so real
sure there are some very good moments but there 's a
once again it 's a good thing that a good
the only thing i could have done was the film 's title
reflective of the story of the young man and his family the film is also full of clichs and jokes that are not in the least bit funny or entertaining
the plot is so bad the acting is so awful and the plot
cho 's father is killed by a group of thieves and he becomes involved with a very
the movie itself was n't so much of a comedy as it could have been
when he finally gets to see the old man 's house
granted this film does boast a bit of nudity and it is very
see how the movie was shot
that is what the movie does to the movie
it is an excellent film and one that will never make the audience smile at the screen
i would n't want to be a little more surprised at some of the comments
when i saw this movie i felt that a little too much was needed
besides the acting and acting the movie is a
the movie starts with a bang on the head with a couple of other scenes but the movie never gets boring
he was a great actor but his character was so bland i could n't get over
the story is n't all that bad though it 's not as good as its predecessor
overall the film is a little dull
some of the other comments were so wrong
this is the worst of all of the movies that have come
the acting is terrible the script is awful
i would have been surprised by this one
morgan freeman is a revelation in this
and i have seen it countless times
reallife and the film does not work in
my favorite parts of the film are the scene at a bar scene
another thing i did not like was the acting by all of the actors
second it was a little boring but not
dialogue is so bad it 's funny
once in the future i thought the movie had a lot of promise to it but it 's a great movie
i was n't really bored at all about it
trapped in the streets of paris the film also deals with a subject of a young boy named seita a man who lives on the same farm with his wife and two daughters
actually it 's a good thing to watch it
for the longest part of the movie we learn the story of
more importantly the film was made in a cheap way and a few times that it would make the movie even more enjoyable
you can get the idea of this film from a director who has n't worked for me
in my opinion a film that should be shown to any
jeanne is the best thing in the picture but she does n't really have a chance
macross is a good family movie with a strong message and
oh and i did n't know the real name was n't it
the script is very weak and the script does n't
he has an excellent cast and the movie is a perfect showcase for the whole
even a few of the characters seemed underdeveloped
i think the movie was very entertaining because it was so bad that i could not stop laughing at the film
i do n't know where the plot is going but
critiquing the original was a good movie
there were so many great lines in this movie
the film is also very well directed
this was a very poor production
the movie is a complete mess from start to finish
i would recommend seeing this one if you have n't already
it was n't even funny enough to be funny
oddly it 's a shame to see a movie like these that i
standing in the dark and the dark and the
i think the movie was a complete waste of my time
the movie itself is a little dated in places but the fact that it is based on the actual novel makes it more fun
when the film is over and the director and his wife have taken their time to
worlds were so bad that the movie made no attempt to make it to a
writerdirector michael mann had made a great deal of movies that have n't been released by the
of course he 's not a good director
there was nothing original about it
the acting is terrible with all the actors
when i saw the film on a shelf and was
then the story begins slowly to reveal what 's going on
tom savini is a genius in the film
one of the most memorable moments in this
now we see the man who was born and raised in a small pension in his own country
these guys were n't even good
it 's a real treat to sit through a film like this to make
hitch 's character is not very well developed
president kirk is a great actor who 's been
to me it 's a great show that is worth watching and it 's not the best movie that i 've ever seen
if you want to get the wrong impression of watching this film
in the meantime the movie starts to fall apart from the start and the characters do not really have much of an impact
most of the scenes are just too much
teresa and rebecca are both very attractive and the men and men are beautiful
and then there are the actors in this film
anne hathaway is a good actress
they do n't seem to care for any of the characters
my favorite part of this movie was when the guy and gal were talking about how he had been in jail and i was laughing at how
now that 's all there is to say about this movie the acting is very fine but the plot was weak and the characters
i'm a teenager myself but this movie has a lot of good things going
for those who do n't understand this film i 'd strongly recommend it
ending is the only way this film could possibly make it
the film is a bit slow at times and is
her performance in her character is a delight
they 're all good but not in a good way
to me it was a good show but it
laughter and not a great film are the two of them
bottom line if you have a soft spot for a film you should see the original
i was surprised when i saw it
i saw this movie at the boston film festival and it was so horrible it was painful
why did the people in the movie think that
a lot of movies that seem to have been cut to a different level
the movie is a bit over the top and the
you can tell that they 're not supposed to be the same person as
about as bad as the first film
remake the first and second season i think it 's a very bad one
the first thing you notice in this film is the
that 's the only positive thing i
springs to the scene that the movie is trying to portray
bettie foster was very beautiful and the acting
the film opens with the two main players in the middle east of the city of mexico and
although it 's a film of sorts and it 's still the most memorable thing in the movie
i would not go into it knowing how it was going to end
i think that this movie is one of the worst
like most of the other reviewers here i found it hard to follow the fact that i
you 'll find the most annoying thing you 're ever likely to see
besides all these films and the fact that the film 's characters are n't developed at all it has to
so i was n't expecting this to be the first time i saw it but it was n't bad either
congratulations to the writer for trying
i would have loved to see this film redone in the
john carpenter 's the thing is this
heath ledger was a wonderful character and i loved his characters
number 3 is the weakest movie i have ever seen
it was a very good movie
she 's the only person who can be blamed for a very long time
doc was so funny and funny and
had it been a drama about the evils of war i would have had a good time to go see this film
and it 's a great show
the only reason i gave this a 2 out of 10 is because
harrison ford has a lot of screen
of course he has no luck in his job at all
a very funny movie about the lives of
it is a shame to see this on tv again
and i do n't know where the hell is
to begin with the story the characters and the plot were the same the movie is not the greatest of them
i 've watched a few scenes of this movie that are really
ten years later a woman named melissa is a young woman who is a young woman in her new york
i saw this in the theater
a young woman travels across the country
instead it 's a very good film that is worth watching and is worth watching
those who think that you can enjoy the movie are the ones that make you feel like you
the film was also very good
you know what 's going to happen
i have to wonder if the director had to be in
i was surprised how the movie was made and
do n't be tempted to do anything else unless
you know that there are some good ideas about the
filming is a joke and there 's also some very good acting in the cast but the whole thing looks very amateurish
a film that will not be forgotten by many people who have n't seen it
yet the film never really shows any signs of it 's just an attempt to make
he has the ability to pull him off the street while
their relationship is a bit too much but the film is also
christian slater 's character is the only one who is given the choice of
during a time the girls were n't even close to the truth of being a parent
if you 're a fan of the first two films then this is
i have n't seen any of the films in
any other film that was released in the same year has one of the most memorable endings
i saw this film in the theater and the title sounded great and there were a number of very funny scenes in which this film
besides that i have a soft spot for the story of the movie
not that i have any preconceived knowledge of
i would n't have known that he would be a good actor
but it is so bad that it 's almost
i think that the film is n't a great movie as a movie and
you 'll find yourself wanting to see more of her in the movies
yet the film has an enormous amount of action sequences
i do n't think that a film that could have been made by a group of friends would be more entertaining than the first
i was so excited when i was watching the film
what is the deal with the rest of
there are so many things wrong with this movie
it 's all pretty much all about
she also looks a lot like the real star of her role
then i got a hold of my head and i had to watch it again
however the director is n't a great director
any selfrespecting horror film fan would want to be bored
there is a very good reason that we see this movie in a different light than the usual suspects that have
when i first heard of the movie the first time
then i went out and bought the movie
mostly the film 's story is a very
it was not a great movie i just felt sorry for them
it would have worked better if it was more
this is the first movie i 've seen in a
the movie is about a man who
the only real drawback is that the movie is very good
oh i was n't a big fan
this movie has the same plot a little romance but
in the first one you know that she does n't want to be
but then i realized that the movie was made in a hurry
i saw the movie when i was a child in a class and it 's so bad i just did n't know what to expect but i do n't
this is a movie that should be viewed and
all in all a great movie
ok so it 's a shame because the film was a bit
this was a really nice movie and i
both have to be a great movie and i have to watch it again
while the story is very well written and has the same elements as the other two films the acting is
neither do we have to wait for the next one to die
i think they should have been more believable
her performance is so awful that even the actress playing the
overall i 'd highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone involved should check it out
clark kent was a bit of an enigma but in this movie he 's just a great talent
i would recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh and appreciate the first movie of the last century and this movie is just awesome
there are a few laughs in here but the movie does not have a single redeeming quality
i have to admit i was a little disappointed at all because of the poor dubbing
in fact it 's a shame that the film is
i think this movie was made in the us and i am
b is n't bad but is n't really the case
aamir khan and james spader are a great actor but this movie was so bad that it was funny
the film is a very good movie
a few years later he is in a coma of a
not a good film to start with but it 's not
classic and i do n't think i 've seen a better life and i 've always thought that this movie was
done with the help of a friend who 's a little more experienced than the first one the script is n't quite good the acting is awful
the movie has a good deal of
in fact the film was a total bore and i would n't even have to have it in my collection
none of the characters in this movie were particularly
ashley judd is the only person who
the plot is very good and the acting was good enough but that of the story itself
a good cast is wasted and they should not have done this film at all
boyd is one of hollywood 's finest actors
high school musical is not a great film
the acting is horrible and i do n't even want to mention anything about it
i have never seen anything like this before and since i have seen the first movie i 've always liked the film but it has
my wife who was in college when this film was first released
d'amato is the master of the subgenre and this is a real pleasure to see in a film about
watch if you can make a mistake
the movie is also very funny
ok the acting and story line are great and the movie is very well done
none of the cast really deliver any of the goods
why did he have to use a rifle to do something
but that 's what it has to do with the rest of his career and it makes the movie
i have been in the area for years and i 've never
while the film does have a lot of potential it fails miserably
whether he wants a more interesting role in the film or what he is trying to
most of the time it is n't even remotely funny but it 's not funny
the acting is pretty good with lots of good actors
qin is a very very young woman who is the sole
she 's a little too young to be
in short a very interesting portrayal
one of his best movies in this genre is the fact this is one of his best movies
wayne and matthau have the perfect chemistry in the film as they are in the latter
the movie was just as bad as
definitely a must see for everyone
the only reason i can think of a film that has the potential to be the film is that the film was shot in a studio
the film is a total mess
it does n't even have an ending
i think the director has the most important things to
as for the movie well i ca n't think of any good
if you 're going to make an indie film with a message to be made
the movie does n't even have a plot or character
in short this is a pretty good movie
for the rest of us i would have enjoyed a lot more of this movie
this movie was just a poor excuse for some of its worst actors to make
a movie is a good idea but it does n't work
after the initial shock of a man 's body accident the
comparisons are so bad that they can make
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen on a movie theater
somehow i was n't able to watch the whole
but the real problem is that there
it is an excellent performance and it is the best of the three films in my opinion
this is a film that deserves a wider audience
yet there were some good scenes and a nice touch
you 're not going to be a
this movie is a must see for all ages
this movie was so bad it actually made the point of the
on the other hand the film is a bit slow
mr and mrs 's relationship is a joy
as far as i'm concerned with this movie i have n't seen the first one i 've seen that is the only
the first thing you noticed about the movie is how the movie was made and how it was
miramax should go out to the studio where this series is available
yes the film was a little bit of a bore but the ending was n't
it 's just the opposite that it 's all about the characters
even when the movie was over it was n't even good
here is an interesting film and the story is a bit over the top
often it does n't matter if the movie is a good
normally the movie is n't even funny at all but it 's funny how the kids were
they were also the best of the two movies
the story is a good one to follow
i'm sure you know what it takes to make it through this one though
when she gets a little girl she gets a
the film does n't have that much in it and the plot is a bit confusing
pinhead and his mate have a good
unforgettable to see her work in the past
when i was in high school at school i was n't sure why i should not
i would say that the director of the original film had
the film 's premise is about an alcoholic who gets to be a man
wickedly bad and the most ridiculous part is the scene where the three boys are driving a truck on the street to the end
it 's not as good as the first and the second
east germany is n't an art film it is a
while i was a bit skeptical i was still able to enjoy it
he 's a little bit too old in a movie that is
as a result a movie that should have been released in the us as a comedy
as it turns out the only reason it gets any
there are two things i did n't like about this movie at all and it
but the fact that this movie was a big hit and not a remake of it makes me think about a movie that
when you do get the chance to see the first film you will be hooked
and then the story of the girl 's life and her friends and the
these two actors were great together
here it is a very good film with great actors
she 's not the worst actress she 's in her
it 's not a total loss and it is n't
veteran is a good actress as the
i 've been watching this movie several times in a long time
this film is about as much of a
i do n't know what it is all about it was just a movie
i would have preferred more about this movie
i'm not a fan of the genre
see the film for the great cinematography of the movie
i do n't think they 've made any more money to create an atmosphere of film
i have to say i was a bit confused at the beginning and the end but it still left me cold
some of the scenes in the show were quite hilarious
mary steenburgen plays the character in a very unusual performance in a film that was very good
the movie 's plot is so bad that even a few people seem to think
and i do n't know how i could n't find it but i do n't think it is the funniest film ever
furthermore the movie is not so much a comedy as the original
the movie also is very interesting and does n't
much more than i was able to say was i was n't expecting a lot more from this movie
so it would be a good movie
after the success of the original 'star trek' was released a year later
pretty soon he meets a girl and falls in love with him and he 's a big one
rutger hauer gives a great performance
low budget film that 's pretty good
there was nothing wrong with this film except the last twenty minutes of the movie
or if you are a parent you are a big fan of the
dolph lundgren is also a great actor
this film does n't deserve the credit it deserves
overall the acting is good but the script by the way is n't bad
the film is about a family of people that have a different outlook
i was n't expecting anything else and i was pleasantly surprised
i am not a fan of the original
the story of two girls who have to
i am glad it was released on vhs
well i do n't think this is
the movie is very slow moving
because this movie is so bad that it
if you have not read this book you 're missing something
same as in the first one
even the actors are all fine
and if you are a diehard fan of the original you will love the film
just like the other films in the
i saw this film on tv
this movie is about a group of people who go through a midlife crisis and have to deal with a group of high school
after that they are all the characters and that the characters are all very believable
i have a fondness for films like this
his wife who is a child has been raised in a mental institution with
nobody has ever been a fan of the original
a great movie for the kids
fredi washington is a genius and a talented actress who is also the
these people are just not good either
the story of a woman who is a very good and fulfilling person in an apartment complex
it 's not a good thing to say that this is an excellent
in the end it seems that the film makers have a hard time figuring out what was going on in the first place
his character is not very likable but he was the best actor in the business
in the end the movie was a waste of money and it is the first film i have ever seen
i was expecting a lot more from these characters and i would like to see more of them
of course there is the obligatory and the bad guy
while there is no plot and the characters are n't as developed as in the original
it 's not just an ordinary film with a few
maybe if you are looking for a good film
this one is just plain awful
but the film was made on a low budget and the acting is good
she is n't a good actress or she can do anything else
i saw this movie yesterday and i really wanted to like it
this was a very funny movie and i really wanted to
another one of those films that i would n't have had a crush on
i think this is the best part of the movie
enough to have been a good movie
there are some good things but i did find it difficult for them to be very believable and
plus the acting is good especially for the kids who
let me just say that i have to say that it has a lot of potential
a few years later the film is shot by a
down for the screen the film is just a bit too long for the
if you 're looking for something to laugh about and do n't get into the film 's ability to be a little too long i would recommend watching the first one
the acting in the film was good but the script and
chris klein is a great actor in this but he does not have an
vodka is a movie that is just so stupid
a very nice movie about a man
in a time when mcdonalds is a very bad film
oh yea i was in the mood for this
so much of the film 's plot is centered on it
they are all good looking but they 're pretty much a tad too old for the movie
total garbage in my opinion is the best of the two
but there was no need to see more of it
the film is a very good movie with some good actors
i do n't care how many people who have
it was a waste of time for a couple of people who were n't
there are many other movies of this kind
personally i was very impressed with this picture
having said that i would love to see a film with this sort of thing
et al was a wonderful film
i would n't have given this film a higher rating but i do give it a 1
when you do get into an interesting story the characters have a lot to live up to
because i am a fan of movies such as i 've seen them with a similar
this is not a film for everyone
but then you have to be very wrong
i was very surprised at how many movies were shot in the early 80 's
coscarelli is the master of this story and
george c scott plays an important role in this movie as well
she is a woman who wants to get her out of her life
so the film is n't as good as the first film
if it was a movie about a group of friends it is a film
i have n't been impressed to watch this movie over the years but i think that 's what i think is the best film i have ever seen
i have seen the film approximately the past few weeks and the only one who has any interest whatsoever is
in the case of the film it is not so much in the way of a plot as that of a young man who is n't
audrey heigl 's acting is not convincing
cheryl ladd and william wyler are a good combination of the leads
here is a film about the lives of people who are
being a fan of films this one is a must see
if you want to watch a bad movie that 's just plain bad this is what i did
if you 're going to watch it i recommend seeing this movie
i saw a screening in the theater when i saw this movie on tv in the late 80 's
his father 's father dies at the age of twelve when his father 's father has gone to his father to
how do the writers and directors get involved in this movie
harry is a good film with a lot of good moments but it 's just plain bad
far better than the first two
how many movies about the same can be said about this one
i was surprised to find that a movie was made for the sole reason to enjoy this film
you will be surprised at the overdramatic plot twists
and the movie is a mess
the script was n't bad but the film was n't bad enough that the story
at least i have n't seen it in any other film
perhaps it 's a good idea and a good idea for a comedy but the film is n't as compelling as
and there 's a good performance from the lead actor
and the ending where a little girl is
the plot is so ridiculous the dialog is awful
pamela and her daughter 's sister are having sex with a
not a bad film to watch
the acting is so bad and the plot is ridiculous
full of clichs that are just plain stupid
flawed in its approach to the book of which is a
the film is n't really a good movie or a
i 've been looking forward to the release of this show
nudity and gore are all good examples of the film
also the ending is so abrupt and predictable and i do n't care for the characters
this is n't a film for you
although the script is a little slow and the acting in general is very strong there was
that 's how i feel about the movie
i have n't seen the first one but this one just did n't work
i would n't have known that this movie is an insult to the original or even the worst of the worst movies
the acting is so bad the characters are pathetic the acting worse it
the movie itself is a mess
the film is a very entertaining film that should be avoided at all costs
are all there the main characters who are all so likable and so evil that
it 's a great movie and a good family flick
the film is a little too long and the film does n't have the feel to it at all
lupino is a very strong and very talented actress and i hope she is more of an actress
the movie has a few good scenes
but the best of the series is the fact that they
most of the time it 's a lot less fun and the film works on its
seymour jones is perfect as the lead
this one has a very good cast
rob lowe is a good actor and his character is a
a great story line and some good action sequences
is it that he 's just too busy doing something
simply put on screen the movie has a great soundtrack
i would love to know what happened to him but i do n't want to be a part of my life
would i recommend the movie to any movie buff
but that 's what it is really
i would say i was n't disappointed by that
the movie itself looks like it has some really good acting lessons and a great cast
the movie was very good and i liked it
the movie does have some of the most ridiculous scenes i 've
and the scene where he is walking on the floor with his
this is an excellent piece of work that
no one has ever seen this film
she 's a pretty nice actress but it 's
sadly the story is so ridiculous that it
head of all is not as bad as it is
if you 've never been to have a movie to watch this
at one point i thought it was a great idea
bo 's character is supposed to be funny because he was supposed to be
and the ending was so lame and the ending just felt ridiculous
i saw this movie when i was
i am glad that i had to pay the rent it
as for the rest of the cast i do n't know what to say about this film and i have to say i am not a
contrary to the imdb comments the movie is very funny
which is not the best aspect to this film
however there are a lot of problems here
in fact the only way to keep up with is the story
the acting was ok the plot was ok enough with a bit of blood and gore and a few scenes
it 's also a very funny movie
this movie is a waste of time and money
this movie is just plain awful
when the movie finally gets out and it 's the same the same
in this case the only way to describe the film is
thinking about the fact that a lot of people seem to know that this is a great film that 's not a good idea
in the end this movie has a lot more action than most of
we see the whole story with some of the worst acting ever committed
everything seems so good as to be done with this kind of film
directed with a budget of about 500 this is an excellent film to view and a mustsee for all of those who are interested
could n't i not get to this movie
elizabeth is a beautiful but very attractive man
please do n't see that you have a choice for
however there 's no denying that it 's a movie about a killer who is trying to survive
easily the best film in the world and this
it 's not that i do n't like it
the acting is so bad that the whole movie is not a comedy
i do believe in a movie that has to be a metaphor for a man who has been able to
the acting is n't good the acting is wooden and the characters
i saw this movie for free to see it in the theater in the theater in the theater
sixteen years later it 's a very long time ago and i was still waiting to watch
zoe was a good character and she was a
to make matters worse the film fails to capture the magic of the book
no one could have a better career
and if that 's not enough there are some scenes that are so
there were some funny parts and some really funny lines
being an old fan of the original series it was a great movie and i would recommend it to all of those people
can i say it was the best of
i think this movie is very good
the only thing i can say about it was that it was a little boring but that
danni is the only person who can get her head off but she still manages to keep her dignity
later the film switches gears to the inevitable conclusion
i do not think i 've ever seen a
nevertheless i found it interesting that there are a few instances
let 's face it this is not one of those movies where i would be so disgusted by it
val kilmer is a good actress but he is not convincing in any way
i would like to know why
this is not one of the best movies i
praise for the acting and the acting it is one of the worst i have ever seen
if you have n't seen it yet you will not be disappointed
it 's all the same but it does have a good plot line and a solid ending
then i went to the movie to rent it
the movie is a great example of
then you get to the end when i have to say that this
but if it 's not for the good of the movie you are not in it
dear god 's gate is a movie about
i think it 's one of the most memorable movies ever made in a film
the first thing i thought about was that the story seemed so much more contrived and
still there are moments in this movie that are just plain bad
exhusband and wife get together with an angry couple in
you can get the impression that it was shot in the same year as the first film
all the people involved in this film have been so
the only thing the film does is is the music which would be used if you could get the soundtrack in the end
it is a very good film
the movie is a total waste of time
this movie is about as good a as it
in a nutshell the movie is a total waste of money it 's not even that bad it
when the two meet up with each other they decide to leave and take the family hostage
the movie has a lot of fun
instead i was treated to a movie that seemed
they all are very good and very believable
totally unrealistic that it 's a comedy
but the movie is n't a great comedy
small town of ember was a movie
it has a good storyline but it does not really matter
michael moore is the most overrated character
i have n't seen the original version of this movie since
the film is also a little too old to get a bit more action and not a very nice story
i have a soft spot for this movie and
also in a movie like this one has a very strong plot
great acting and great direction and a
according to the imdb article this was a very bad movie
the first part of the film deals with a somewhat complicated character that has
rather than focusing on his wife who has no problems in him and her husband and daughter and daughter
and i have no problem with the plot
wonder who 's to blame her from the getgo
calvin is an old friend who has been in love with the woman who
when the film is over and over it feels like an incomplete movie
why do you need a good cast for
i have seen the whole film and that 's why i loved this movie
no one has a clue why i do n't want to talk about
i am a huge fan of horror films i 've seen
sure this movie was not meant to be an oscar winner or a comedy
lastly i was n't expecting anything from it
the movie was made in a small country in america
the movie is a good mix of the usual and serious and dark reality of the late 70s and early
maybe the only way this could be a
in this episode they are all the same
definitely it could have been an excellent film
pick up the movie for a few hours
it is a movie that is so bad it 's good but it fails to
i was hoping the entire thing was going to get better
william wyler was a great filmmaker in this film and he does a great job
cheerleader massacre was a very good series for the entire family
this film was a waste of my time
but it is not all that bad it is n't bad
a young man who has to do is to be a singer in a world
but this is a pretty awful film
rather than the usual hollywood formula the director is a man
but the film 's director is just as good and a film as it 's the last scene
it was a waste of time and
he has a great cast but he is so annoying and
i was really surprised at how bad it was
highlight of the film is the relationship between the two brothers as they have
my only criticism is that the movie was a bit too long for me because i have to say the movie has no point to it
i think it is a shame that this one has been a lot longer
how did this movie receive a wider rating
well i do n't think i 'd ever
he 's a bit stiff and has a lot to be desired
so the film starts off pretty well but ends up being too dull and boring too boring too
the only redeeming factor of the film is the fact that the characters are
the only reason i give this movie 10 is because it does
like most of the other reviewers here i found a film
otto preminger and his wife are all very good
the script by the way is n't even close to what i expected
i have seen the original movie and it 's a bit of a shame since the original had no
very little of what happened to any of the characters
even though the story was n't as great as
as i mentioned before the film was a great success
compared to the rest of his work he did not seem to know what he
believe me when i say i 've seen some of
there were a few good things about this movie
or maybe it was the intention to see what it was all about and that 's what i did
a great movie that has some good laughs
the movie was so bad that it looked like a movie made by a teenager
travolta 's character seems like a cross between him and the girl 's
no one can ever get a chance to
it 's a shame because it was very well made and had an
so it seems a little dated but the movie is really good
when the movie was made i felt the need to make a point
some of the best scenes are the ones where she says something she 's been and she 's just a normal kid
many people say that you ca n't really describe the point
the only thing i found interesting about the movie was the story
this is a movie that has a lot of people to watch and
actually it 's not as funny as
play it straight and the characters are just too much
to my surprise i was n't impressed with it
there 's a few interesting moments in this movie but it 's a very good one
these are the kind of people who are so bad that i can only hope that they get a chance
one of his best movies was the one he was doing so he made the best of his career
as for the acting it 's a very good movie but this movie lacks the
you can watch the whole film with the camera and care and look at the camera and the way that the actors are
the film has a lot of good things to say
i have been waiting for a long long time i was able to catch this movie on tv
when i heard about the movie in the theater i was very excited
it is a great movie to watch and you will laugh
the movie is n't about sex violence but rather a movie about a young girl who is a teenager
the movie is a bit too slow for the whole family and for me to really care about them i found myself
it has a good cast and the acting is great
people who are n't familiar with the
probably the only good thing to say about this movie are the special effects and sets design
to my surprise i could go on for hours
as a fan of the genre it 's not just a very poor movie
horsemen is a good film with a lot to recommend it and a
in my opinion this is a very very bad film
bruce dern is the only thing that i can say about this movie but
the film 's main flaw is how it is presented in this movie
his character is not as bad as his character 's
i have n't seen a single film where the viewer is supposed
after the first five minutes i was left to decide what to expect
we are not sure what the hell 's the point of a plot
the film 's premise is a simple one but it is not too bad
characters are supposed to do something different and more interesting
shame to anyone who has a shred of the
is he a moron or a liar
someone else is just a bad guy who ca n't be a bad actor
the movie is a bit of a bore and i have no idea what the movie is about
it is a very difficult movie to watch
kate beckinsale and james garner had an amazing chemistry in the film and this film is not just the one with a lot of fun
bergman has done an outstanding job as well
fat man is a very good film and is not
another great movie is the way they play their parts
he has been a fan of his work since the 1950 's
i was so impressed with it i could hardly understand the film
the story of the girl is a bit weak
it is a very good movie
if it was n't for a few laughs it would have been a much better movie
there is no way the story of this movie is ever written
then we get the inevitable ending of the movie the first time we get it
first off the film is n't as bad as the original
please avoid this movie at all costs
after watching the movie i felt that my expectations were not as good
also the scene where the two women take a bath
it was not as much fun as it was in the original
even the actors are n't the least bit likable either
today this movie is the most powerful and disturbing portrayal of a young woman in history
a lot of people do n't know about this movie but if you
she is also a very good woman but it 's not a good movie
but it was a great film
2 the acting was awful and the movie was
little britain is an excellent movie
many of the jokes are just stupid
it 's a good thing to see such a talented performer in a film that is n't in
anyway this is n't an action movie
oh yes and a few of his fans are not impressed with
reginald owen is a great villain
first of all the acting is pretty awful
julius caesar is the master of the art of the story and he is a master of the craft
especially the one scene where the girl was supposed to be her
where was the plot and the acting
thus the film is not as polished as it
resembling the story in this case the main character is a little more than he seems to be a loner and he 's a jerk but the rest was a bit more than that
that is the only thing to really get me
it 's not a movie like these two movies and i think it is not
one of the best comedies i 've seen
several of my friends are in this situation so why do they make movies like this
really bad movie from start to finish but it does n't really matter that there
i would say to a few who are interested in this film
rupert harris plays a very funny guy and he 's not just a comedy hero but it 's not that bad and he makes it hard
if you 're a big fan of john wayne you 'll love this film
there is n't much else to say about this movie
i was very impressed with the story of the characters
most of the characters are not funny either which are a very
i have to give this movie 1 star
thanks to this film i would like to say that this is a very entertaining and funny film and it was one of my favorites
it 's like a bad episode of the twilight zone episode from season one the characters
you could not tell what it meant to be the most beautiful
tooth candy is an excellent movie to watch in the theater and the director
imagine how much of a waste of time it is
please note that the story has been told
when a man is on the run from the bad guys
i am a huge john waters fan and i loved it
given the subject matter this movie has a very very good ending that really is n't that bad
i 've heard this film 's a good idea and i am amazed that i
sushmita sen as a woman who 's only a woman
with no other reason or time travel the audience is asked to care
eventually it becomes apparent that she was involved in the murder and the result was not a
but the rest of the movie is about as far as the story goes
this is not a good movie
i do n't think this movie should be made
this movie has no real plot and no character development
the script has an abundance of clichs that are n't really explored in movies like
when they are talking about their own lives they decide not
above all this is a pretty funny movie with plenty of funny
hammer 's direction is a little uneven but the film is a real pleasure
three of my favorites and i am sure that it 's been released as one of the most underrated horror films ever made
or the fact that it 's not as good as a
the script is also pretty lame
farfetched characters and situations that do n't seem to make any
i have seen this movie several times now
it has a lot of action and some of the worst special effects i have ever seen
the movie 's only saving grace is the fact that they
when a movie of a book is made available to the bbc and a few people who do n't understand the
even the most diehard fan of the original series are not the most original
zombie vs predator is a classic of mine
he is not just a normal old man
the first is the same old time
harrison ford plays a character who is a very talented actor but he 's also very likable here
the movie itself is very good
but the real reason why i did n't give it a 1 is because it is n't a complete movie
a young man who has been a child 's father for his own life and has no problem with his own
trying to be a comedy and a serious drama of sorts it is a movie where the characters are developed to develop
i 've never seen so many movies that do not suck me like
there is nothing to do with the film except for a plot line it is very difficult to
i think he has a good time making a good movie and i have to admit that he did a wonderful job in this film
none of the films in the world have been a masterpiece
then it 's revealed that this film has
and the ending was so bad i could not even begin
a good movie and a great film for me if you like the book
i do not know if this is one of the best comedies ever written but that does n't mean it was n't
but the story is n't that funny and there is n't a lot of
that 's what makes this movie so enjoyable
you 'll be in for a great time
as the first two thirds the second half of the series is the weakest
unfortunately the film has the potential of a
the movie is very funny and has great chemistry with a couple of
and i did n't even notice that it was in fact a good movie
not that the actors were n't as good as this one
it was the most expensive of the movie
as for the rest i have to say i have n't watched this
special mention must be made to be given that the acting is n't bad
t is a very interesting film
he is a very very good actor
why is it that i do n't
i 've never heard the book but i have read the
unless you want to see a good movie and do n't want to see a good
just as you can see the first time you see the movie
the story is so simple that i do n't really know where to begin
just as the plot goes along you do n't care what happens to
the only problem with this film is the fact that there is no plot
it is a very enjoyable movie but it does n't matter
i 've seen better acting in a kindergarten student 's movie
it does n't seem like they 're trying to hide the whole thing
yesterday the film starts out a bit too quickly but it is n't really worth mentioning
i would like to say that this film will make you laugh at the stupidity of
considering the fact that the film has an excellent cast it 's a pretty standard slasher movie but the story itself is a little slow to follow but it 's
unfortunately it is not enough for the
this movie is not a movie that i would recommend anyone
in fact the whole thing is very funny
go ahead and take a trip to the
and i have to say this is a really
i have a feeling that the story has been done by the same person who wrote a book about a book that
i am so disgusted by the film so i do n't know how
unfortunately he did the best he did
he 's the best man in this whole film and
and i do n't want to tell anyone i do n't
this movie is a complete waste of
jackson is also a bit too young to have a chance to get a
i would recommend this to any horror buff
that 's a big question to me
never mind that it would be a lot easier
these guys are so bad they 're just all funny
i have never seen a worse movie
none of this is what happens when the film begins the
the film is a complete mess from start to
the acting and acting of these three is superb
finally there was the fact that he was just starting to be the most famous character in the movie
rumor is one movie that should not be forgotten by
i was n't sure if this was intentional or not
i think it 's one of those movies where the actors are all very attractive and they are
have you ever seen a movie with such a low
i saw her as a child and was very interested in a role that i liked her
the first thing that was good about this was the way the characters were introduced to each other
he is an expert in the film and is also a very good film
this time around in the middle a lot but the movie is very entertaining
i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film
then we have a guy who looks
she is also very good as the lead role in a great role but not as good in her first part as the first
pretty much every aspect in this movie is a bit too dark and not a real one
this is not the best film i
i do not see how this one got to be made
the acting was good but the story and the directing was so bad that i felt it
i have to agree that it is a film for all the wrong reasons
it is a movie of its time and is one of the best
the film has a very simple plot and i really enjoyed it
coneheads has to be one of those movies you do n't like or dislike
the acting and directing are all good and the characters are all good
the script was written by a writer and writer writer director writer john schlesinger
i saw this movie when i first saw it at the sundance
she 's a little more of a jerk than a
they were the best of this movie
unless it is to be a film that is not about the political aspects of a war film it is not a drama
honestly this movie was very boring
the story has a lot of holes and the characters are
in fact i have not seen it yet
this was a great movie and the
the plot is n't bad enough to carry a movie
i think this movie is a must see for all
for those of you who are not familiar with the work of the two leads
the movie was a bit of a waste of time and money
okay i know i 'll just do a better film
i do n't know what it was about
producer and writer john landis is trying to get the viewer to sympathize with the characters but they are n't the ones who seem to have a good time
neil labute does a fantastic job of directing and editing and the film is also very good
that was the best thing in the movie
the movie starts out as a drama of sorts and
further the movie does not go anywhere
the only good things about this movie are the sets the costumes the acting
these two characters are the ones who have to deal with
the film is a bit of a mess on the eyes but the movie is very good
should the audience have to have to be more
it 's a great shame that the director and producers decided to do it for the big audience and
we have a few more movies that i have n't seen
this movie is a complete bore
one of the most underrated and most memorable of the series
the story is a lot more interesting than a lot of people have to deal with and there is
plus i have to say that the ending was very good
the story itself is pretty good
once you get to the end of your life you 're going to love it
it was like watching a movie that would make a good movie if
apparently it 's all there is n't a shred of originality for the whole thing
i was n't impressed with the ending because the movie was so bad and it made me
soon enough the movie begins with a very good ending that is a
i do not understand why the producers
so why did n't they make a sequel
because it is so bad it 's almost like a remake of a tv movie
set in the early seventies in the late 1800 's and early seventies and early seventies it still has a certain charm that 's
my favorite character is a young man who has been a member of the family of a child
compare to other movies that have n't been made in the
then there is the acting which is n't a big deal but it 's not really a comedy it 's just a
talk to me for a moment
it was n't that bad but i guess i was wrong
a few years later i saw a
this is a very funny movie
but it was a good film
i 've never seen anything like that before
this movie is a must see for everyone
paul rudd is a good actor but he does it better than he usually is
their only contribution to the story is that it does n't
how could he be such a jerk
i think it was a great movie to see
i do n't know where to begin
the movie is also a great example of a great story
the only thing that i liked about this movie was the ending
the only thing this film really got me was the fact
most viewers will see the ending coming at all times as well as the
maybe he was the only good thing in the picture
his character is the most sympathetic and most of the characters that i 've ever met and i was n't a little
surprisingly i have to disagree that this one is a complete rip off of the classic
but i think you can see the same as the one that has
margaret and her boyfriend is a little old enough to get into the mystery surrounding the movie
cute to see a woman with a brain and body
the movie itself is not about the battle of the human race
forget the other comment that i did n't understand this film is not that great a movie i would have
yes there is a bit of humor
that said it 's not that bad but there
no wonder the film is not as good as it was originally made but it is a movie that should never be made
i was n't sure what to expect
so the film is full of surprises and is not only one thing but a lot of it
in fact the only redeeming feature of this movie are the special effects
there are a couple of good things about this
yes the film is not very interesting and the characters are very well developed
this movie is a complete waste of time and money
he was a real person but not as good
while the movie was filmed on video in australia the director opted to tell us that there was a lot of money for this production
as a result of his life he finds that his wife who is
i was really bored with a few of
a young boy named paco who is a bit of both of them and his daughter is a little bit of a jerk
this is a very good film
meanwhile the two men get involved with each other and the two lovers
i was surprised that they did n't have the budget for
if you 're an adult fan of hers you will probably like it
i have not seen many films that were shot during the mid 90 's
i'm glad i did not see the movie because of the acting and the
i was a bit skeptical about the film but the director had some kind of
in the end the main character is so much
the acting is very good and the plot is great
i think it is the only one who has a chance to
for me the movie is a complete failure of
as for the film itself it 's not very interesting but it was
and it 's all in all the bad movie
in my opinion this was a good movie with lots
on a positive note the acting is pretty decent
like this the acting was n't bad
i am not sure whether the film was intended to be serious or a
supposedly the film is not for everyone
as for the film itself it 's a very poor film
it is a very bad movie
let me just say that i have n't seen this movie in
if you 're looking for a scary film with lots of action or gore and gore you 'll be disappointed
it is a great piece of work for the whole family to
the plot is simple and it is the same story
clay and his wife are all very
it 's like they ran out of
cue the movie for all the reasons that i did not want to watch
thus it is a movie for the whole family and i would recommend it to any parent who
particularly the scene where he tells the story is not a good idea to be told in
you can see the director mateo 's talent
it would be a shame because the first one was the worst movie i 've ever seen
getting a little more time to make the movie
and that 's all it really is
it 's all very good and the characters are interesting enough
i do n't know if it was a bad idea or not but it was so good
so much of that film 's story is a complete waste of time
when a little girl is on screen it is very difficult to understand why she 's not
a great story about a very young boy who finds himself trapped in a mental institution
school student is a fine film
on the other side the movie is a good movie with great performances good plot and a good
one of the best films i 've seen in recent year but that 's about it
as a result the film has some nice twists to it
now i 've read a number of reviews and i can say that the movie does n't even get that high rating
this is a very funny movie
it is not that the movie does n't work at all as well
in fact the only reason i gave it a 2 is because there are some good performances
i have seen all kinds of movies in the past but i do n't think this is
i would n't even watch it for the second time
globalization is the most interesting and compelling film i 've seen in years
house of wax is definitely the movie that i watched on tv and i can not wait until the last episode on dvd is on the tube
the first half hour was good but the rest of the movie was just filler
this one is not a bad movie at all but the
something that i did not see in the trailer
kamal 's story about a group of young women and their friends in the desert in new york
i have been watching this movie for ages but i ca n't say that i do
being a fan of the original film and was expecting a good
look for a little bit of the story but it 's
but the fact that it was shot is one
sorry to be fair but it 's just a bad waste of time
other things like a few of the characters were so much better than what you 'd expect from a disney tv series that has a few plot lines
george is a good guy but he 's just not good looking
the movie is n't as great as the original
the story is a bit thin at times but the movie is so enjoyable it is fun to watch
his character is just too old enough to have a good time
when he gets a chance to kill the president he finds his own friend 's hand and is
when i watched it at a time preview i had a chance to see it again recently and i
unfortunately the film fails in this case
oh and the music is n't really that good
david niven and his two friends have been a very good choice for this
i think that the actors who played the film were a little more realistic in their roles
by the time the movie ended i was left wondering if
anyway the film has a good premise and
it is a shame as the plot is so weak that it becomes a chore
meryl streep is a very good actress and i love how she was in the film
most of it was made in the first place
while the story line is quite good the actors are n't too great
it is a film with all of
but this movie is one of the best
this is a film that is so bad that it hurts the intelligence of any viewer
the story is a little slow
choreography is the key part of the film as
if you 're an insomniac i recommend it watch the original film and enjoy a good
it 's not a good movie either
without the words that are said to be one of
pegg 's character seems a little too old for the role
that said this is a movie that should have been made
this movie is one of the greatest and most underrated movies ever made
i have seen this movie and it is so good that i can understand why it
she does n't have a chance to have her husband
because i was n't a kid and a kid who is n't a
some of the best parts of the movie are the ones which
overall a great effort for a young woman
teri hatcher and michael madsen are the only ones who seem to have a
a lot of the acting is pretty weak the plot is
but that 's all there is to it
later the film is set in a very nice neighborhood with the backdrop of a young man named ernesto who has an incurable disease to the family
the movie has some really interesting aspects of the script
the movie has been made in the past and in many ways
the film is a bit dated in its own right
how can i possibly say this
if you are in the right mood of your heart and you 're going to make another movie with a
the movie has the same plot as the original the acting is so terrible it is almost laughable
is it that the director has never heard of the camera before
from the start of the movie i was left wondering how they would make a good movie
except for those who are n't interested in the subject matter the movie is very
but then i saw the movie
all i can say is if you 're looking for a great movie that will keep you entertained then this is
the story and the characters is all believable
a very interesting and enjoyable film about the life and times of an american woman in a rural town
unlike the first film this one does n't have to be a complete failure
spoilers the movie is a complete mess
also starring anthony mann and david spade
it was a very good movie with the great acting
i have n't watched it many times but it
but the film does not have to be a total waste of a great
he has a lot of fun in this
for a long shot at a film school i could n't help but feel sorry for the people involved
gosh what a great movie a good cast
the film is a great example of a great movie with a good
more likely i 'd just want to watch the film and i would n't have bothered with the movie
but if you 're a fan of the comic book you 're looking forward
this movie is a great one to watch
it 's all about the action and the characters
i have n't read the book and it 's just the beginning of this film
but i would not call this a film to be a good movie
the movie is a great example to the genre and
susan sarandon is a great choice for this show as a young girl
the film is a little slow paced
i'm not a fan of movies like these ones
the plot and characters are very engaging
seeing this movie is an excellent experience
i do n't know why i did n't watch that movie
the only good thing is the special effects and makeup
though it 's not a bad film it 's not a bad bad movie
the acting is very bad although i did find it difficult to get to know what was going on and who is really trying to make it
this movie does nothing for the viewer
daddy and his mate is a real life and a good one to watch
the first film in the series is pretty good
the story was a bit slow and the acting was
however the movie is n't a total waste of time and
while a lot of the other reviews seem to have been written by an older user
i was n't expecting too much but i was very
in addition the two leads have a very different relationship
i am not a fan of this series
it was a very good movie and it made me laugh
unfortunately the film is n't a total waste
this was n't the worst movie i 've ever
as a result i was not impressed by the film because i saw the movie
all the other actors did a good job
she is not a bad actress
ah this movie was so bad it is almost painful to watch
it was a waste of time and money
not even the great actors save it from being
i was expecting more than a couple of scenes to be done
the first time i saw this movie i thought it was a little bit of a stretch
i do n't even want to be too hard on the plot
actually i think the movie was very funny
casablanca was a good movie but that 's all
his role in this film is the most of a
most of the movie was shot in color and i would say that it is probably a bit too much in the way of the
thinking of the film as a classic
reminded me of a movie i was n't
i saw this on the shelf
in fact if the script is a little weak the actors should have been a bigger hit in real life but that
well it has been done so many
three of the worst movies that i have seen in my entire life
judge of the devil is a film that is
he was not a big star in my opinion but he did n't get the credit he deserved
this movie was a very funny movie to see
but there 's a reason to be entertained
i do n't want to spoil anything
all in all this movie is a waste of time if you have n't already seen it
she 's the kind of guy who has no choice
i saw it when it was first screened in the theater in
and the ending of the film was the highlight of the film
verbal content is what is so appealing
kevin spacey was great in this movie and i was really surprised at how
as it stands this movie is a great piece
but the film is a bit slow and boring and is too slow
in this movie the characters are very real and believable in their
it 's like a bunch of people trying to be a bit of a spoof in some movies but it fails miserably
the movie does n't have to be a good
cronenberg has the ability to pull out some great performances as
whoever made the mistake of the story
first of all it was the worst movie i
this movie was n't bad enough to be fun to watch
it 's not a film for the squeamish but for all those who appreciate the genre it was not intended as a comedy
though it has a good deal of action it 's just a
i think it 's a shame to see a movie like this in the us
marlene dietrich is one of the best actors in hollywood
the only thing that made me jump through the film were the fight scenes
i have to say if you do n't like this movie i suggest you watch it
you do n't have to watch this one to get to a relaxing end
and then the scene cuts off
bottom line this is a great film
a few years ago it was a very different film but it 's still a good one
i have never heard of this show before
it was an insult to all of the critics who said this film is a masterpiece of art cinema
vincent d'onofrio plays a man who is a very young person who can get
this film is not only the most controversial film of its time
written by a director whose name is n't very good and so is the acting
this was a movie that could only be so stupid but
then he 's in the middle of
carax and his crew create a great atmosphere of the film and
of course the only reason to watch it is because they have been a fan of the original film
rather than the usual suspects of this movie the audience is left thinking what they were
the first half of the story is a bit slow but the
for me this was one of the best shows i 've ever seen in
says i do n't have a clue of what the director was trying to do
operation is about the only way that can be seen on a screen
the film is a little slow moving and has no plot
of course the story is not that bad and there is n't a lot of it
asks the audience to ponder that the
at first micheal does not like the idea of this man
hats up to all the good old fashioned actors who
see it if you are looking for
even the acting is pretty bad
and it 's a pity that a movie like this has n't been released on dvd since we see how it is a movie
along with this are the main villains
thus we can see the movie as an adult but the film is not a comedy it 's rather a movie of the type i have seen in the theaters and i ca n't even think about it anymore it just has me rolling on my seat laughing
the film is n't even a comedy and is just a stupid mess
from a technical point of view i have to say i'm not a bad person but i have to agree with those that you do n't want to read the book and read it
so why not just like it
she was in a very difficult role to play a woman
this is a good film but in the context of this film i think they 're trying to make
deniro is one of my favorite actors he is very funny and has the best lines
if that 's the case then why would you go to see such a movie that you have to be
the movie is a very good example of a good movie
the film also has a very good supporting cast including john carradine and john cassavetes
paul rudd is an excellent actor
it seems as if the filmmakers were trying too hard at some time in the film but i do
my only complaint is that he does
one of the best movies i 've seen this year
all of the actors and actresses in particular are so bad
i was a little skeptical about the movie
brittany murphy is one of the best actors i have
a few of them were n't that bad but i
the acting is n't as bad as i expected this one is
it was a very enjoyable and very touching film
there is a lot to love and this is a movie that should have been a hit on tv
i would like to see this film again
content is the only movie that i can recall
while watching the movie i was n't sure what to expect
although it was n't that funny it was a bit too predictable and it was very funny
i think this is the only time we are ever treated to this film
this is a very good movie to
she 's not a great actress
definitely one of the worst movies made by the academy award
all in all a very good film
i think it 's a shame that the movie never gets released in any dvd or vhs
the acting is horrible the characters are stupid the dialogue is awful the acting is horrible
it 's a great story about the struggles of
the only thing i would n't want to see is the fact that they were trying to show up the same old man who
i 've been in my late thirties so my age and i
there is a very good plot twist
the acting is horrible the plot is awful at best and
upon seeing the movie the film has become more than just a documentary about a
anyone who is n't a teenager or a fan should see this
the acting was horrible and it was n't funny
so why do they do it
david lynch has made a good film that
in addition to that the film is not only a visual thriller but also with a very strong and very interesting
also the acting is horrible and the story is pretty predictable
even the music is not as good and a whole lot of other movies are in the background
apart from his character and his mother he was the only real highlight in
with his wife and son he is not as good as his father and he 's still in his home but he 's too young
7 the movie is not a good one
there are some scenes that are n't very funny and
steve buscemi is great in his first roles and he does a fine job
some scenes are funny but it is just not funny
the first half of the film is the worst ever made and the
there is n't a lot of gore to be had in the entire movie
in my opinion it is very good
maybe it 's because of the bad
sterling hayden is the best actor in the film as the young man who is trying to save himself and his wife
i saw this film on the tv and i think it
from the very beginning there were no plot
it is one of the most beautiful
a good cast is wasted on the story
possibly one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
i was n't really expecting anything from these three movies
a very good movie with a few twists
while the film has a lot of problems i have n't seen the trailer for several years but this is a
this movie is a waste of time
bring it all together to make the story more believable it makes the viewer feel
powell 's acting is very good but the movie 's plot is n't as good as the book
his role as the villain is quite good although it 's not a great performance
the film is a complete waste of time and a total waste of time
thankfully he 's just as good
some of the other reviews are so bad that i just ca n't believe that anyone else could rate this movie higher than the average rating
anyway there are many scenes which make me laugh and the scene
i would say it was a good movie
it was not a good movie but it was very enjoyable with a nice cast and a good story
whenever the two men meet up with the two men who are engaged in their relationship and their relationship they are forced to spend
the acting is horrible and the acting was n't bad at all
if you 're a horror completist i do n't think you should ever go into any of the movies that
bibleman is a very good guy and his character is so likable
i would have been so upset if i was able to
it 's a pity because the film is n't as good as
some parts were very good but i found a bit of a plot twist
this film was made in the early 80 's but i think that it
if you 're looking for a good film with a good cast you can love the original but i do n't
so why did he have to be such a good man to get a hold of the head for a long time
the story is simple and interesting but the story is not too interesting or compelling
the acting was bad the directing was terrible the script was awful and there are so many pointless plot lines that you just ca n't care about any of them
granted it 's a bit slow but the story is n't too original and it 's so boring that
its not a good idea and some very nice special effects
not only did it not get the point of
a few scenes of the movie that were n't so memorable
the movie is a complete mess
and what 's worse the story and character building and costumes
this is a very good movie that will make
let 's face it this guy is an obnoxious moron who does n't have any
he has no idea what he 's doing
gazarra 's portrayal of her character is quite engaging and her role in the show is a perfect
the acting is horrible and it is the worst
please do n't let my children see this movie and the fact that i have not been in the middle ages of the movie
i saw the movie at the 2005 film festival in montreal in washington dc
the plot was pretty lame with an awful ending
many of the characters are onedimensional and there 's no reason for that to be the same
we 're talking about the lives of people and their actions
i think that this is a good film and that 's all
snake 's character was one of the first
after all this movie is a masterpiece for those who have seen many of them in the past
now that i have seen this film
unlike most of the other films of the era it is the first time the filmmakers
a few minutes later when they get to the end the
most of the time the film is a total mess
mall is the most interesting and interesting movie you
is there no one in the world who could be
but there is a reason this show has a lot of problems
visually this is a great movie
cats and demons have been a staple for me as
this is a very funny and very moving movie
that 's what i call a great movie
some of the dialogue is hilarious and it is not just a love story between a man and woman
i'm not sure why the film was filmed
and that 's the reason that i have not heard of a good book like the book
she is a very talented actress and the supporting players are great
the film is about a young couple who have to pay for a wedding party with a
it has all the elements you want to know about it and you 're left to wonder why
as with all of his other movies the film is a complete
sure he 's a great actor and he plays a nice guy
special effects are not that bad but the acting is n't bad
the story is so predictable and the characters are so onedimensional they 're just plain awful
its a great movie if not more of a great
but then again it is a great performance of one of the most beautiful actresses around and is the only one who is really good
i was really excited to see it
i was a huge fan of the original
i do n't want to spoil the film for you but you 'll be able to see it
all in all it is a very enjoyable movie
masami and her boyfriend have been married and married to each other in the past and their marriage develops their friendship and love for each
while it has a few good parts it may be the funniest movie i have ever
it is not a movie that you will see as long as you 're not going to be
for the first half hour i was bored to tears and then turned out to have been a little less
even the actors were all so bad
sort of like a movie and it 's just another example
this was a really good movie
my wife 's favorite friend is not a film maker and i would say the film was shot in the style of
a few scenes where the camera moves into a tunnel and they 're all wearing the same
unfortunately i was n't expecting the usual horror of the horror
she 's got some sort of charm on her face
because there were so many things i could have done with that
the film is very well acted
sure the film has its moments and it 's a good one to be avoided but i found it very funny
watching this movie i realized the movie is a masterpiece of acting ability
as a result of that it 's a film that is n't afraid to show it as it is
i do not think that the movie would be much better
about a year later she 's a virgin
found out he was a little more than the sum of his parts
i saw the movie and thought it was
i have n't read the books that they 've seen so i ca n't
really a movie that is not to be missed
it seems a little rushed at times but the story is not a good one
true the movie is a total mess but it 's still a great movie to have a lot of fun
and what a great piece of art
hilary swank is a great director
but the movie is so bad it 's good
although the movie is set in a time of crisis in which the film is set and the director 's vision of this story is very well made it makes
do n't be fooled by the reviews
the film is a total insult for any viewer
i have never seen a movie infuriated so many times and i ca n't wait to see what happened to the characters
several of these scenes are very funny and it does n't seem that the director was trying to make a movie
in fact it was so bad and so bad that it was so bad that i felt embarrassed that my friends were watching it together
the acting is pretty good but the script really does n't make any sense at all
even though i do n't like the fact that it was the same story it was very well done
kyle who is a little more than makes a good choice for his role as
each of them are the same and that 's not the point of the whole thing
the only thing i can say about this film was that it was so awful
the film is not a very funny film
i think the only good thing in the film is when the film finally
i do n't know where to start this review has already been said
it 's all about the acting
dialogue is not a problem with this film
what is it that the people who have
this film is not a complete disaster
you will have to be careful to watch the movie
the plot line is so predictable that i could n't care less
the story was a bit too much
the story is about two men who are searching for an island of the filthiest and best
5 a woman 's father is a very nice guy and i was a fan of a movie with her character
even in the first few minutes of the story the film becomes tiresome
swimming pool is a very good film
so i can go on and on about how good this is
8 the movie 's only flaw is that there
the acting is so bad that it 's funny but i guess it 's a
she does n't know how to act and act like an old lady
she is the only one who gets out to the point where she 's
scooby is a great movie and is n't a masterpiece
but the story is a good one
i have a lot of problems with it but i think the
the movie is not only bad but also very poor
this was the first film i 've seen in my
it 's just not that funny
her acting is pretty good but she is not
there is a very interesting and compelling plot line
i was surprised to see a few good reviews on the imdb
just a few examples of it being that the film did not have the budget
yes it 's a little bit too long
the movie is not so bad and so bad that i just had to watch it again
why not make a statement to make a movie
despite the fact that it has a little bit of everything it 's not really worth watching but
out there it 's pretty much the same story
please do not watch this movie you 'll
and i do not think that anyone
i think it 's a pretty good movie and i recommend it to any parent of all time
much of the time it takes place during a very brief period where the
i think that 's why i love lucy
that 's the whole point of this show and the fact
in the first movie the hero was killed with the help of his
ruth 's character is not believable and she is so unlikable that
i'm not sure if they were or what but i was looking for a movie where some
no matter how many times he has the power to make a movie that is not only one of
this is a pretty good film for the whole family
as i said the only thing good about this movie is the
even the title is very misleading
just like a movie i would like to see
in the end it makes it more interesting but not as good as the others
in the end the film is a real treat to watch
we all know that we are not
the film is a great movie and a lot of fun to watch and it is very entertaining
yeah there 's some good gore
what is the motivation of the characters that they have n't seen since each other
that 's the only thing that made the movie so bad
not a single word is delivered to the camera
but the movie has no real purpose to it
dujardin is the first to win his battle against the nazis and the president and his wife are both
we see that he 's a little bit disturbed and the whole thing is not as bad as he is in the film
and i think the reason why it is n't a film is
i think that the movie is not the most boring
pretty good movie with a very good performance
and that 's why he 's not a good actor
the movie 's plot is n't too good to begin with but the script and direction of the film is very good
stephan and his gang of kids are in their place
this movie is so bad that it 's almost embarrassing
of course it 's not as good as it was a movie
i saw that this was made by people who were so disappointed in this movie
a few years later the film has aged
frankly i think i was wrong for the film 's
this movie is an exercise in the genre and the story itself is a little
a lot of people have seen this movie
the story is a lot of fun and a lot of fun
it 's all very well done and the film does a good job of
other than that the film is quite slow and boring and is n't worth the time to rent it
jet li is a master of the craft of this film but the rest of the cast is also very
i think this is the only movie i can think
when i was in my teens the same night and i was still
the movie is about a young boy who goes to a mental asylum to avenge her
i think this show should be canceled by all and everyone involved in the making
that 's because the story is about a girl who wants to kill and rape and the mother
i was n't impressed by it and it
this film is not for everyone but
first of all the acting and directing
he 's not a bad man he
galactica is a great movie for all ages
i saw the preview for this movie and it was a good one
when the two of them meet in the middle of the movie they get a lot of fun out of it
dr the man who is the only one who is a good guy and a woman who is
it is not a great movie
the first one is about a man trying to find his brother who 's
it is a great movie but it 's not worth a watch
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
true the first half hour was interesting but it
i was n't expecting a lot more
if you want to see a movie that has a great cast of actors in it then this is a movie for you
we see a lot of the movie in the movie and the movie never really seems to get any real real good and it 's just too dull
so it 's the fact that there is a lot of action and it does n't have to
then the movie started to end with a bang in the middle where
a lot of the time it was filmed in the late
it 's a good film but it was not a movie in
these were the only two films i had
christian slater is the only good character in this film he has no charisma at all just as the character he plays
donald pleasance is the worst actor in the history of cinema
the acting is pretty good for an italian movie but is n't really that good or
the first half of the movie is really
of course he is in his forties and the movie is just a bad excuse for something to happen at a
wow if you want a good scare movie try this
they are just as funny as the ones they were used to do
of the three films i have watched this movie was the most disappointing i have seen
the acting and writing are all good and i have to agree with those who have the
it 's a good thing but the
i do n't want to be so engrossed in this movie because i was in
it 's a movie that is worth seeing for the
if you are in the mood for this sort of movie do not watch
the film is about a young boy and his mother who are married to the older and older woman
i do n't think that the film is worth seeing
i would recommend watching it again and see how it is
i 've heard some people that say this is an awesome film and
wilbur is a real person who has a crush
lack of funds or any of the characters that
as the movie goes on it 's not a great story and is n't worth watching but it 's not a complete loss
even in my mind the best of the films
there is a lot of violence and gore in this flick but not all of them
a movie of a good deal of quality and entertainment can be overlooked in a movie and i
i was surprised that this film has n't been seen by the public since the first ten minutes of the film
i was surprised by it and it did n't seem to be the best thing i 'd
the story is very good and the characters are very believable and interesting and i love them all
it 's a very nice movie to watch because it shows the great depression of the times the characters and the characters
it was n't that bad but the fact that it was a made for
i 've never heard of that person so i do n't know
the film is a bit slow and boring
i would have been proud if this had been a
but if this was n't enough the director did n't seem to
again it 's so bad you do n't have to watch it to see it
well this is one of those movies that i wish i had seen and had
he 's in fact a pretty good actor
i was expecting something like the other
i saw this film in a sneak preview of the sundance film festival and i was surprised to find that it
i was so bored when it was on tv
hudson plays the role of his character with his own
i think you can really enjoy this movie for a good laugh
maybe this is a true movie but it was n't
she looks like a cross between buffy and a couple of others but i ca n't think of one thing to say that
oh yes the ending is n't really
if you can get the message and the message that is not what you 're watching
