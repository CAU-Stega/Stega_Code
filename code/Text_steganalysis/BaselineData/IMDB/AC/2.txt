the film is about a young girl named seita who is sent to
on the other hand i would have liked to see the movie in the theater
as for the rest of the movie it 's not that bad
the movie is a complete mess
he is not the only one who has to deal with
troy is not a good guy
there 's a lot of nudity in the film and it 's a bit
it is not the worst movie i have
you have to see it if you are a fan of
all in all a good film to
if you have a chance to watch a film about the evils of war this film is for you
i think that this film should be viewed by everyone in their prime
outstanding performances of all of the cast and crew
highly recommended for fans of the original
such a shame that the filmmakers did n't have the money to do
they were all so stupid and i was embarrassed that i had spent money on this movie
i do not recommend this film for anyone who is not a fan of musicals
off the wall of the earth it is the fact that the entire movie is a little too
but the movie does n't have the budget of a b grade b movie
these are not the ones we 're looking for but
and the movie is a bit too long
there was n't a moment in the movie that i could n't stand
the movie was made in the 80 's
lauren bacall is a great actress and she is great
since the film is a little slow paced and very slow it 's a very
sorry to say that i was n't impressed but i was n't expecting a movie of the sort
actually i think the movie is very
the acting is very poor and the story is very predictable
robin williams was excellent as always
end of spoiler i do n't think it would have been so much more
in this movie he 's a man who is trying to make a good movie
they 're not the least bit believable
but it is a good movie
it has been the same year that the same thing is the same way again
a few of the actors were pretty good and the story line was pretty decent
if the movie was made for a good director and it would n't have been the first movie i 'd like to say the least it
yeah it is a good movie but the acting was terrible and the writing was poor
the film is very slow moving and
it 's a very bad film
i was n't impressed with this movie but i do n't know why the heck was the first movie
at the beginning the film is set up in the middle of a conversation and the scene
i do n't think that the movie is a good example of what a film can do with a film
pia 's acting was a bit overdone but the story line was pretty good and the ending was a great surprise
the film is a very good film
its a great movie to watch
also the film is a little too long
not to mention that the film is not very well made and has no plot
but it 's just a little bit of a mess
they are all so bad that i ca n't even begin to describe how bad it is
it 's not a bad film it is not a bad movie but it does have
move to a small town and a bunch of people who
when i was a kid i was so bored that i had
one of the worst films i have ever seen
bob hoskins 's performance is a joy to behold
because the movie was so good it 's
although the movie is a little bit of a mess it 's not the least bit
let me tell you that this film has no redeeming qualities
the film is a bit slow but it is n't too bad
when i first watched this movie i was n't expecting it to end
man i was so disappointed that i was
a few years later he has been in a mental asylum and has been a successful pianist for the past few
i have to wonder how many times you have a movie like these two movies
maybe the film was shot in the same year and it 's the same old time that we
it 's a very funny movie with
normally i think that this is a very funny film and i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good movie
i have n't seen the movie yet but i do n't know why i have to watch it again
my only complaint is that this is not a movie
a few years later i have a fondness for this movie
too often i do not think that this is an interesting idea and it 's a shame that the director did
the acting is good with some of the best actors in the business
i was surprised to see this movie on a
but the film does not have a lot
it is a shame that it is not available on dvd or vhs release
in the end it 's just a bad movie
i have n't seen it since it was made and
so i was n't expecting much from it but i did not have
faced with the fact that he is the one who is the only person who knows what he is doing and he
this film was so bad it was laughable
i have never seen the movie but i do not think that this is one of the
anyone who has seen the film knows that it has a great story and great characters
the story is about the adventures of
however the movie is n't a bad one
here is where the film is concerned
and the film has a lot of action
no it 's not for everybody
despite the fact that it has a very good story the acting is very good
sorry i did n't like it
i have never seen such an amazing film in the past
well this is the first of the three films i 've seen and i was surprised that
i do n't think this is why the film is so bad
this is a movie about two people
when you 're in a movie you 're not really going to get the point of view
this movie is a must see
and i have to say that the acting is very
in fact it was a very enjoyable film and it
in the first movie the story is very good and there 's a very good
some people say this film is a masterpiece
the film is a little slow but the acting is excellent
james caan is the best thing about this movie
i do n't want to spoil it for you but if you 're a fan of the book and do n't have any expectations you 'll
or maybe it 's the fact that the film has been a long time
this is a very funny film
edison and his friends have the same problem and they do
but the movie has no substance whatsoever
here we have a film that will
what 's the point of this movie
the movie was a waste of time and money
one of the best films i have ever seen and
why did i watch this movie
this movie is so awful it 's funny
this is a movie that i would
michael dudikoff was a bit of an
during the course of the movie the viewer is given the feeling that they are not going to be in the movie
most of the time the film is a bit slow but the
the film is not a comedy or a drama or a drama
it 's a shame because i have n't seen the movie
and the ending is a bit abrupt but
in this film he 's a good guy but he is not the only character who can
it 's a very funny movie and
there is a lot of good things going on here but it 's not enough
a very enjoyable film that should be
look for the scene where he tells the police that the murderer is the killer in
there 's no reason why the director would be so much of a fan of this film and it 's not the best of the bunch
instead we get to see a young man dressed as a model of his own
there was a lot of action
heck it was a good film
these guys are the only ones who have ever been in a
another problem with the film is the fact that it was made in the early 90
his character is so annoying that he does n't seem to care for himself
crawford is a very strong woman who 's a bit of a jerk
stand out from the other movies
the acting is pretty good but the story is so
and it was n't that bad
i have to agree with the comments on how this movie has a lot of problems
if you have not seen this film do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time
particularly the scene in which the two boys are on the phone and the girls get shot up and the girls are chased by the same guy
speaking of which is the most important aspect of this movie
now i know it 's the only
people are talking about this movie
i have seen this movie and i can honestly say it 's the best of the
how did they make a film like this
neither the movie nor the acting
at first glance the movie is n't even bad
the film is very well acted and the acting is excellent
character development is the main reason why the movie is so good
in the end it 's not a great movie
dora has a good job with the woman he loves
it is n't even worth mentioning that it
i have seen the first three seasons of season 1 and
he is a man who is n't afraid to take a trip to a
i think that the director should have made the movie a lot more interesting
ben affleck is the only one who manages to make this movie watchable
in fact i would like to see this movie again
despite the fact that the film is a little bit slow it is still a very good movie and it is a very good one
squabbles and love story is a film about a young man who is a
the movie is very well acted and is a great movie
the film is a bit slow but it does not make any sense
here he is the only one who seems to be a bit
joe is the one who 's got the hots for the
which is why this movie was so good
in a way i do not want to spoil the film for you
it is n't a good movie to be taken seriously as it is not
still i do n't think that this
roddenberry 's direction is very good and the
still it 's a great movie to watch
she is a great actress but she 's not a bad actress
daughter and daughter are the best thing in this movie and they 're both great
rescue the president and then the hero and his son
the film 's main flaw is to have a lot of money and time wasted in the film
have you ever heard of the film
as for the story it 's just too much to be considered
this was the first film i 've watched with the same character and it was so bad
i have seen the movie and it is very good
unfortunately the story line is n't really that good as it is a little bit of a stretch
movies like this should not be made
but the movie is a little slow
for me it 's just a movie
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
otherwise this film is a total bore
i have to say the acting was good the directing and directing was excellent and the writing was great
unfortunately it does n't work for me as
a few minutes later i was a bit skeptical about it but i did not like this movie
although the film has a very strong story the story is pretty weak the acting is terrible
from the opening sequence of events and the first one 's the story is very simple and it is a good
hollywood has made a film that has a lot to say
it 's not the most profound of
yvonne de havilland is the only one who can act and he 's just a good actress but she 's not convincing
it 's a shame the rest of the cast did n't have the same skills as the one in the
i do n't know what to say
roles of the characters are very good and the film is very good
the movie is a little slow paced but it 's a good movie
i do n't think that the film would have had a good plot
it 's a very bad movie and i think it is a very low budget movie
the acting is good and the story line is very
of course he is n't afraid to go to the police
saffron massey is a very talented actor and he plays the role
i'm not saying that the acting was horrible
the film is a very funny and very funny film
marines and the marines are the ones who are the only people who can be
it was a good idea to get a few laughs
brown was the only actor who had any talent and he was very convincing in this movie
he 's a great actor and a good actor
in this film he 's not a bad guy
in fact i think the director was trying to get the audience to believe
horrid acting bad acting and even worse acting
most of it 's characters are so boring that you can only imagine that the
as the film goes on the movie becomes very predictable
he was the only actor who could have been more effective
wow this movie is n't bad
this is not the case with the movie but because of the way it
fiance and son are the only two reasons why this is not a very good movie
i was n't impressed with this one at all but it
in a nutshell the film 's title refers to a number of other movies
hence the movie is a little slow
the acting is very good and the story is pretty good
for the record it is a very good film with a
the film is a very good movie that is not just about the subject of the events of the world and the
the acting is pretty bad but the story is n't bad
i do n't think this movie is a masterpiece of art or entertainment
so i have seen a lot of bad
this is one of the most beautiful movies i 've ever seen
this is a film that i would watch for the little girl in
this is the best of them all
however the story is very simple and the characters are so well developed
he was the only one who could n't possibly be the killer
vulnerable and funny and the movie is a perfect example of
save yourself a few bucks and see this
director michael winner has a good idea to show the real world of the characters and the characters
it is the story of a young woman who is
it 's not even worth mentioning that the
if you are a diehard fan of horror films this movie is a must see for
the movie is a complete mess and it is n't even a
it is a very good film and i would recommend it to anyone who loves the
actually i have n't seen the movie yet
sorry to say i was disappointed but i was surprised by the fact that the film is a little too short
two years earlier he 's in his late 20s and early 20s and
mccallum 's character is a bit too much for the character and the
while the movie was n't the most realistic movie i have seen in the last decade it was a complete disappointment
eye candy is a very funny movie
not that it 's not that bad but i have to
all in all a very enjoyable film
what 's the point of this movie
talk about a man who 's a man and an expert
but the real reason why the film was made is a mystery
thanks to a cast of talented actors who play the
a lot of the film was made for the sake of the film
i think the film 's best asset is the presence of a young man who is
joe don baker was the best in his career as a man who was able to commit a crime
those who do n't like this film should be ashamed of themselves for their actions
now i have n't been in a state of shock
a lot of people are killed and there is a lot of people
this is a great movie to see and i recommend it to everyone
and i do n't think it would have been so bad
a very good film with a very good cast
guarding the film 's premise of this film
personally i think the film was shot on location in the early 1800 's and early 90 's
the movie is a complete mess and the only thing
it 's a very good movie and it 's not the best
a very good film with some very good actors
i was n't impressed when i saw the film and was
being a big fan of the original i found it difficult to believe the movie was
the movie is a bit slow and boring but the
eytan stewart was a good guy but he was a bit too old for this role
the film was shot in black and white and was shot in a very
banderas is the most talented character in this film and he 's a fine
meanwhile the movie is set in the present day and it does have a very very
being a big fan of the original series i was expecting to see more of the
the film is a bit too long and the characters are too shallow to be interesting
for a film about a man who was murdered by the man he met and loved his son
but i have seen this film and i
it is the story of a young boy named seita
lets face it the acting is terrible
i think it 's one of the best movies i have ever seen
first of all i have n't seen the original
she is a great actor but she is so annoying that she is just so bad that it 's hard to
the acting is pretty good and the plot
rory 's character was not believable but
there 's nothing wrong with that and it 's not even worth the
prisoner of thieves is a movie about a young girl who is attracted
partly the movie is a complete waste of time
while the story line is not a little farfetched there 's also a good deal of suspense and
that 's the best part of this movie
compared to other movies i have seen this one is the most boring
there is no real story to this movie
but i do n't think that the film is a total waste
also the movie was very funny and i think the director should be applauded for
the acting is horrible the story is awful
basically this is a film that is n't even
this movie is a must see for anyone looking for a good movie
beyond the script the acting is pretty good
watching this movie is a real treat to watch
really it 's not a bad film
it 's just a bad movie and i do n't even think that the actors were trying to make a good movie and the acting was terrible
you have to be a big fan of the genre
this is a great movie and i think it was a great movie
some of the scenes are very good
for the first hour i was really impressed
now that i have read the book i am a fan of the original
but it is a good movie
it is a very good movie
death bed is one of the worst movies i have seen
from the very start of the movie the movie was a little too long
this is one of the worst movies ever
if you are looking for an intelligent film with the usual clichs and a good plot you 'll be
all the actors are excellent and the movie is a perfect example of how a movie should
what i did like was the acting of the two main characters and
the movie was shot in black and white and the actors were n't very convincing
interesting to see a young girl who has a crush on her own and is a very human character
be prepared to be disappointed by the film 's message
in fact the only good part is the scene with
kinda a good film and a good movie
for me the film is a very enjoyable experience
then i saw a few episodes of this movie that i thought were the worst
if you 're looking for an action film that is a bit over the top then you 'll love this
the film is about a group of young adults who go to the woods to find a job in a
however it is not a movie
if it 's not so much a little bit of a mystery i think that 's the point
we are left with an interesting story of the hardships of
the movie was n't so bad it
the film is a complete mess of the original and it 's not even the good
raveena is a good actor and i think that his acting in this film is very good
the movie is a little slow but the plot is so simple
how can you not be so stupid
and i do n't want to spoil anything
also the film is not about a man who
there are some funny scenes in the film
considering that the film is a bit slow it is a very entertaining film
unfortunately the story line is n't that great
that 's the best part of this movie
so the movie has a very interesting plot and
an excellent film that i enjoyed watching and a lot of the time
ace ventura is a great actor and he is perfect as the villain
most of the time the film is set in the present day and it 's not the type of movie
sigh i have to say that the acting is pretty good and
present the film 's story is a simple one
of course he is the one who has to be a little more
in this movie the characters are not very likable
i have seen a lot of movies and have been a
picture was a good movie but it was n't
as the story continues to unravel the story begins to unravel
i have to admit i did n't like it
rory is the only person who can get a job in the first place
in the end it is a movie that you should not watch
through the film the viewer is left feeling cheated by the film and the characters
so i have to admit that i was n't disappointed by this film
however the film is a complete failure
rated r for violence and sexual situations and a
the film is a very good film
the story is about a bunch of people who have a relationship and are not a married couple
technically it is a good film and a very
dick tracy is a good actor but he 's a bit of a
the film is a bit of a mess but the story is so interesting
well i guess it 's a movie that i can watch over and over again
the film has a very good plot and the characters are likable
all in all it is a very funny and enjoyable film
this is a movie that is not only a very bad
i think this movie was a huge mistake
there are many scenes where you can see the actors playing the characters in the movie
books are always a pleasure to watch and the story
almost every scene is a dream
perhaps the most important thing in this film is how much it does n't have the same impact
i do not think that this film is the best of the bunch and it 's a
however the movie is a little slow and
lancaster is the best actor of the film and the film is not very well written
the acting is horrible the plot is bad
it 's just a shame that this movie has n't been released theatrically in theaters but i do n't
i was n't really sure whether it was the director or the director 's intention but it was n't that good
those who are not familiar in the history of the war and
i was expecting a lot from this movie but i was n't disappointed
stan and ollie are the best characters in this movie
you 'll be surprised at the end
in the meantime the movie is set in a very small town
like a lot of the movies i have seen this one is a bit of a letdown
the film is not about as bad as the first one but the rest is just a mess
the film 's plot revolves around the adventures of the two sisters and
the acting is horrible and the plot
he is a very good actor
every character in the movie was a stereotype
he is the best of all the characters in the movie
not only is it so bad it 's good
otherwise i 'd recommend this film to all fans of horror and fans
tyrone russell is great as the lead
the story is a little weak
the movie is a bit slow but it is a bit slow
i have seen this film several times
so the movie has a good deal of humor but the movie is n't funny
maybe the movie is just a bunch of kids
it 's not even a good movie
i do n't know if it 's
several of the scenes are so stupid that it 's hard to see why the film would n't have
the film is a very good film that is n't afraid to be a good
if i was n't that i 'd probably have to say i 'd rather watch this movie again
do yourself a favor and rent the original
here 's the breakdown the movie was made in the us and was
therefore the film is a bit too long for the first
but i have to admit that i was very impressed by the fact that it was a complete
i have n't read any of the other reviews here
the film is about a group of young people living in a small apartment in new york
that was n't the case in the movie but
this is one of the most underrated movies ever made
admittedly the film is a little too long for its own good
every time she is on screen she does not even get a clue about the story
but i do n't have a problem with the story
then again what does this have to do with the rest of the movie
i have seen this movie several times in the past 25 years
no wonder that this movie is n't
ana is a very good actress
although i do n't know how to make it a bad movie it 's a waste of my time
i have never seen a movie that is so bad that it 's funny
ca n't be more wrong than this
in fact it 's not a good movie and it does have a good deal of suspense
then the movie switches into a story and it is a bit of a stretch for a movie
do n't worry to the contrary that you 'll have a hard time finding it
not only did he not get his hands on the set but the story was pretty good
the movie is a very good film that is n't just about
the movie is a complete mess of the first film
it 's a pity that this film did n't have the same
want to be the first to see
410 the movie was n't a bad movie but
i do not think the film is a masterpiece of
i do n't want to spoil anything about this movie
i have to say that this was one of the most underrated movies of all
it is n't even a good movie but it 's not as bad as some
though this is a great movie it is a great film
he 's the only actor who can save this movie from being
even the acting is terrible the directing awful and the plot is so lame
it 's not a bad film
a few minutes later the film takes place at the end
some of the actors are n't good and the movie is just too bad
and that is what i thought was the best of the two films
it was a great movie to see
hoffman 's acting is so bad that it is almost comical to watch
i was n't expecting anything from this film
to be fair i did n't know what to expect but i was surprised by the film 's end
i do n't want to give away the ending
why did n't they just kill the president
if you are looking for a movie that is a little bit of
the movie is about the power of war and it 's a lot of
and the film is a little too long
gus 's evaluation is a very good movie
i do n't know if i can get it out of the way
but i do n't think it 's that much more than that it 's not
there are many other examples that i have seen in
whilst the story is not the best of the two films the acting is superb
but i do n't know what the
most of the actors in this film were very bad
i do n't think that a movie
wtf is the story of a young woman named angela who is a little girl and she is the
however this was a great story and i think it would have been better if they were n't
i was expecting the worst movie i
she is a very attractive woman and a
but i do n't think that it 's a real movie
much of the movie takes place in a small town
the film is very well acted and directed and it has a lot of great moments
actually i think it was a great movie
if you want to make a good movie out of it it 's not
the film is about the power of the characters the characters the relationships and the way they are
instead of a movie that is a complete waste of time and money
i was expecting this movie to be a great movie to watch
feroz khan is the best actor ever to grace

i'm glad i saw it in the theatre
just as you would expect it to
arn is a very good movie
instead of the usual hollywood fare it 's just a cheap mess that is n't funny
if you want a good laugh and laugh out loud funny this
i do n't know what the appeal of it was
having said that this movie is a complete bore
this is a very good film and it 's a shame that the film is still unavailable on
the film is not about the evils of a good or bad guy or
there are some good performances and the movie is a little
in the end it 's a good idea
directed by a great director and a cast that includes the likes of david cronenberg and john cassavetes
the film is very well done
even though it was a little bit of a parody it was a little slow and it was
a lot of people are raving about this film
he 's a great actor and a good actor
i do n't know how it got to the end but
sort of like the first film
as the film goes on it is all about the family 's
thank god that i have never seen the original
that 's why i gave it a 2 out of 10
an excellent cast and a great story about a man 's life that
jess franco 's score is the perfect complement for the movie
radio has been done by a number
however the movie is very entertaining and
there 's a lot of action and the usual action scenes are n't really a lot
he 's a very good actor
but the film is a little slow at times
originally i was n't expecting a lot more of it
and the acting is pretty good for a movie like this that i 've always liked
there are a few good points to this flick
orlando garofalo is a good actress
from the opening scene where the hero 's character is revealed to be a woman and a woman who is a little more than a little more interesting
bad acting bad plot bad acting bad script
while the story was interesting the story was pretty weak
there are a number of scenes which are so bad they could n't have saved this movie
their lives are not as good or as
the film is a little too slow and
the film is a complete bore and the acting is terrible
the movie is about a man who is a
i was surprised to find that this movie is n't even a comedy
everything is so predictable that you wonder why they

there are a few good moments in the movie but
it 's the only movie that i
some of the scenes are pretty funny and the story is a bit slow but the
meanwhile a woman who is in a wheelchair has to

i do n't know why i did n't
interestingly it is a movie that is not only for the
in fact the whole movie is a complete mess
however i have to agree with the reviewer
it is a very good movie and it 's not the only one that has been made
the film is a little too long
there is a lot of good stuff here
she is a very good actress and she 's not only good
i have never seen the first two
the movie is a complete mess
none of the characters are likable enough
deborah kerr was a great actress
overall i think it 's a shame that the movie is
the movie was shot in a very grainy and edited way that
i think the movie was a bit slow at first but it 's not a movie
how can a film with such a good cast
this movie is a waste of time
look at this as a warning to all the people who have seen the movie and i have seen it
in a sense that the movie has a very
this movie has a lot of potential but it is a great
since the film is a little over the top in its approach i would have given this film a zero out of ten but the acting and direction were so
what 's with the way the story unfolds
a lot of the film was shot in a studio studio studio
so if you 're a fan of the original you should see it
a good movie that will make you laugh
even the acting was terrible and the plot was just plain stupid
as the film goes on the film becomes a bit tedious and drags along with a few
this is not a bad film
rather the story of the film is a little bit of an insult to the book
i was n't impressed with this movie
not a good movie but a good film
the film is not about the battle against the nazis
the movie is very well done
they are not funny at all but it 's a shame they did not
no one has ever seen a good actor in the movie
but the real problem with this film is that it is n't
they are not even the ones that are n't so good
he was a great actor and was a good actor and he
the movie is a bit too long
most of the movie is about the people who live in new york
based on the novel by john heard a famous author of a novel by the name of the famous nobel prizewinning author david cronenberg is the story of a young

parallel of the film 's title the film is a very different approach and a very good
this is the first time i have seen this movie
he 's a little too old for the part but he 's not too
now i know what i am talking about but i think it 's a great movie
mike myers is a very talented actor
crumb 's character is the same
now i know that it is the worst movie i have ever seen
violence is a bit more interesting than most of the films that have
it is a very good film
when you watch the movie it is a very funny movie with a good story line and great characters
so i do commend you to avoid this one
rarely has i been so impressed by a movie that was a little too much to bear
not only was this movie a total mess but it 's not bad
the film has a lot of action and the acting is pretty good
it 's a very funny film
another thing i liked about this movie was that it had a good cast that i liked the first half
the film is a little too much of a downer
while this is n't exactly the worst movie i have seen it has to do with the
if it 's on a dvd release you 'll probably have to see the film to get it right
hilary swank was a good actress and the acting is good
the movie is a little slow but it 's not that good
being a fan of the first two films i was expecting to see a good movie but i did n't have to watch
here 's where the film starts dragging off and the film is set in a very dark atmosphere
the movie is a complete mess
given the choice of the actors and the actors involved in this production it 's hard to imagine why the director
i was so excited that i was so bored
minnelli 's film is an excellent film
kazan is a great director and this is a very good film
i have never seen such an awful movie and i ca
diana rigg is perfect as a woman who has to be a little too young to get married and is in love
the film 's main weakness is to have a lot of money spent watching this
buuel was a great actor and i hope that he can get his hands on the right side of the
a few years later i was able to see this film
oh my god it is a good film
okay so i do n't think i 've seen a movie like this before
they were so stupid that it made the film unwatchable
i'm a fan of the genre and this film is a must see
there is a scene with the young man who is a bit of a loser in his face
in fact the only thing that is good is the music
the film is a bit too long
now this is one of the most
i do n't know how it 's going to get better but it does n't
the film 's plot is about a
the film is very well done
this film is a very bad movie
this is a movie that is so good that you
the acting is horrible but the story is so bad that it 's hard to believe
this is the worst film i have ever seen
i have to admit that i am a fan of
half the movie was shot in the same place that was in the first film
what 's the deal with the rest of us
it 's just a bunch of random characters that are supposed to be funny and have a very bad ending
approach to the film is the fact that it 's a very bad film
the movie has a few funny lines but the movie is just
but it 's not a bad movie
my friend and i rented it because of the title and it sounded so bad
that 's the only reason to see it
okay so it 's a good movie but i think the movie is a total waste of time and money
the acting is good the story is
that is why the movie has been made
when i first saw it in new york i was shocked to learn that it was a very
helicopters are the same as the first movie and the second
otherwise it 's a good film to watch with your buddies
sidney poitier is a great actor and he 's not only a great actor

the movie has a very nice soundtrack but the movie is just plain bad
the film is about a man named benjamin who is
the movie has a very good plot and
sure the movie was a little too slow but i was n't expecting much of it
the film has an interesting premise but the execution is very weak
they are all so bad that you ca n't even laugh
to say it 's not funny is a bad thing because
watch it with a bunch of kids
diverting by the director 's name
the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous the acting is horrible and the writing
i was surprised by the fact that
this is a great movie to watch
410 for the first half hour
this movie has been made to be a movie about two young people who live in
such an awful movie that i have to admit to myself that
in the end i was n't sure how the film could have been so much better but it is n't
if you are a fan of the original you 'll like this
anne heche was excellent as the mother
i was surprised to find that the movie had no redeeming
near this point the film is about the same thing as the original
a lot of the film is shot in the dark and the story centers around the characters
in the end the movie is not as good as
i was n't impressed at all
3rd the plot was a little confusing and i could n't believe it
griffin dunne is a fine actor but his role is not convincing
the film is a complete waste of time
the film is a bit slow but i found it quite entertaining to watch
the movie is a complete waste of time
it is the story of two young lovers who live in the
the film is very well acted and the acting is
lori and ashley 's love for each other is also very good
most of the time the characters were not developed
succumbed to the movie 's title it was a little too hard to follow
norm 's performance was a bit stiff but the film itself was pretty good and i
despite the fact that the movie is based on a true story i do n't think it was a great movie
it is a very good film and the acting is superb
okay i know it 's a good movie
the movie is a little slow and boring but it 's not a
maybe he is n't the only character who has a personality that is not only the best actor in the movie
yet the movie is a bit of a mess
and that was the only reason why i was impressed by
the movie is a complete waste of time
she was a very nice guy and a good actor but her character was so annoying that i did n't care for her character because
i was n't really sure what to expect from this film
more like a bad dream film
if you want a good film about a man who is not a bad guy then
finally there is a lot of good stuff
but this film is a complete waste of time
some of the scenes are pretty good and some of the scenes with the
the movie has a few funny parts but
an example of how to be a good idea
your typical viewer should see a lot of movies that have n't been made
i do n't know how to make a movie that has
you have to wonder if they were trying to make something out of the ordinary
in the end it is a very good movie with a very interesting message about life in a way that is not a very interesting
my favorite character was the one with the girl who was supposed to be gay and the other girls in
meanwhile a group of young men have been kidnapped by an old man
or is it a bad film
throw in a few good actors in this one but you ca n't
several of them are very funny and the movie is a joy to watch
the film is a bit too long for me
this movie was a total disappointment
oh and i was n't expecting much
there are so many good things to say
now i do n't know how it 's going to be funny
by now we have a bunch of people who are in the same apartment as their lives in the same way
the movie is a bit slow and boring
i have seen this movie twice now and it 's still pretty good
one of my favourite parts is the scene where the girl is trying to get her son to sleep with a girl and then
will smith is the only one who is the one who is
tomorrow the movie is about a group that
then again it 's not a bad movie but i guess it 's just not that bad
this film is a must see
a few years ago i saw the trailer on the
of course the only thing that makes it worth is the fact that the movie is
you 'll see that it 's a movie
the film was a bit of a mess and i would n't have
gina 's father is a very good one and a good one
lin 's performance as an actor is a bit of a stretch
a lot of people have commented on this movie but the film has a
but it is n't the same movie
this was a very funny movie
normally i have n't seen the original but this is a very good one
nonetheless it is a great show and i hope they do it again
this movie is so bad it 's almost funny
reavis 's character is the best thing about this film and it 's not a great performance by
having a great deal of fun and a good time in my life i was n't disappointed
i was n't expecting a great movie
i do n't want to spoil it for you to see it
sure there 's a lot of action
lorna is a great actress and she does n't
i do n't think this movie was made for the sake of it
actually the movie is a complete mess
from the opening shot of the film the movie wraps up the pace of the
this is a film that should be avoided by everyone
in a way it 's a great movie
by far the worst movie i 've ever seen
one of the best films of the year and i would recommend this to everyone
it 's a great film and a great example of what is wrong with a movie
it is a great film for a rainy day
it 's a pity that this film was not available on dvd
the movie is a complete mess of a movie
i do n't want to spoil the plot
when the film 's first two minutes of the film are
it 's not even the best film of the year
none of the characters seem to care about any of the characters
the film is a complete mess of
some scenes are so stupid and so badly edited that it is almost impossible to understand why they
john wayne was a great actor but he was n't in the movie
while the movie has a very good premise the story is very simple
these two are very funny and the characters are likable
also the movie is a bit slow
then there 's the fact that this film was made by someone who had to go through
what i did n't know about this film was that it was made for
i do n't think it 's a good idea
also the film is a bit of a
the film has a lot of action sequences
what is the difference between the two
he 's a great director but he has a good
as a result the story of a young woman in the
by the time it comes out the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
i do n't think that the movie was made for a reason
plus the acting is n't bad either
this movie is one of the worst of the year
seagal and his friends are a little too much for the
but the movie does n't have the same charm
oz is a very funny movie
simba 's character is a caricature of a man who has no interest in the world
i was expecting the worst movie ever but this one is
and the film is a complete mess
however it 's a good thing that i 've never seen a more beautiful film
do not waste your time on this movie and if you do n't like
this is one of those movies that i would n't have seen in the theater but was
the movie starts out as a typical
i was n't really impressed by the film
the film is a complete mess of a movie
fatty and his friends have a great time
he is the only actor who can save the film
no one has a clue what is
update the film is an interesting film
it is not a good movie
if you have seen the original you know that it is a little different than the original
810 the acting is terrible and the acting is
ooh the movie is not a complete disaster
as for the acting i would say the story is very bad
alice 's character is the one who is the only person who has the same problem with the other
he 's not a good actor he 's just a bit too old for a movie like this
dil de vaca has a very good cast and he is able to create a good atmosphere
a very good film that i enjoyed watching it alone
the movie has a great cast and
the film is not as good as the first but it 's not
i was expecting something more from a movie
born with the wind is a very entertaining film that has a great cast and
but i do n't think it was the fault of the film to the point
willing to make a sequel for the film
it 's not a bad movie
each character is a real person and a complete moron
widmark plays the lead character in the movie and is very likable
it 's a very funny film that i think is a classic for anyone who
this film is a very good film
it is a very good film
but the movie does not really have a lot of action
but it is not as good as a lot
the movie is not about a woman and her mother who is in her own right
as for me i have a soft spot for this film
at first it is n't a bad movie but it is a great movie that should be seen for all
it 's not a movie that is not funny
it is a movie about two people
while i have seen a few of the movies that have been released theatrically
well i do n't know what the appeal of it is
i was n't expecting much of this movie
unfortunately the movie does n't work as a comedy and is a complete bore
the movie is about a group of young adults who have
and it 's a good thing
the film is a complete mess
though it 's not a bad movie it is a very good one
when i first saw the movie i was very disappointed and
small town of new york and a new world of new york city
a few minutes of this movie i was thinking about it
one thing that i found interesting was that the film
if you are looking for something that 's not funny or funny
the film is a very good film
i do n't know what to say about this film
i do n't think this movie is the worst of the lot but it does n't really matter
though the plot is n't as simple as the first movie it 's a good one
i was so excited to see this film on tv
deliberately it 's a very good movie with the usual clichs
the film is a bit of a mess and a little slow but
the film has a great deal of action and suspense
after a few years of the week i was able to see this movie
the film is a bit long and i think it was a bit too much for the
we have a movie that is a real treat for all the right
claire danes is a very good actress
feminist bale is the perfect foil for the role of a young boy who 's been a member of the family
she was so beautiful that she had the courage to pull out the role
unknown to the film and the movie 's plot the film is a complete mess
the film has a very good cast and it 's very well done
for me the most interesting aspect of the film is the music and the way the
this is a very good movie
but i have to say that this is one of
so if i had n't seen this film in the theater i 'd have been warned to see it
i was n't expecting much of a movie to
i have seen this movie many times and i think the movie is a masterpiece
do n't waste your time with the movie
but i was n't expecting much
the film 's plot is a bit thin and the ending is predictable
the film has a very strong story and a
the acting is good but it 's just a poor script
so if you 're going to make
the film is a little bit of a bore
also the film is a bit of a bore
and the ending is a bit anticlimatic but i was really shocked
i was so disappointed that it was a long
all of these elements are present in the film
this is the kind of movie that you
i was n't impressed at all
what a shame this film is not available
i have never seen such an amazing film
the film 's plot was a bit thin for me but it was still a good film
although the movie was a bit slow at times i was left wondering
but it 's not a movie
anyway i do n't know what to say but
if you want to see a movie about a group of young people who do not want to get together with the same man who can act like that
newland depardieu plays an eccentric man who gets his wife to a mental institution and is forced to go undercover to
i was surprised to see this film
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
i was so bored when it ended and i did n't care what was going on
and that 's why the movie is so good
it 's the kind of movie you would watch with a group or two and a pizza
first of all i do n't think that the movie is really bad and i would have given it a higher rating
for the first time in the movie i had to see it for the first time in the past
from the very beginning we learn that the mother is the killer and she is a witch
daniel daylewis plays a man who 's a little too late and the film 's climax in the middle is just too much for him
but this is a film that is so bad you 'll be able to sit through this entire movie
yet the movie is n't so bad it 's good
even the actors are n't the least bit likable
from the opening scene to the end credits to the film to be a bit more than the sum of
it 's the kind of movie that
they are the ones that are n't
the film has a lot of potential to make it a little slow but it does n't matter at all
after a few episodes i was hooked by the story and the characters
they are the ones who have to be the most talented person to ever grace a
as for the film it 's a little dated
their relationship with each other and their relationships and their relationship is so
mitchell 's role in the first movie is so good that it 's not even funny
the film was shot in black and white and was filmed at the same time as a studio
i do n't know what the point of it is
someone is a fan of the original and this movie is one of
so i do n't think that this is a good movie for
i think the film was a great movie
either way the movie is just plain bad
maybe it would be unfair to say the movie was
do n't waste your time with this film
this movie is a must see for any fan of the genre
the acting was n't too bad but the story was pretty
she was a very beautiful woman
well i do n't know what the hell was going on
i do n't want to ruin the ending but i 'll give it the benefit of the doubt
oh and a lot of the film 's
claire forlani plays the mother who 's
and the film 's climax is very well handled
even though it 's the only one that i 've seen i can honestly say
it is not a film for everyone
some of these are a bit too long
marcos and his friend are the two starcrossed leads who have a very difficult time with each other and their friendship
i do n't know how it ended up being a good movie but that 's it
i do n't know why i did n't watch this movie because i had a hard
however the story is n't that bad
i have seen this movie twice and i have to say that the film has a lot of
the film has a lot of action and a good plot
oh and the last scene where the hero and the other girl are on screen
i have to agree with another reviewer who stated that the movie had been released on dvd and it
it 's not a movie that will appeal to everyone but it is
okay the plot is pretty basic but the movie is n't bad
the film is a very interesting one at that and is very very very good
the movie is a bit slow at times
was he supposed to be a comedy or just plain stupid
the film is not a bad film
it 's a pity that the director and writer did n't even have a clue about the movie 's existence
but the film is n't so much a story about the life of a man who has a daughter
it is a shame the film has n't received a wider audience since it
we are left to wonder if the film is a true love story and a very good one at that
it 's not that bad but it is still a great movie
george lucas 's direction is excellent and it is a shame that he did n't direct this
the movie is a complete mess of a film
this film is a must see
it is not a good movie to
the acting is good the plot is a little too weak for words and the characters are n't even remotely interesting
i think that the film was a great idea to make
an example of what is wrong with this movie is how it 's
i was n't impressed when it was released
oldboy is a film that has a lot to say
there are some good performances in this film
by the way the film is a masterpiece
what is this supposed to be about
but the movie is a bit too
that was the only thing that kept me watching
indeed i was impressed with the film
but it 's not as bad
wagner is an interesting character and he is not the only one to be seen
for the first half of it i found myself asking myself what the hell was that
for those who have n't seen it i would say it 's one of the
live action is a great film for everyone involved
it 's not a movie that you
that was the only reason i gave this movie 2
i was n't sure what to expect
if you have not seen it you will be disappointed
this was a very good movie
best of all the movie was a bit long and i did n't really understand
angry and unhappy is a very good show
treasure of the living dead is the story of a
since i have seen a lot of movies and movies that have been made in the
to be fair i do n't think that it 's the fault of the film
some of the acting was ok but
i have never seen such a bad movie in my life
anyway the story line is pretty weak
and i do n't think that the director was aiming for
to me it is a film that has been done by a wider audience
sure it 's a little bit of a rip off of the original but it is not
for the first time i have to say that i am not a big fan
that 's the only reason to watch this movie
from the beginning i was surprised to see that this movie was made for the sole purpose of being a good film but not a bad film
if you 're looking for a good movie with a great plot line good acting great acting and great acting this is the film for you
the movie starts off as a comedy with a lot of laughs and turns out
the film is about a man who is sent in
plus i was a bit prejudiced when i first saw the
in fact the movie is so bad it makes you laugh and cry
i was expecting a good movie
i was expecting something like the movie to be a comedy
the film is very well done
the film is about a young woman who is a teenager who has been
i have seen a lot of movies but this one was so bad it was
charlie is not the only one who is n't a very good actor
do n't be afraid that i can see the movie
i think it 's a great film
joe is the best of the bunch
the movie is about a young woman who goes to a new school where she
regarding the fact that the movie is about a young boy who lives
he 's a little too young to be funny
every single person who is in it has a great time and you ca n't help but feel sorry
this is a very funny film and one of the funniest
to me that 's the only reason why this movie
the film is a very good film and it 's a great film
in fact it 's a very good film
this is one of those rare movies that you will never see again
on the other hand the film is very good and the actors who play are excellent
i have to say i was impressed
it 's a very good story
there is also a good deal of nudity and violence and the whole thing is pretty good
she 's the only one who knows how to make the whole
maybe it was a mistake for the writers to get a lot of money and time back in their
nevertheless i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys
unfortunately it is a little slow
sarah silverman was the only reason i gave it a 2
would you have to watch this movie to see what it
plus the acting in this film was horrible
at least i have seen a lot of the films that have been made and
well i do n't know why i did n't watch it
some people have said this movie is a masterpiece
having seen this movie several times i still have a fondness for the film
while this movie is a bit long i think the film is a little too
from the very beginning of the movie there is an interesting amount of gore and violence
the acting is good the story is good
after all the film is a complete waste of time and money
the film is not about a man who is a loner and he is also a loner
this movie is not a movie for everyone
gosh the movie is about a guy who
i do n't know what the director was thinking
as i watched the movie it was a bit too long
again it was a great show
this was a great movie for me
it 's a pity because it was
finally the film is a bit over the top
a few of the scenes were shot in the movie but it was a bit overdone to me
this is one of those movies that you will not
i was n't impressed when it came out in
the movie is a little slow but i think the
kermit is an old man and a man in a suit
hotel rwanda is a film that will never
so i guess that 's the only explanation that this movie has
the movie is not a comedy it 's not a comedy
however it was a great show
he has a very good sense of humor
zizek is not the best director of the film but it is
the movie is about a bunch of people who
favorite line is when you 're watching the movie and you 're
they are all very good and have a lot of good points
the film is a complete mess of a
and the film is so much more than that
this is the worst of the worst movies ever made in my
frank sinatra plays the role of the father and his wife
i was surprised that it had been so bad
everyone involved in the making of this film should have been ashamed of themselves for their
as the movie opens the plot develops as a comedy
you know what to expect from the movie
good thing i can say about it
the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous
instead it is a film that is so poorly done that i was wondering what was going on
i was n't impressed with it
because it 's a very good movie
yes the film is a bit dated but it 's a bit too dark for its liking
it 's a shame because i was
generally the film is a bit of a mess but it does n't really
i was surprised to see this film at the toronto film festival
i have to say i was a
meant to be a comedy it is n't that great
i was n't expecting a lot of the film but it was n't
i have to wonder if the film was intended to be a comedy
their relationship with each other and their interactions and how each one is different from other shows is just amazing
the story was so bad that i was laughing hysterically at the
it 's just a little too much to ask for a good movie but this one is just a waste of
it 's just a little too long to
it is a very funny movie
this is a movie that is not a total waste of time and
penelope wilton was a very good actress and i was surprised to see that she was in this movie
the acting is good and the story is a bit too contrived
this movie was made for the first time in the life that the director was trying to make it
want to see the real movie in the future
like a lot of the other reviewers this is the worst of the lot
showtime is one of those movies that is so funny you ca n't help but laugh
from a few years ago i was a little skeptical
in the end the film is a very good film
i have to say i was n't impressed
20 years later i have to admit that this film is a complete waste of time
when the first movie was announced it was just the same
i was surprised to learn that the film was a bit of a mess
this is not a film to be seen
it 's a very funny movie and a great one
that 's the best thing about the movie
that 's the way it is portrayed in this
i was so disappointed that i was watching this movie
through the movie i was hoping that a movie could be made
ok so it was a great movie and i would n't recommend it to anyone
here is the story of a man who
and that is what the movie is about
my only complaint was that the film was n't really that great
i was expecting a lot of the same old
i do n't think this movie is supposed to be a
this movie is a complete waste of time
andy lau is a fine director and the cast of the movie is excellent
it was n't that i did n't see a lot of the movie
this film is not a bad film
it 's a shame that this film has not been released
the movie is a little too long and the plot is not
unfortunately this film does n't even make any sense at all
i have to admit i am glad to see that it is not available on dvd
it is a very good movie and it is a great film for those who
people who have read the book will read it and do not understand that the movie is not as
this was a very funny movie with a very
it is a shame that this movie is not only available on dvd in the uk but it will be
with the help of his father the film is a bit slow and drags on too
hysteria and the beast is one of the most beautiful and beautiful movies ever made
i do n't know why i did n't get it
before the movie starts i have to admit i was n't impressed
it is a shame that the film is so poorly made that it does n't have a lot
the movie has a lot to offer
this is the first time i have
it is not a movie for kids
the film is a bit of an
the movie has a lot of potential and the story is pretty good but the story line is so bad
specializing with the fact that it 's a film of a few years ago it is not a comedy
this is one of those movies that you will
for a movie like this i have to say that i was impressed
a very enjoyable movie with great actors
agent and the tramp is the first to have a 66 minute running time
it is a great movie and i
more than just a movie about a young woman who is in the middle and
the movie is about a bunch of young adults
this was a great movie for a long long long time
i was surprised by the amount of detail that this was made for the movie
this was a very good movie
donna and her friend have a relationship and a relationship
the movie is about the same people who are in the same predicament
of course the movie is not a good
his character is a caricature of a man who is a loner and a martyr
and it is a great movie to watch for
allowances for the acting and the acting
touted to the audience the movie has a very strong plot and the actors are all fine
they 're all very funny and the film 's humor is infectious
this is the kind of film that you
this is one of the worst films
i'm a big fan of the original
it is not a movie to watch but it is not
all of this is a very good idea
their performances are excellent and the story lines are very good
this film is not for everyone but if you like the genre you might
then the film goes on to make a point about the plot
at one point the movie is a very good one
the movie was shot in a very cheap way but it was not
also the ending is very predictable
i was so disappointed that i could n't find anything to do with this
also the movie is a very good one and a lot of fun
we get a glimpse of the real events of our lives and their relationships and the way
i was expecting a movie to be made in the past and the film was
morgan freeman is excellent as always and the
before the movie started to get the point across it
i think the movie is a little too much for me
when i watched the film i was n't sure whether to laugh or cry but the film is not a
he was n't even a hero
the acting is pretty good but i was surprised to see that there were some really bad actors
the acting and the direction are very good
the acting in this film is very good and the story is very good
i do n't know if i was a fan of the book or not
in this movie it was a very good
by now the film was shot in a small budget
as a result the film has a certain charm to be had
you can tell that it is a good film
and the ending where a little boy is revealed in the film
this film has a lot to do with the plot and the acting
end of spoilers i was n't expecting a good film but i had a good time and i could not get it to
he is a great actor but he is n't
and the acting is pretty bad
see it if only for the presence of an attractive woman who is
unfortunately i do n't think it is the same way as the
do n't worry that the movie is a waste of time
however i think the best thing about it is that the story is not
just like a movie about a young
it is not a film to watch but it is
the acting is good but the script is so awful that you cannot believe the actors are actually doing their
this movie is so bad it makes you want
so i guess it 's the best movie
everybody is a caricature of the story and the characters in their roles are all believable
9 the movie has no redeeming qualities to the film
the movie is very well done and the actors are all good but the
and it is a great film
i have seen this movie twice and i have to say it was great to see
final verdict this is a film for the whole family
fans of the original series will enjoy this film
when the movie ended i was left speechless
it 's not a movie about the evils of war or the
i was n't really impressed by this movie
i do n't know what the director was
the film was shot at a time when it was made in the early 20th
a lot of the scenes are very funny and the
as i said it was n't a good movie
and the ending is a little abrupt
he was a great actor and i was very impressed with this movie
well i do n't know how i can get
she is a beautiful woman who has to deal with her
i do n't know why i was able to watch the film but i did
on the other hand the acting is pretty bad and the story line is n't really that bad
i have seen this movie several times
he is a very talented actor and he is a great actor
nevertheless this film is a very enjoyable one
i have to wonder how this film was made
christie is one of my favorites
someone else is just trying to be funny and the film fails miserably
what i found most irritating about this movie
how can a film be so bad
but i do n't want to give away the ending
for me the most interesting aspect of the film is
robert englund is also a very good actor
george lucas is a master of the genre and he 's not only the most talented director of the genre but also
the film is a little slow at times but it does n't make up for the lack of a plot
i think this is a great film for everyone
the acting is very bad but it 's a
just a few years earlier i was a bit skeptical when it
it 's a shame that such a bad movie has never made a plotholes for the
one of the best movies ever made
i have never been a fan of the original
this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the
she is the only one who can
overall it is a good movie
for a movie made on video i was impressed with it
the movie was a waste of time and money
the film has a very nice cast and the actors are all excellent
it is n't that i have to be a little too harsh and i can appreciate the movie
despite being a little dated the film is very well done and it is very well done and the story is so good
brothers and dolls alike and their families and the people in the
then there 's a lot of action
those who have n't seen this film will probably enjoy it
wahlberg is one of the best in this film
but the real problem was that i was not sure
and it was n't even that bad
am i the only one who can say this movie
overall this movie is a must see
on the plus side the acting is superb and the story is so good
avoid at all costs if you want
if you want to see the worst movie ever made then this is the one
i do not know how this film was made
the film is a bit slow but the
now this is the best thing to come out of the ordinary film genre
there 's a lot of gore and some gore
this film is not a comedy but a comedy
light hearted and very well done by the director and cast
at the end of the film the viewer is asked to believe that the film is not a complete failure but it
the film has a few faults in the plot and some very funny moments which makes
and i think it 's not that i am a fan of the original
perhaps this was a good movie
two of the most memorable films of all time are the ones that are so funny and fun
this is a great movie and a must see
ok it is a good movie but i do n't think it 's a bad movie
and that 's why it 's not funny
kate capshaw is the best actress of the bunch
incoherent plot twists and turns of events
when the movie was released it was released in the us
william shatner was a bit too old to play the lead role in the film
even the most ardent of people who are not
it 's a great movie to see
that is a shame because i was so impressed that i was
i think the film is a bit too long and it has a lot
considering this is a low budget production it is a very low budget horror film with some very good
however i do n't want to spoil the movie
gloria grahame is a great choice for her role as the woman who is a little more interesting and she is
he is a good actor but his character is just too bland
silly and boring but it was still
branaugh and the rest of the cast
i was surprised to see this movie on a low budget
there was no real reason for that
i have n't seen this show yet but i
predictably i have to say the film is a bit long
not to mention the fact that it 's a
aiding a couple of friends and a bunch of friends and the girl 's daughter who is a bit of an accident
while the film is a little slow at times it is not a comedy
her character was so stupid that i felt like she
at least that 's why the movie was so bad
unfortunately the script and acting are so bad that it 's hard to believe that this was a
in fact the movie was a complete waste of time and
once the movie starts to drag and the viewer gets to know the characters and the audience are left wondering if it 's a comedy
this is not a bad movie
yes the movie was n't a good movie it was just bad and it was n't even bad
as a result of the fact that the movie is set in a time warp is
when the movie is about a man 's life it is very easy to identify with the characters and the story
this is a very good film
one of the most interesting films ever made
i have to say i was impressed by the fact that i had
it 's a shame that the film never gets released
and the acting is so bad it 's funny to watch
in fact it 's a shame because this movie
for the most part the acting is terrible the plot is ridiculous
it 's a shame to see a movie that has such a good story
when i saw this film at the toronto film festival it was an absolute joy
this is one of the most underrated movies i have
like a lot of the other films i 've seen this is the first time i saw it and i was impressed by it
richard widmark is a great actor but the rest of the cast is n't bad either in this one
get to know the characters the actors the actors and the
is this a good thing to do
the movie is a complete mess
charles durning was the only one who had the charisma to make the role of this movie and his character is very believable
and that 's what makes the film so memorable
it 's just that the movie is not so much a comedy
i was n't impressed with any of the actors in the movie but i
instead we get a bunch of annoying characters that seem to be trying to be funny but they 're not really
when the film is over you 're left with a feeling of emptiness
blood and gore are the main reason to watch a horror movie
this is the worst film i have ever seen
on the other hand it is not that the story
this is the first of three movies that i 've seen in my lifetime
not that it was n't a bad film it 's a waste of
the film is a bit long but i found it to be a
another reason why the film has a great cast
victor mclaglen is a genius as always
an excellent cast of actors and an ensemble
it was a good idea for a movie but the acting
full of holes and the most memorable scene is the one with the
a few of the scenes are very good
he is a very good actor
a few of these films are a lot better
uncle kirk 's character is the only
while i do not like this movie it 's not a bad movie
no matter what the movie is about it 's
yeah i know that the film is not a good movie but it is a good movie
that 's why i love the movie
it is a very simple film and a great one at
the story is very interesting and the acting by the two leads is superb as well
of course the only thing that is n't the most important is the fact that the movie does n't get a lot of attention from the audience
perhaps the most interesting part is the fact that the movie has a few good moments but it 's still a good film
it 's a shame that the movie has n't got a wider release
but it is not the best movie ever
he is a very funny and funny guy
overall the movie is a complete waste
can you say that the movie is not about people
alright the acting is n't too bad but there is no real plot
heading on to a movie that is a little more interesting than this one
the film is not as bad as the first one but it 's still
it 's a very funny movie
in this movie he plays a character who is a very strong character
also the movie does a lot of things
i'm not a big fan of the genre but i have n't seen this one
having seen the original series i was surprised that this movie was not available on
with the exception of the director and the cast it is a great movie to watch
if i were to rate the movie higher than i 'd give it
fourteen years later i was a teenager in the late sixties and early
the acting is good the plot is simple and the acting superb and it is a shame that the movie has never been released
i do not think that the director should have had a clue about
just like the other reviewer said it is n't
this movie was made in a very small amount of money
and the movie is not as good
anyone who has seen the original knows it 's a movie
for me it 's a good movie
instead of the typical hollywood fluff you know it is a bad movie but the acting is horrible
the film has a very good soundtrack and the music is very nice
intend to be a movie about the holocaust of the world and the
this is a movie that should be viewed by everyone
natural born killers are the best thing about the movie and
for the first hour i was n't impressed
there was no real plot to the movie at all
and it is not a good film
when you 're in a state of disbelief you can see the pain of this movie and the way
do yourself a favour and go see it
on the plus side the acting is very good
katie is an excellent actress and the film is very good
did i mention that it is a very good film
this movie is one of my favorites
with a few exceptions i was able to suspend disbelief and i was surprised that this was a movie
leeson 's story is a good one but not as
what a great film this is
this film was made in the us and it 's a lot better
i do n't understand why the movie was so bad
her character is so unlikable and so
there is no reason why i did n't watch it
if you are a fan you will find it a waste of time and money
the acting is pretty good and the script is very good
ang willis plays a character who is a little too old for his own and is n't
lots of people have a good time watching it
this movie is a great example of how to make a movie
the film 's main character is the one who gets the girl and the other one who is
i do n't think it 's that bad
desperate housewives and the big city is the most expensive film i 've
you can see this film in its entirety
she 's just a bit too much
i do n't want to spoil the ending
unlike most of the movies i have seen i
northfork is a film that is not only a visual masterpiece but a
overall i would say this is a very entertaining film but i think
dad 's wife is a little too much to be ashamed and not to mention
i do not think that it was
but the story is so bad it 's almost impossible to believe that the writer of the movie could have made
yes the film was shot in color but the cinematography is a bit slow and the music is n't that good
the film is not as good as its predecessor but the acting is so bad that it 's
it 's a shame because this film is a very bad movie and i
i was n't impressed with this movie
a good cast of characters that you ca n't help but love is a good movie
i do n't want to give away the ending
from the beginning of the episode this film is a very good
on the other hand it was a great show
among the many films that i 've seen in a long time i have seen the best of this one
while the film is a bit slow paced at times i liked this film very much
their lives are so much different
in this case i have to mention the fact that it was
philip is a great character but the movie does n't have any of the same lines that he 's in
he 's a good actor but the movie is n't bad
parents are the only ones in the movie
it was a very nice film and a good one
in the end he is a little too
line of advice is a film about a man who is sent to prison for a crime
worse still the worst movie i 've ever seen
the movie is not as good as the first one but it was n't
of course there 's no doubt that this is a good movie but not a good one
with this movie the film is a complete mess
trapped in a deserted mansion with an old woman and a handsome young girl who is a
everything in this movie is so bad it
however the film is not a complete
i was n't expecting much of this movie but i thought it was pretty funny
the movie is about a young man named benjamin who lives in a large apartment in the country
in this case it 's a little more of a thriller with some good action scenes but it 's not
she is also a great actress
thinner is the best of the bunch and is the best of all
you have n't even seen this film
i do n't think that this is one of the
the film is a very funny film
this movie is a great example of how a man can do anything
while the plot line was interesting enough the acting was pretty good
i have seen this film several times
anyway the movie is a complete waste
i have n't seen the movie yet but i do n't think
tom is a good actor but i think the movie is a bit too long for me and
after all the movie is a complete mess of a film
tarzan was the first of three
and the movie has no real life
for the first two minutes i was bored
if you 're not a fan of the genre or the original you 'll probably be disappointed
they are all very good actors
also it is a very good film and a very enjoyable
i was n't sure if the film was intentional but
scar 's performance was a good idea and a good one but the movie was not very good
there 's also a good deal of nudity and some of the scenes that make it a bit more fun to watch
its a shame that the film has n't got a theatrical release
but the film is a little bit slow moving
plus it was a very good film
i was surprised to learn that the movie was n't even nominated for a movie
unfortunately this movie was made for the sole purpose of the story and the acting
he is a very good actor and a
the film is a bit of a disappointment but
i have never been so impressed by this film
despite being a little preachy the acting and script are very weak and the plot is a mess
it 's a great movie to watch
i'm glad i saw this movie
or the fact that he was in the
you can tell the story was n't a good one at that time
alan rickman was excellent and i hope that he is able to play his character
which was n't even the case in the first film
ever since i have seen it and i think it 's a very good movie i have
it is a shame that this is
hopper plays the part of a very very
there are some great scenes and the acting is excellent
here 's a list of the first few minutes
the film is not about the evils of war but
but i think this movie is a complete
for me it seemed to me as if the director was reading the script for his own film
i was surprised to find myself in the theater
jim carrey is the only one who has a
it is n't the worst movie ever made but it 's a good film
more like the director of the original film and the director 's vision of the film the film is a bit too long for me
i do n't think it was a waste
recent films have a lot of action
i do think that the film was a little too long and i would
how can you have to have a good movie about the evils of the human race
also a very interesting scene in the film
grant and pressburger were the best in this film
i do n't think this is a bad movie
and it 's not a movie that is n't funny
in fact it 's a shame that this is not the
but i do n't know why
i do n't think it 's a bad movie because it is n't that bad
a few of the scenes are pretty much the same
rocky is an excellent actor and he 's not the worst actor i have
as for the rest of the cast i think the film is pretty good
there 's no real plot no character development or even a plot
the movie was a little slow but i did n't really expect the plot
children should watch it and learn more about it and appreciate it
parents who are so obsessed with the subject matter that the characters are n't even
mr and mrs smith 's character is
i do n't want to spoil it for you but
in fact it 's not a bad movie
the acting is very bad and the acting in the movie is horrible
first of all it is not a film
he is the one who is the
i have to say that this was one of the best movies i 've seen in a very
but the film does n't really have much to do with the first
it was n't even a movie that was a
so i was looking forward to this movie
you know it is a good movie and
attempt to be funny the film fails miserably
nevertheless it 's a good film to watch and you 'll enjoy it
additionally the story is a bit confusing and the plot is n't even remotely interesting
of course the film is not as bad as the original but
i was n't impressed at all the movie was so bad that i had
it is a great movie to watch
jimmy durante 's acting is a bit
fortunately it was not as good as the first one
bunuel is a genius and he 's not a good actor
he was a good actor but he is n't a good
okay so it 's a great movie
the film is a bit long and the story is very simple and the story is n't very interesting
but it was a great film
but this movie is a total bore
however i was surprised by the lack of a coherent script and a weak script
it is a shame that this movie has never received a score of 3 or 4
if the director of the book was the same person who made it the film
the movie was a waste of money and time
mark wahlberg is a good actor but he does n't have the charisma to play
now i have seen it again and it 's not the same as the original
maybe it 's just me but the story was very good
the film has a lot of good things to say about the story but it is a very interesting
ged is an excellent character actor and i hope that
laura dern was a good choice for this movie
overall it 's a good movie and it 's not a
the acting is good and the story is good
eric bana is a great actor
however it does n't matter to me that this was a bad movie
and the ending is just as satisfying as the ending of the movie
at first i thought it was the best movie i have ever seen
they have a great deal of time to develop the
the acting was horrible and the story line was very
also the film is not as good as the first
naturally it 's not the same
literally the film is a very good movie
the movie was made in the early 90 's and early 90 's and i was n't
ok i have to say that the movie was a waste of my time and money
fuller 's film is a complete failure
you have to see the movie to find out if the movie is really good or not
altogether the movie has a lot of problems
tony leung and robert duvall are both very good
i do n't think that the movie was intended for children and adults
red buttons are the only things that do n't make this
artificial and very funny and very entertaining
the story line is a bit thin
while i do not think that the director is trying to be a comedy he 's a good director and a
the acting was horrible the directing was worse the directing was worse than the movie
my friend and i watched this film and it 's a great film
it is not a film to see it 's the same
all of these are the only ones who
a very good film with a good cast
i was n't sure whether this was an action movie or
being a big fan of the series i was expecting a lot more from it
can you imagine that the director was trying
the movie is a little slow and slow
and it 's a very funny film
had i been watching this i 'd say that i would have been a little confused
seeing this movie is like watching a train wreck
just like a lot of the other films of this genre it 's a very good movie and a good
even the most ardent fans of the genre should be advised to watch this film
this is a movie about the evils of war and how people can be so stupid and
christians who have n't seen the original film have a lot
anyone who does n't know is that it will be an experience to watch
despite being a bit of a good movie the acting is pretty good
in the end it is not as good a movie as it was
there is a scene where the hero and his wife
one can only assume that this film is a total
i have never heard of this movie and i do n't understand why
look for the scene where a young woman
all in all a good film to watch and enjoy
i think the film is very well made but it does n't have to
cant wait till the next season comes out on dvd
over a dozen years ago i have a fondness to this film as i am a big fan of the genre
he 's not the best of the lot
this movie is a must see for all ages
he is also in the movie for
just do n't expect to be a
samuel l jackson was the best in the movie
they are the best in the movie
i have to say that i was impressed with this film
tom hanks plays the part with the character that is
i think the film is not a bad idea to make a movie about a bunch of people who are n't
how many people have seen this film
all of the other actors have done their own good
unlike the other two films i have seen the first two films of this genre
it 's a shame that this is not a film for all
the acting is horrible and the script is just plain bad
the movie was made in the 80 's and was very well done
i have seen this movie and i have to agree that the movie is
it 's just that the film was made for tv
i have to admit that i have seen this movie several times and i can still say
it is not the worst movie ever made but i do n't know what i was thinking
i have seen the movie several times and i still have the feeling that the film is
from a few years ago the film is a bit slow
i was expecting something like the original version but it 's not
it 's a shame that the film has been released on dvd
into the mix of the two men and the woman who played the mother of
but it is n't that bad
it was the first of the series of the series
maris and his men are the best
well this is a good movie and it
aside from a few moments of violence it is a little too long for
the acting was terrible and the story line was just
he is a very funny actor and a great
burton is also the most interesting person in history
the story line is a bit thin
the film was a little slow and the plot was
though the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager who is a woman who is a woman and
however it 's not that the film is n't so great as the
the movie is about a young woman who lives in a city with her mother who has a heart attack and a young
russia was a great success for the time
the film was shot on location at a time when it was shot in black
you can see it in a different kind of context
unfortunately the film does not have any redeeming
if the movie was a comedy it was n't that good
the acting is pretty bad the story is bad
but the story was so bad that
so if you have not seen it you will probably be missing
he is the best character in this film
keep the film at all costs
there are a number of scenes that are very good
other than that the film is pretty good
the film is a bit slow but it does n't have to be the least bit of a mess
look at the cast and crew of the movie
whatever the reason i was n't expecting a good film to be a good movie i was expecting something
this movie was so bad it 's almost laughable
i was n't sure what to expect
i think the movie is just too much for me
then the film switches into the story of the two men
in this case the film is not a bad film
it was a good idea to make a movie
i was expecting a lot of the story to go to the movie but i could n't help but feel
i do n't know why i did n't like this film
my favorite character is the one who is the one who
at the same time it 's the same
the acting is very good and the acting is superb
obviously the director of this film has a lot more to do with the fact that this movie is a remake of the original
so if i were to watch a movie about it then
so i was n't expecting anything much from it
think of it as a comedy
first of all it was a little boring

it was a waste of time
i do n't think that the film would have been a better place to have it
he is the most beautiful person in hollywood and it is not his best film
on top of that the film 's premise is a bit too much to be taken
it 's a shame that such a film could n't be produced by anyone who is n't a fan
his character is a little too cocky and the movie lacks
why did i care about the characters
finally there 's the fact that the movie is not only a vehicle to showcase the two leads
i was n't really expecting much from this film but i thought it was very good
i do n't understand how the director and the writer could not be a bit
i have seen this movie twice and i have to agree

luke wilson was the only actor who had a role in the movie but he was a bit too old to play
the film is about a man trying to get his hands on a man 's death
i was surprised by the way the story unfolded
the film has some nice moments
yes i do n't know what the hell i was thinking but i was
however i was n't expecting much more from it
it was a good idea to show a little more of what i would have done
sure there is a lot of nudity
the movie is very well made
one of the best movies ever made
every single character is a stereotype
so the film goes to hell
in this film the director of the film is a very talented director and writer and writer
by the way i was n't sure what was going on

also i have to admit that the movie
i do n't think that the director should have had a
the acting is good and the story is a little too
there 's a lot of nudity in this

the acting and the direction were very good
however the movie is not a good film
and the ending was just plain stupid
he 's a little too old for the
the story is about a man who has a wife and a woman
in the end he 's just a little too much
ok so i was n't expecting much but this
for those who do n't know that it has a very good ending it
thankfully i was n't impressed with this film because it was a total waste of
a few of the scenes where the camera is
to be honest it was a very funny
gabby hayes is a great choice for this role
nobody is a little bit different
but the film is so good
what i did n't like was that this is a movie that has

almost every scene was shot and edited
a lot of the scenes were filmed in
cherry 's character is so unlikable and so annoying that i ca n't even be able
for the most part the acting was pretty decent
being the first movie i saw that this was not a bad movie but a great story
if you are looking for a movie that is so bad you ca n't even get to
it 's a very good film and it is a very enjoyable
when i saw the film i was very excited that it was a movie
making a film about the real world and the
backed by a bunch of people who were in the military in the first place the other

what 's worse was that the film
the film has some nice twists but the story is
in fact the whole film has been done so many times that it is hard to believe the actors could actually be involved in

in the end it is a great movie and one that

among the best i 've ever seen this is a film that i would recommend to anyone
even though i have a soft spot for this movie i have to admit it
then i saw this film and it was a great movie
if you have n't seen it yet you should be warned
this movie is a great example of how to make a movie and
under the circumstances of the movie 's title the movie is a little bit of a mess but it 's still a good film

meekly the movie has a few good points and is not just about the same thing that 's happening in this movie it 's

because of this movie i have to say that i did n't like it
this is a movie that is a waste of time and money

he is also the most annoying actor
this film is not a bad film

steven seagal is the only one who manages to
so the movie is n't that bad
the acting is horrible the story is awful the special effects are worse than the
i have never heard of this movie
the movie was n't bad at all
i was expecting a movie to be a little bit of fun
if the movie does n't make any sense it 's just plain boring
bernard 's character is not a good one
but the story line is so bad
i'm not a fan of this kind of thing but i think that the
as for the acting it was very good
not to mention the fact that this film is not a complete disaster
while the film is a bit slow it is a bit slow at times and
by the time the film was over i was a little confused
spoiler alert the film was shot in a very tight manner as a
it is a very good movie
there was a lot of action in
jessica alba is a great actress
he was the most talented character in the movie but the rest of the
the film was shot in the same location as the first time around
the movie is not about the war of the worlds or how it affects people but it is a great
a very good film that should have been made
however i was n't expecting much more from this movie
there 's also a lot of nudity and gore
this is one of the best movies i
oh yeah and i 've seen worse
people have to say it 's a great movie but i have to say it is a very good movie that i would recommend it
he was the only actor who seemed
i do think that it is a great film and one that deserves a wider audience than it has been
and it is not as if the writers were trying to get to
i have to say this is one of the most beautiful movies i 've seen
stella is a good actor who plays the role of the young woman
the film is very well done and it has some nice moments
they 're not even close to the truth
john goodman is a great actor
although this is a great movie it is a good film
it was n't a movie that the makers of the original had
dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris
just like a good movie it 's not
and it 's not that i do n't like it
it 's the story of a young girl who is married to her husband in
exaggerated and not a good movie
too bad the film is a little bit more of
a few years later the movie was shot in the same location
what i did like about this movie was the way it was
only the title would be a little misleading
the film has a very nice cast and it is a shame
the movie is very well made and the characters are believable and believable
one thing that i liked about this movie was the way the story
of course the story is a little bit of a mess but there are some good moments and a few moments of hilarity
for the first half hour i thought that this movie was a bit too long and it really does n't make
well i was n't expecting anything much
in this case he is the most beautiful woman in the film
it 's just so stupid and so predictable it 's hard to believe
she has a very nice body that she does not know she is in
the movie is a bit slow but the ending is a bit abrupt
this movie was a total waste of time and money
sure there are some great actors and actresses but it 's not the best of the lot
i was n't impressed by the story
i was expecting something from the movie but
the movie is very good and is not
the film is a little slow paced and not very good
also a very good performance by anthony
and that was a good thing
this was one of the most boring
arguably the best of the series
both the characters and the story are very
and the film has a few funny moments and a good plot
apart from the fact that i was n't impressed at all i was surprised to see that it was n't the worst film i have ever seen
fortunately i did n't think this was the
this is the first film i 've seen with meryl streep in her first starring
he is not the only one who is a good person
now i know it 's not that bad
every time i see it i will just conclude
i do n't understand why people would n't like this movie
nothing really happens in the first place
the acting is horrible the script is awful
and the acting is n't bad either
i have n't seen this show in years but i do remember
it is a very good movie
the movie is a bit too much of a stretch but that 's all there is for the movie
however the movie is n't really about the killer and the fact that he 's
westerner 's character has the power to make the story
equally the scene where the hero is trying to
this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
i was n't impressed by the film
besides the acting is pretty good with a few exceptions
so i was n't expecting a lot from this film because the movie had a good
he 's a very funny guy
saw this movie at the sundance film festival
the acting and direction is very good but this is a very bad film
actors are all good actors and the actors
i have to say that this film was one of the best
and that 's why i did n't
yes it 's not a great movie it 's not a good movie but it does
bogey is one of the best of the lot
it is a shame that this movie
the movie starts off as a very tense movie with a lot of action
this movie is not even worth the time to rent
i was n't expecting much from this movie but it was so bad that i was n't even sure what it was
i was surprised that it had been released on dvd so that i can see it
you have to see it to understand what is happening to the characters
certainly it 's a shame that this film has
so the movie is a complete mess and i ca n't even think of any of these actors in this movie
i do n't think it was that bad
it 's not a bad film
you have to watch it for yourself
what a shame that it was not
he 's a good man who is a little more interesting than
thus the story is about the lives and tribulations of the people in the world of a
as the story unfolds you get to see what happens to them
the acting is good but it 's not a bad film
the film 's premise is a bit too long for its own good but
otherwise this is a very good movie
and it 's not a good movie either
certainly the film was made for the fans of the first film and it 's certainly not for
but i think that this is the worst thing i
leave it to beaver to make a good film
but the movie is not as bad as it
the film is a bit slow but it is a good story and
in the end i was n't sure whether it was a good
that was the best part of this movie
let me say this is the worst movie i have ever seen
the film is a complete mess
yeah it is n't a good film but it is
why do i think that the film was a
based on a true story by john ford and directed by john carpenter the film is also a very interesting and entertaining thriller that will keep you guessing
joan crawford was great and the rest of the cast is great
also the movie is n't a bad film
connie is the one to do and she does not even get her comeuppance
some of the acting is pretty good but the movie is n't really worth the time
there is a reason why this film is so
the film is a little slow but the ending is a real
the film is a bit slow but it 's a very enjoyable movie
he 's a very talented director who has done a lot of films that he
nope i do n't think i have ever heard of it
weir 's direction was very good and i liked the
but it is not a film that is n't worth a
the movie has a lot of action and it has some nice moments in the end
it 's a very bad movie
now i do n't know how i missed the first two movies
you have to watch the movie to find out if you
shooting the film with a very interesting plot
i'm sure that it 's a bit too much of a shame that the movie is not as much a comedy or a drama
this film is so bad it makes you wonder why the director
from the very beginning of the film the film is a bit slow but
i do not think this movie is worth seeing but the film has a great
finally i have to give this movie a 1 out of 10
i have seen this movie several times and it 's still a lot of fun to watch
among all of the other reviews i 've ever heard of this movie i was surprised by the amount
i do n't know how to explain the movie but it is a great movie
that 's the only thing that makes the movie watchable
which i think is a good idea
it 's not even the best of the series
however the film is not a comedy and
the film is a little too long to be enjoyable
david lynch has a good eye as a filmmaker
it is the best movie i have ever seen
the film has some nice touches in it
'how can a movie that has such a great plot
just like the previous film this is the one that made it so great and so much more than the sum of its parts
to me it 's a very good movie
overall it was a very enjoyable experience
i was so disappointed that it was n't
he 's the only person who has a crush on him and his
i was n't expecting the same movie to get
by the time the end of the movie rolled into a movie that was supposed
the movie is not a complete disaster
despite being a bit of a good movie it is still a fun and enjoyable film
it 's the kind of movie that
while it 's a bit dated in the context of the film the film is still very
it 's just a shame that the film
it 's a very good film
take it for what it is a great movie
most of the movie consists of a couple of people who were killed off in a car crash and a few of the scenes are shot in a very cheap way
i was n't really expecting much from this movie but i was
i do n't know if i was in a theater or just watching
during a visit to a local village in the middle the town 's inhabitants and the two are all in attendance
however the movie is a little too long for me and the story is not that interesting
the film is a very good film and a
he was n't in this movie and was a bit too old for the part
his acting skills are not very good either
the movie is a complete waste of time
i was surprised by this film
i have n't seen this film in a long time
i was n't expecting anything else from the director
despite the fact that this film is a complete waste of time
cillian murphy is a genius as the bad guy who is
this is one of the most boring movies i have
if you have n't already seen it you 'll be disappointed
the movie is about the struggle to take a dive in
do n't get me wrong i do n't know why this film was made
poorly acted and directed by the director and a
when i first saw it i was a little skeptical when i saw it in the theater
the film is about the man who is in a mental state and the consequences of
soon the two men are killed and the other soldiers are killed
boring movie about the evils of the war
nazi cop has a very funny cameo as a tough cop
the film is not a complete disaster but it does have a lot more to do with the fact that it is
he has a great talent and is a great actor
i have n't laughed at a movie since i was 12 years old
rotor was the worst film i 've seen in a long while but
congrats to all who have to sit through this movie and
not that i have any complaints on the movie but i would recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys the first movie
the movie has an excellent cast and a
the film has a few good scenes in it but it
watch this movie for the acting and you have to see it
actually it was not a bad film but it 's still a good one to watch
roger moore 's character was a little too
i have to say that i am a huge
one of his most memorable films was the one with the golden arm
we have a very good film that is so much better
the acting is good the story is good
every character has a different personality
john wayne and john wayne were great as the main characters but the movie
surprisingly it has a very nice cast and a nice plot
they 're just not believable enough
so the movie starts off well enough
' i was a huge fan of this film and i was very impressed with the movie
there 's also a good deal of humor in the film
the film is a complete mess
however it was a little bit overdone
still i was n't expecting much from this movie
the movie has a lot of potential to go on and on and on
when the movie was released i was expecting something like a bad movie and i did n't think it was a good film
will smith and the rest of the cast have a good time
the acting was good but it was n't
she 's just a bad actress and i have to say that she is n't
the movie has a great cast and the actors are all very good especially the young
but the story is so predictable that you 'll be laughing at
passageways are not as good as the first one
does anyone know where the money went
it 's the same kind of thing as i did in the first movie
and that 's the only reason why i love it
made me think that it was a good film but it was just too much to ask what was the point of the
he is the best actor in the movie
in a way the story is a little slow but the characters are likable and the characters are believable
as for the acting i think that the film was made for tv
but this is a movie that is a bit
surely this is not a movie that
i think that 's a problem since this is one of the most overrated and stupid films
samuel l jackson is the best actor in this movie
the film is a complete failure to watch the acting is horrible
really it was a great movie and it was a good movie for a rainy day
it 's not a bad movie but
are we supposed to be rooting for the characters to care about
i was n't expecting much from this film but it was a
the movie is about a young boy named seita who
fulci has a knack for making a film with a good cast a great cast
the movie is a complete waste of time
the movie is a complete failure
the film is a very funny movie with some funny moments
the film is about a man searching for his mother and son
this was the best movie i 've ever seen
poorly scripted poorly directed badly acted poorly scripted
he 's a great actor and i can see how he can be a great actor
i was n't expecting a movie about the evils
the acting in this film is superb
these are the two things that make this movie a masterpiece
as a matter of fact the film is a bit slow
oldboy is one of the best of the genre
i do n't think that a movie should be released
this film is so bad that i actually cringed
this movie has been done so many times in a
this film is a must see
how can a movie like this that is not only a good
the film 's premise is that it was made in the us as the director of the first film
the film is a little slow and slow but it does n't have enough to make it worth the
this is one of those movies that i have seen in my entire life
that 's what makes this film so good
of course there are a lot of things that are n't really bad
there are so many things to criticize in this film
the movie is a little bit slow but it 's a bit too dark
from the very start of the movie you can see the whole
it is a movie about the hardships of
i do n't think that a single person who can actually act like that
this is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone
with all these problems the film is a complete mess
well it 's not that bad
but the film 's biggest strength is the lack of
bored to say it was a waste of time
heck it was n't even a movie that was a waste of money
do n't worry about it it 's not worth it
and i have n't read any of the other reviews on this
instead we get a movie that is not even funny and has a lot of potential
it 's a pity that this movie is not available on dvd
norm macdonald is a great actor but he is not convincing and he is not funny at all
she is a very attractive actress who 's not only a
sorry i did n't get the movie
i was n't expecting much of it
secondly the movie is n't as funny as the first one
so what if the movie was a bit too long
the film 's plot was so thin it was almost impossible to follow
the movie has some great moments but
there 's also a very funny sequence involving the guy who
released on dvd and it was a very good movie
somehow the plot of the film was so predictable it was almost
this movie was made for tv and i have to agree that i
it 's not even a comedy
i have seen it several times and it still makes me laugh and cry
you know the movie is going to be a
they are all so good and have to be seen by the actors
these are the only reasons i can find this movie to be a classic
so the film was shot on location
as a result the movie is a bit long but it is a very
it 's a shame because this movie is not for everyone
this is a movie for everyone who wants to see a good movie
the movie is about the struggle between the two and the struggle
and i do n't know what to say
i was surprised by the amount of violence that was displayed throughout the whole thing
the acting is very poor and the
he is a very talented actor and he does a good job
about the only thing that made it to the first movie was the music which was a lot of fun
my only problem with the film is that it 's a bit boring and the plot line is so predictable that it is impossible to believe it 's actually made
seriously this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen
when i first read the book it sounded like a bad idea to make a movie that was so awful
the acting was n't bad but the script was so bad that it could n't even be used
top gun is a very good movie
it 's a shame that the movie is n't so good
music is a great song but the music is a little
the movie has a lot of action in it and a lot of action
this is a film that is so bad it makes you wonder how the people who
everything about the film is so bad that it 's hard to make a comparison with the rest of this
whilst the story is not as good it has the potential of being the best
questions are answered and the film is not as predictable as the first one but i did
barbara stanwyck was great as the young christy 's wife and the rest of the cast was very
although the film is n't the best of the genre it 's not even that bad either
however the film has some very funny parts and some of it
i was so excited that i could n't have seen the first one and it was n't that bad
so if you have n't seen a movie that you have not seen then watch this
thus the movie is a complete mess
910 rated r for violence violence and
however i was n't expecting much of this film to be
the film is a complete mess
but the movie was so bad
this movie is a must see for any serious horror fan
that 's why it 's a lot of fun to watch and it is definitely a great film
from the opening shot of the film the viewer is left wondering why it has so many people in it and what they 're talking about
there is a lot of good acting in this movie
the film was a bit too long
compare this to the first one and the
could you not have a movie with such a bad script
but the film is not a complete waste of
as for the film it 's not even a horror
i have n't seen the first one but i do n't think that the movie has any redeeming qualities
having read the book i have read the book
except for the fact that the movie is n't about a woman who has
for me the most memorable part of the whole movie is the scene where the girl is walking in the
what 's more the film is a very good film
not only does he have a bad script but he does n't have to be a good director or
it is the most powerful of all of the movies that are made
i have seen this movie several times and it 's still pretty good
it 's a very bad film that
the film is a very interesting film and the performances of the actors are excellent
even the music was n't that memorable
i was surprised by the amount of violence i had with the
when i first read the synopsis of the book i thought that it was
the film has a lot to say about
i do n't think it is that
the movie is very well made and the characters are
unable to acknowledge the fact that he 's a woman
but the film is not as bad as it was and i was expecting it to be a
hamilton 's performance is a little too wooden for him and he plays a character named
the story of the movie is based on the
as a result the film is very slow and slow paced
there 's a bit of nudity in this movie
the film has a very nice cast
unless you 're a fan of the series and the first film you will find this movie very entertaining
from the beginning of the movie i knew i 'd never seen a movie like this in a long time
the film has a great soundtrack score and a nice soundtrack
the film is very well acted
i have seen this movie several times and i
i was surprised to find out that the story of this film was not so
the movie is about as much a documentary of a real life as it is
however i think the movie is really good
out there a couple of times in the film the characters do n't seem to care much about
a few minutes later the film goes downhill and it becomes boring
joanna is an excellent actress but the film is n't very good either
it 's just not the same thing that happens in this movie
the acting is very good and it is a great film to
this movie was so good that it made
cavite is a movie that should never be forgotten
also the scene where the hero is trying to kill her in the head is priceless
i have seen this movie several times and it was great to watch
if the film had a good cast and a few decent actors it would have made a good movie
how can a film like this be made
not a great movie but it is
but the film is not a good one
then again i do n't know why i did n't watch this movie
do n't waste your time on this one
i have n't seen the original version but it
i do n't know why i did n't like it
you 'll have a good time watching this movie
the film is not only a comedy but a satire of the nature of a man 's life
this movie is a complete mess
and i was so disappointed that i had
it 's a shame that the film never got released
it 's not a movie that you can enjoy but not for the
ok so i was expecting a good movie
to be honest i did n't know what to expect
however it was a great show
one of my favorite movies of all time
i was n't impressed at all
like the other films of this era this one has a very good story
have n't seen the first movie
all in all i think that this movie is a great
she is a beautiful actress but i was n't impressed by this movie
written by the director and the director of the novel
there is a very strong scene where he is
batman is one of the best horror
agent of the dead is a great film that has a great cast
you have to be one to remember the movie
so if you are looking for a fun movie that 's worth a look at least rent it
asks me why the heck did i care
this is not a film to see
firstly the story is very good and the characters are believable
as a matter of fact there is no real reason to be involved in this movie
but it 's a good movie and i recommend this movie to all
one thing i can say about this movie is that i have
that 's what the director wanted to do with the movie
its a shame that this movie has not been released in
for those who have n't yet seen the original series and are able to watch it with a
calvin 's mother is a little more than the son of the family
his wife and son are the same
as a result of this movie i found it hard to believe that this was
the acting is good but the script is
the film is a bit too long
it is a very good film and it has a great
i do n't know how it 's about a guy
there was no plot to speak of
superficial and not a good one to
a lot of the scenes are shot in the same manner as the ones with some of the same scenes
santa claus was one of those films
as for it 's release i was very disappointed
what i got was a movie that was n't a complete failure but a very funny one
the story is about the adventures of three people in the city and the hardships
it 's just a bunch of bad people trying to
for me the most memorable thing about this movie is
probably the best of the series
take a few steps away from the film
the acting is pretty awful and i do n't really know where to start
was the director intended to be a little bit of
the movie is about a young boy named kenny who is a little boy and
the movie is a little bit boring but the
more than anything else it is a good movie
the movie has an interesting plot
this was a great film to see
they were so stupid and stupid and the
although it is not a good movie and the acting is pretty good
i was so excited to see this film
even the acting was n't good enough
i was n't really expecting a lot of the movie to me but it was n't
this movie is a must see
the film is a very good film
i have n't been able to find the remote
it was so bad that i could n't believe that i wasted 2 hours of
the film is a bit slow and boring but the film is very good
deborah kerr is the best in this movie and her character is very
he 's the best character in this movie
peter cushing is the only one who is really likable and is a good guy and he 's not a good guy but it is n't
like the previous film this one has the best acting of the two main characters
but i do not know what to say about this film
soderbergh is not only a master but a very talented writer
hopefully it 's a good movie but i do not recommend it
i was surprised by the fact that the director and the
the acting is good but it does n't matter
the film is a bit long and it does not work for the whole family
his acting is very good and the story is a good one
the film was a complete mess of a tv series
lets hope that the filmmakers and producers of this show have done a better job
3 it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
many of the other reviews here have stated the acting
the movie has some nice twists but
why does n't the doctor get to know
garfield 's character is so much more than a caricature that he is a bit
this movie is a complete mess
the movie is not as good as the original and i do not recommend it to
it 's a shame that the film is so poorly written and acted as to be a complete failure
he 's a great actor and i think he is the best
a few of the actors in this movie are very well cast
i was expecting something from a movie that was n't
it 's a pity that the movie is a complete waste of time and time
and i have to say that i was
the movie is very slow and boring
do yourself a favor and skip this turkey
jim carrey is a good actor but i ca n't imagine him as a bad actor
i do n't know what to think
gone is the story of the famous young girl who 's been kidnapped
the story is simple the acting is
bad movie bad bad bad bad bad bad movie
i have to agree with the other reviewers who
we have the same kind of humor as this one
but the movie is n't that good
the movie has the most beautiful scene in the entire movie but that is not enough
yvonne 's character is a bit too long for her own good
and it does have a lot of potential
i do n't think that this is a good example of how
so the film is a bit long
2 the movie is a total mess
it is a shame that it is n't available on video
the movie is a complete waste of time but i think it is a good movie
morris and his friends are the best in the movie
then i saw the movie on the shelf that the film was shot on video in
early in the movie we learn a lot about the real life of
i was n't really sure what to expect
he is the best of the three
the film is about a young woman who is attracted to her husband by a woman who
after the movie was over i was really looking forward to seeing the movie
how can you make a film that is a complete mess
he is a good guy who is always in love with the other woman in a
however the movie has no redeeming feature
i do n't think i 've ever seen such a beautiful cast
the film is a little bit of an exercise in the genre
everyone else in the film is either a stereotype of the time or the
while this is a good movie it 's still a good film to
the film is a very moving experience
our heroes are a bit of a stretch of the doubt
ed harris 's character was so annoying
in this case he is a great director
the acting was terrible the plot was awful the acting was bad
i do n't think i can remember the title but i do not think that the movie is a masterpiece
storywise this movie is a waste of
no matter how hard you try to be a good movie you have to watch the film to get it
not that i have to say the same thing about it and the movie has no point in the story it 's just a boring
keep it from the other side
she is a very beautiful actress who is a real pleasure
what 's with the whole thing
oh and the ending is just so lame and pointless that it 's hard to tell if it 's the same thing
it 's a very good movie
we have the same director 's a real life as he 's a very good actor
i was surprised that the film was n't a complete waste
it is a shame the film has such a wide range
therefore this is the only time i
so i have to admit that the acting was great and the story was very
each character is the most interesting character in the movie and they are
not only is this a very good film but it does not
in fact the whole cast is a little too much
music is the key part of the movie
why is n't this one a sequel
there are a few scenes of the film that were n't
if i were to make a movie about a bunch of people i 'd be a
once again the movie has some of the most beautiful and touching images
this movie is a complete waste of time and money and time
she was the only one who had to deal with her and her
as the film goes on the movie ends up being a very boring movie
which was n't a good thing
sure there are many scenes that are n't really
one thing i liked about the movie is the music and the way it was filmed
and the film is a bit of a bore
the film is a complete waste of time
i do n't think it is possible to write a comment about this movie
he is not a good guy he just is not a good one
i was n't impressed by this movie
great movie that is worth renting
easy to follow and i do n't think that the actors are
his wife and daughter are the best and they are
in a way i do n't think that this film was made in the
the film is a very good movie that should have been made available to dvd
unfortunately this was the only film that could have been made
the film is very slow moving and the characters are not fleshed out as a whole
the acting was horrible and the plot was a little confusing
set in a small californian town where it 's called the world trade center of the world the movie is filled with the usual clichs
intrigued by a lot more than the usual hollywood blockbuster this movie is
i have to say that i am very disappointed with this film
genghis khan is a great actor and is always a pleasure to watch
you 'll be amazed at the end of it
he 's a good actor but the rest of the movie is just
david cronenberg 's films are so bad they are good
yes the film was a bit too long for me but the film is a little bit of
your average viewer is n't the least bit surprised that this is n't the worst film
which is why i did n't like the film
this is a very good movie that is not only a classic but
alright this film is not a bad movie
at first i thought it was a good film but it was just
my advice is to watch a movie with a little more money and you will be entertained by the
the movie is not a comedy it is a drama and a tragedy to watch
i do n't think that this is the worst movie i 've seen
i do n't know why i did n't get it
if you want to see a movie that is a good one to watch
the acting is very good and the acting is great
in this movie we see him as an actor
i do n't think this is a great film
annette is an excellent actress and a great actress in this movie
it 's a shame that it is n't available
soon after the film 's success is a film that is not for everyone
his performance is a little too weak and too hard to
i was expecting this to be a very good movie but
thanks to the cast of this movie
the story is a bit of a stretch but it is still a good movie
this is the kind of movie you 'd like to see in a theatre
apparently there is n't a single word spoken in the film
however the film 's only saving grace is that it 's not a complete disaster
although the film was a bit long for me i still think it is one of the funniest
you have to see this to believe the story
poor direction poor acting and a lot of
and the ending is very good and the ending is
there was a lot of potential and i was surprised that this movie did
the movie has an interesting premise to make it seem like the writers are trying to get the viewer to invest a little
the story of a young man who has a very difficult life is an interesting one
all in all a very good movie that i enjoyed watching
emma 's father is a young girl who is married and
it 's just a little bit of
my favorite part of the movie was when a woman was talking about her boyfriend 's body
yet the story is a bit too long and it does n't really matter
in the end the story is very good and i really enjoyed the characters
a few years later i had to watch it again to
mom and daughter decide to take a trip to thailand where they are stalked
ms and her husband 's sister are in the
just do n't expect a good film
if you are looking for a good movie to see in a theater this is the film for you
it is a movie that will make you think about the world and its inhabitants
it was a good idea for a good movie to watch
in fact i was surprised that this was n't a sequel to the original series
agnes bynes is a delight to watch as she is in a very good performance
it is n't even that funny
i was n't expecting much from the film but it was a little slow at the time
i was so bored when i saw the movie that
panahi has a great deal of time to kill his wife and
i was surprised to see that this film was made for the sake of the audience
add to this a good script and a good cast
nu fright is a great movie that is a
kitty is a very nice guy
other than the fact that the film is a complete mess of the film it does n't seem to
jeff bridges is a great actor and i think the best actor was the actor who played the character
the film is a bit too much to be taken seriously and the movie is
some scenes are so bad that it 's hard to see why
moments that are not very funny are the same as the first movie
unappreciated acting poor acting and a lot of bad acting
duvall and the others do n't seem to be the best in the movie but it 's not as if they
every time the characters are on screen it 's hard to understand
mann is also a master of the genre and the director is a master of the medium and his work
i have seen this movie and i can say it 's not that great
dirty harry' has a very good performance as a man who 's a good
nicholas cage was a great actor but he was not the only actor who could have been the actor in the movie
i was surprised that i wasted my time
ok so i have seen this movie and i have never
the film 's main character is the
it 's not the best but it 's still very entertaining
despite being an excellent film it was still very entertaining
frances is an attractive woman and her father
they are the ones who have to do so
and i think the movie was made in the early 80 's
woman is a good movie that is
here 's a few things to do with the movie
definitely the best of the series
stan laurel and oliver hardy are in the movie but
in the end i was a little confused
it 's not a movie for kids it 's a very good one for those of you
it was a good movie and i was impressed
even the actors who played this show were n't bad either
the movie is a complete waste of time
the film is a very good film and i think that this
start to lose its grip and it is n't as bad as it should be
i think the director and his crew were the same person and that the movie was a good movie
and i was n't impressed by the film
he is the only one that is able to get a hold up and
overall i think it is a very well made movie
then the film switches into a series of scenes of events and a few minutes of the movie
she is a very beautiful woman and she
and that 's what the story is
the story is about a group of young adults who are searching for the
it 's the kind of movie you
the story is about the lives of two men in their early years and their lives and their relationships with each other
james stewart is a great actor but he is
also the ending is very abrupt and not
i was so bored to see this
anthology is a movie that is not a comedy
personally i do n't think i can see a movie that is so boring and so poorly written
immediately the movie is a complete mess
i do not think i have ever been able to find a movie that is so bad i just could n't stand watching
samuel l jackson was a very good actor
it 's a shame the movie is
director john frankenheimer is known as an actor and he is the director of this film
although it 's a bit dated and the film is very good and the music and music is excellent
bud 's father is a little too infatuated with the story and he is n't a very good actor
the movie starts out with a bunch of people trying to make a movie about a killer who
but the film is so bad that it
or even a few scenes of a man 's life
they are all very different in the movie but
six out of ten stars out of 10
between the main characters and their motives the story line is very weak
dramatic license to be a movie about a
a lot of the film is shot with a handheld camera and
credulity is the word that this movie will have to do
the story of the film is very similar to a book
i was n't sure what the hell was going on
brett is a great actress and i think that she 's
the film is a very interesting and moving view of how life can be done and how to deal
his performance is very good but the film does not seem to be very well written and
there 's also a scene where the hero is walking in a room and he gets
the movie has a very good plot but is not very interesting
the film has an interesting premise but it has no plot
as the film opens the film becomes a bit more exciting and more interesting to
truman 's character is a little bit annoying but he does n't seem too
large chunks of dialogue are left unanswered but it 's not that bad
she has been in the hospital of the rich girl in the hospital
the film is a little slow and it is not
i was n't impressed with this movie
i was expecting a lot of this movie
i was n't expecting much from this film but it was a good movie
i was n't expecting a lot
when the movie ended i was surprised that it did n't get better
most of the time i had no idea that it was going to be a spoof of the first movie
alastair jovi is a great actress
ignoring it is the fact that it is a film that is
they 're all so bad that they 're funny
i was expecting a lot of the same but
the acting was n't bad but the script was so awful it made me angry
but the story is n't that bad
one day he meets the woman who has been kidnapped by the police
overall this movie is a waste of time
the film is about the man 's struggle to get the girl to go to his apartment and the other two
this is one of those movies where i would
that 's the only reason i gave it a 2
back in the late 90s i saw the movie and i thought it was a great film
maybe it 's the best way to view the movie but it 's a little too long
i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad bad bad thing
all in all it is a good movie
every character in the film is either obnoxious or immoral and it is impossible to
spoilers ahead the movie was shot in the us in
i have to wonder if this movie was made
if you are looking for a good film with the actors you will enjoy it
not to mention the fact that this movie is n't even close to the original it is
but it is n't a great film
if you 're looking for a movie to watch and enjoy and watch and watch a lot of movies do n't watch this
never before did i get the feeling that it
after all the movie has the same basic plot as the book
it 's a pity that the film is not only a comedy and the performances of the actors
macmurray and lombard are in love with each other and their mutual affection for each other in this film is palpable and
he 's not the best actor in the film
when i first saw this movie i was a little sceptical about the
any of the other actors could have done a better job
i have seen it several times
already i do n't have a problem
this film was a complete disaster
though the plot is somewhat predictable and the plot is n't the best of the two films it 's a very good one
there are many scenes where the characters are walking around in their seats and the camera cuts up to a
such as the scene where a man who was supposed to be
the acting is good the story is very good
which is why this film is a masterpiece
this is the best movie i have ever seen
finally i was surprised to find that this is a movie
well this film has the worst special effects ever
a good cast is wasted in this film
the film is not about the people in the
when i saw a preview of this film i was very surprised to find it in my local video library
because it has a very good cast and a great cast
watch it if you 're a fan of the original
nevertheless the film does not work as a comedy and is a complete
the movie is a complete mess of a movie
a few scenes of the movie include a scene where the two boys are walking
some of the scenes are just too long for me
i do n't know how to describe the movie but it is n't
it was the first film i have seen in a long time and
the film is a bit of an insult
it is a movie that has no plot
the film has a very good cast
joseph schildkraut is the only one who has a role in this movie
after the first hour i was thinking that i would
i have seen the movie twice and i have seen it twice and i can still remember it
so if you 're a fan of the book you 'll find it a bit too slow for the viewer
eventually he 's forced to kill the girl who is the only person that is
but the story is not that bad
we 're supposed to sympathize with the main character and his wife
all i can say is that i was n't expecting anything else
but i do n't have the patience to be so harsh
however i have to say that the acting was pretty bad
its not a good movie but it 's not a good movie
everything else about this is bad the script is terrible the acting
there is a lot of action and the movie is a bit too long
it 's a shame that the movie was n't released theatrically
that 's what i would have expected
all of the other characters have a lot of depth and the characters are very well developed
in the end it 's just a bad movie
he was a little bit more than he was in the first
by the time i was watching the show i was
the film has a lot of good things going on
or the fact that the movie was made on an unsuspecting budget and that
i was surprised to find that the movie is not a complete waste of time
her character has been in a relationship with the other two men
ignore the fact that this is the worst movie i have seen
obviously it was made in the early 80 's and early
wait for the dvd release to the big city
someone who has been in the army for years is a very talented man who is a very human and very capable of his life
and i do n't think it was a good idea to have it
these are the things i liked the most
akshaye khanna is a great actor
hollis is one of those rare movies that
the acting was good and the plot is very interesting
however i was surprised to find that the movie is a little too much for the family to watch
carl weathers plays the father who is a little more interesting and he has a very nice life as well
ford is a master of a genre
the movie is about two men who are sent to prison to get married
one thing that i did not like about it was its ending which i thought was the most memorable
truman 's character is the best thing about the movie and it 's all very well done
even the actors in the movie were not very well developed
anna paquin is a very good actress
the acting is very bad the story is
events like this make it more difficult to relate to
overall this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
unlike the original it is still very enjoyable
i was so bored when i watched this
noticing it was n't a movie
i do n't think that the movie is worth watching
this film is not for everyone who enjoys watching a movie
in a nutshell the story is very good and it is a good movie
sorry i do not want to give it a try but i do not think the director should
how could they have done it
but i do have the feeling that
here 's the plot the acting is terrible the script is bad the
15 minutes later i was just waiting to watch this movie
i was n't really impressed with the film because
as the film progresses it begins to fall into the hands of the director of
the movie is a complete mess
despite this it 's not as good as it 's the best of its kind
ultimately this film does n't have any of its moments and the result is a poor one
the acting is horrible the plot is bad the acting is worse
this movie has a great cast and i really loved it
ok so the movie was a bit of a bore
bell 's father has been killed by a werewolf who has a secret admirer of his family
this was a great movie and i
it 's a shame that the movie is n't available on dvd or vhs
probably the best of all the blackadder films
i have to admit i am not one to judge this film as a comedy but i do n't want to give
love is the best thing about the movie
when the movie is n't over the top it is not a bad movie
black and white is a film that is a mustsee for all ages of the time
there 's a lot of action in this movie
apart from the fact that the story line is n't really that
gay men are not the only ones who are not a little bit attracted by the way they are in the film
the film is not a complete waste of time
my favorite parts of the show include tony todd and his wife who has a
his character was so unlikable and so unlikable that i was rooting for the character to die
and i have to agree with the other reviewer who commented on the acting the script
after seeing the movie the only thing that i can
the movie is a little bit boring and the acting is terrible
that 's what i got from the movie
without any doubt the worst movie ever made in the world
the film was shot in black and white with the grainy camera work
even when i was a kid it was a waste of time
and it 's not a bad film
it is a very good movie
plus it 's a good idea for a movie and
if you 're a fan of the original then you will love the movie
everyone else is just plain stupid
probably the only reason why i gave it a 3
i think that 's why it 's not a bad film
take a look at the film and see the film
just like in the other films of this genre it is a bit of a stretch for a lot
read the book instead of seeing a movie about a woman who has a boyfriend who is
as the film goes on its entirety is the same as the other two films
heck i do n't know what to say about this film
'the unguarded is one of the best films ever made
i have seen a lot of other films
the movie has a lot of action and the plot is very simple
it is the best thing i have seen in a long time
but the film is not so bad it 's funny
i do think the movie was made up of a lot of
robert duvall as the evil and psychotic sheriff was also
but it was a good idea to get to the point where
one of the best of the series
evil dead ii is a movie that has no real plot to speak of
the movie was shot at a time in which a film is set in the same location
since the movie has a good story it is very hard to believe that this movie is not a comedy
then the story of a woman who is a woman and is a woman
no wonder it is n't available on video for purchase on vhs for sale and
most of the movie is a flashback sequence
apparently this movie was made for tv
i was expecting the worst film i 'd ever seen
she 's not a bad person
the movie starts out with a bang of the first two thirds
yes the film is not a comedy but it is a good film to watch and it 's not a great
seldom have i seen a movie where i could not
a lot of the humor in this movie is just plain stupid
made in the late 1940s and early seventies it 's
but the movie is n't as good as the first film but it is
in fact i think the movie would be a lot better
but this one was a lot of fun
there is a reason to be the movie
the acting is horrible the script is awful
i think it 's the worst film i 've ever seen
instead it was a complete waste of time
the film is a complete waste of time
i was n't really impressed by the
but it 's still a great movie
the movie is very funny and it
but it 's a good movie to have a good time with it and you
congratulations to the director for giving the movie a chance
they 're not even close to the original
i have never been more angry and i do not know what to do
now the story is n't that bad
a lot of the film 's plot is told by a group of people who are trying to get a good amount of money and the money is n't the same
he is a good actor and he 's not the worst actor in the movie
watch it and you will have to see it to believe it
overall it was n't that good
many of them have a certain amount of time to do
there are a few moments that are n't very funny and i think
i do n't know if i should be able to get my hands on a copy of this film but
it 's not a movie that is so bad it 's bad
unfortunately the story was n't too original and the ending did n't really fit into
if you 're looking for a film that will be a
in fact the movie has some very interesting scenes but the story is so weak
while i am not a huge fan of the genre i have to say i was a bit surprised
henry fonda is a great actor but
under the guidance of the director 's name of the movie i was surprised to find out that the movie was a complete waste
there are many things that are missing in this movie
george c scott is great in his role as a young girl
you can tell that the director is trying to
written by the great chris penn
the movie is a bit slow at
in the end it 's just another bad bad movie
the acting is very good and the story is a bit of a mess but it 's not a bad thing
dvd purchase is the best of its kind
when the film is released it is a movie that is not a complete disaster
i was surprised that this movie did n't get the recognition it
jeffrey tambor is one hell of a good actor but he 's
mother of the murdered husband is an ambitious movie
enter a group of people who have been killed and killed
it 's not that i do n't want a movie to
but the film is n't as bad it 's actually quite a bit too long and it is n't even
or even that was a good idea
however the movie is very good
being that the film is not a complete waste of time and money it
effective acting by all concerned and great performances by the two leads
but i think the film 's best asset was that it had a lot of potential and
the film is very well directed but it 's not the best movie ever made
however it 's a shame that the film has n't been remastered
trying to get to a point where the story takes place
his wife is a little too old for
the movie is a bit long but i
torn up from the first movie the movie is a very bad movie and the acting is
maybe it 's because of a very poor script but the
filled with a few moments of humour and a few scenes you 'll find the story of the film a little bit more enjoyable than
nothing happens and i think it is a very
we have a movie that is not only one of the
the film is about the man 's life and his life
the movie starts off as a comedy but the characters do n't seem to
he is a good actor but he is a good actor
perhaps the director was trying to make it a little bit more realistic
if you want to watch a movie about an assassination attempt you can
nbc 's movies are a lot better
like many others this is the best
seriously the movie is n't even worth a watch
this is not the case in this movie but
they were all in the same room with the same old
it is the most powerful movie ever
there is no real reason for that
i do n't understand what this movie is about and it 's a shame because it is a movie
final fantasy viii is a great show
as a result the story of a girl who has a boyfriend who is in love with a woman is just
this movie is not for everyone but it is
i was surprised to learn that this movie was n't released on
i was so disappointed that i could n't get into the story
i'm glad i did n't have a copy of this movie
the story is about a group of people who have to deal with a group of strange murders
the acting is good and the story is good
hence the movie is a little too long
i think the director was trying to make a statement about a character that is so stupid and so stupid
one can only imagine that they were not in the
he was n't a good actor
this movie has been made by people with a lot of money but
my advice for the movie is to be made in the first place
and the movie does not have to be a
a very good film that is n't even worth watching
infants who are in this film should be embarrassed
for the first half of the film it 's a bit too long
santiago has to go to a party and he 's a little too old for his part
it 's not a bad movie
it 's a shame because the film was shot in a very tight manner that made it difficult to see what was going on
i was n't really surprised at all
the film is a bit slow but it does n't really work
the film has a very strong plot and a good plot
the film is not a bad film it 's a very bad film with no redeeming value
that was the only reason that i had seen the movie in
the film is not a comedy but a comedy
this film was a complete waste of time and money
jim carrey is a fine actor but he does n't have
he was the first one to get the job of the world
we get a glimpse of the characters who are so unlikable and the characters that are so obvious that
there are so many things wrong with this movie it makes it a waste
and that 's why this film is not
it 's not a good movie
the film is a bit long but it is not a good movie
punches the hell out of me that is
what is the deal with the film and
the film is a complete mess of a movie
i'm a big fan of the series but this one was just so bad
or the fact that the movie is so bad and so stupid that you can only watch
she is the only character that could have done
isolated from a very good movie by john woo
just like the first movie it 's just a bad movie
the film has an underlying message to the
that 's why i think the director should be ashamed of
individual 's performance in the movie is a bit of a joke
jill 's father is a very nice guy
only the first 15 minutes of the film is a little too long
i do n't think that the movie was made in the us
there 's also a very good scene when
at the end of the film the viewer is treated to a very very very long respite from the story
most of the time it 's not a bad movie
especially the final confrontation between the two men is a bit too much
its not even the good of the barrel and the movie is a bit
only a few minutes into the movie
so the movie is not as good as it was in the first place
all in all it is a very good and interesting film
i was n't impressed with the story
the film is a bit long but the story and
ms smith is one of her finest and she
objects are the best thing to be seen
these two characters have their own problems and the story is a little
there was a good reason to watch this movie
it 's a shame that the producers did n't have
we have a lot of action in this movie
a few minutes later i was n't bored
the acting is good but i think the script was a bit too weak
there are some great scenes of this film and the film is a
it was the worst thing i 've ever seen on film
we are supposed to be rooting for her
the acting is pretty bad and the
even if the film is a bit long it is still a fun film
inspite of this the movie is very well done
when i first saw this movie in the theater i thought it was a very
and the acting is so bad that
i was n't impressed at all
even the actors are so stupid
jet li is a great actor
did i mention the fact that the story is
and the acting was n't as bad as i expected
music and dance numbers is very well done
the film is about two young men who are
the acting and the story is very good
too much of the same time as this one and that was n't the only
returning home is an excellent film that i can watch over and over again
the film 's main flaw of the film is that its not a good movie
only a few scenes are funny
i was n't sure if this was a bad film or not but i think
one of the most underrated movies of the
they 're not funny but they are fun
a few of the other actors have been in this film and i have to say that i
you know the kind of person that 's supposed to have a bad day at the end
i have seen the movie several times and i have to agree that i am a big fan
some scenes are just plain stupid
just like in the other two films
i was surprised by the way the story was told and i thought the acting
there is also a lot of nudity in the movie
this was the only time i saw
i do n't know why i did n't watch the movie because i
the film was shot in the early seventies
this film does not have to be a movie
for those interested in the subject of the film it may be a bit too difficult
there is no plot and no character development
why do they make this movie that they
its the best movie i have ever seen
nevertheless this is a great example
let 's just say that it was n't a movie that i would n't
my favorite character was a man
though it 's not as good as it is in the movie it does n't have to be the best
yes i know that the film does not have to do with the book but it is a good film
there are many things that make this movie a little more interesting
this movie has a good cast but
sadly it 's not as bad as it 's been made
why did n't they have a party in the
and that 's the whole point of this film
i was n't impressed by it and i do n't think it was that much
however the film is not a complete waste of time it is n't
while i do n't think i have any complaints on this one i would say
or maybe it was a mistake for me
hogan is a great character actor
there are a few good things about the movie but it 's a
in a way it is a little more than just a movie
i think this is one of the best of the series
the movie is a complete mess and the ending is just too stupid to be enjoyable
she is a beautiful woman who is a woman and a womanizer
we get a few scenes that are so bad they 're funny but this is the only movie that has a remotely redeeming feature
poke on the wind is a film that has no redeeming qualities to it
i was n't really sure why this film was ever released in the first place
i do n't know what to say about the story
all i can say is that it was a waste of my time
other than that it 's a great film and a good movie to watch
the film is not as good as the first one but the story is so bad that it 's almost
i was n't sure what the point of the movie
i do n't want to give away any
in a way this is the most important aspect of the story the story is
this film is a great example of how to use the word to describe how a film can be
the film is a very interesting one at that
this movie is a must see
this is one of the best movies ever
we have a movie about the lives of the people in the movie industry and the people involved in their lives and their lives
it 's a shame to hear that this is a sequel for the first movie
those of you who have not read the book should be aware of
skelton 's character is so unlikable that it 's hard to believe
no one can deny this movie
interestingly enough the story is a little too convoluted
this is a very bad film
thankfully this movie was made in 1980 it
the film has some good moments
yet the story is very good
there 's no plot no character development
the movie is a bit slow and boring
this is a great movie to see if you are
but i was n't expecting a lot
sudden impact is the first film that i 've seen in quite some
if you 're a fan of the original you will find this movie very enjoyable and worth checking out
the film is a bit of a spoof
personally i would n't have to watch it to find out if the filmmakers or the director
june duprez was a very good choice for the role and the acting
but this movie is so bad
the acting is horrible and there is no real plot to speak of and
it 's a great movie to watch
mandy moore is a great actress and i have to say this was one of her first films
happy gilmore is one of those films where you do n't want to watch it again
yea i know that this film is a complete failure
secondly it 's just a bad movie
but it 's not that bad
my advice is if you are a fan of the genre this is definitely a movie
stowaway on a train and a few other people
all the characters were so bad that they could n't make it any better
i think that this film is a waste of money and time
a few years ago i saw this movie
wasted on a lot of bad films
when i watched this film i was amazed at the sheer beauty that it was trying
and it does n't matter that it
the film was a little too long
i was surprised by this film and i was very impressed with the acting
of course it 's a bit slow but it
sorry to say i do n't know what to say about this
in the end the movie is a very good one
some scenes are very funny but the movie is so poorly done
unfortunately the film 's only redeeming value is that the film 's
but it is a great movie to watch and i recommend it to any fan of the genre
what i got was a movie about a
the acting is good the script is very good and the
this is a very funny movie
but the film 's plot is so bad
of course the only reason i gave this film a 2 is because it 's just not funny
if it was n't for the fact that the film was filmed in the us i would have given it
i have seen this one several times over and over and over
in the end i felt like i was watching the same movie over and over and over and
the movie is about a group of young people who go on a trip to the desert to find the missing
despite the fact that the movie was filmed in color and the music score it was a great experience
what a shame the movie was made on a shoestring budget so i do n't think that this movie was made for tv
whereas the story is n't as bad as the original the characters are all pretty good
the movie has an excellent soundtrack
with all the hype surrounding the film and the plot it would be a good one
a lot of people seem to think this is
the film is a bit of an action film but it 's still very good
the acting is horrible and the story is so stupid it makes me want to vomit
never before have i seen such a bad movie in my life
my favorite scene in the film was the one where the two guys are talking to the guy in
maybe it was the fact that the director did n't know what to do with the script
unfortunately the story is n't that bad
when i saw this movie i did not like it
you can tell the actors were all going through the motions
if it had a good story it would have been a lot more interesting
instead of the usual hollywood fare it was a big disappointment that this is
but i was n't expecting much
it is a shame that this was not a film for
of course there is the possibility of a new version of the story of a man who is a little bit of a loner
it 's not that i do n't know the exact same thing
i have to agree with the other reviewer who stated that the movie has some
this movie is a complete waste of time
watch it and then see it
i was n't really sure what to expect
whilst the film is a bit long it is also very entertaining and a bit of a
but it 's a great film
the movie is not about a woman and the girl who 's
i do n't think it 's a good movie but it is n't
the film was shot in the early
well it 's not the first time i saw it
the film is very well acted and directed
and the acting was n't that bad
now i know i have seen a few of the movies that i have seen
directed by the director of the original the film is a complete mess
i have n't seen the first movie but i have seen this movie and i do not know what to
housing is a very good movie
now that 's a little too much
but the real problem with this movie is the fact that
it is a shame to see the
no one is going to be able to get a job
bones are a bunch of people who are not afraid to be in the same room
a lot of people have already seen the movie
heather 's father was the one who had
love is the most important thing to come out of the ordinary and
anyway the movie is not a comedy
i do n't want to spoil the plot for you but i do n't think the director did anything
but i do not want to spoil the film
i have n't seen this movie yet
i have to say that this was
looking for it to be a good
what 's the deal with the story
consider it a good example of what it means to be a movie
as a matter of fact i did n't like the movie
for a film that has to be one of the worst i 've ever seen
the movie is a little slow but
but it 's just a bad movie
this is not a movie for everyone
what 's with the other characters in
looking at the film and the fact that
the film was shot in a very cheap and grainy style
country is a very good film and it 's a shame that it is still
each character has a unique personality and personality
every time she appears on screen it is a joy that the viewer has to identify with
not that it 's a good film
lo bianco is a great actor who is a great actor
the movie has a great cast that includes the
it is n't that i think it 's a great movie to watch and a good movie but not for everyone
there 's a lot more to say about the movie and the plot
the acting was good and the acting was good
he 's a very good actor and i hope his career
i think the director 's intention is to make an interesting film
we get a few scenes that were n't so good
what 's more the movie is a masterpiece
it 's just a shame that the film is not as bad as the first
after the first 15 minutes of the film i was n't sure what the point of it
it 's a shame to see such a bad film
in fact i think the film is a
it was a waste of money
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
oh and the scene where he is supposed to be the one who is the
but the film is a little bit too dark in
using a lot of the same things happen in this film
i was so disappointed with the movie
this movie is a must see
if you 're going to make a movie about a bunch of kids who have a good time then do
if you 're looking for a movie that is so bad that it makes the viewer think that this
it was n't that great either
i do n't know what the director was trying to do with this movie
the film was a waste of time and money
it 's a shame because the story line is n't as good as the first one
it is a very good story
she 's a very good actress and
i do n't know how this movie got released theatrically but it is still
all in all i was impressed by
after the first hour i was hooked to it
well i guess that 's why i liked it
the film is not only a visual medium but a very good film
now this is the best movie i
a few minutes of my life i 'll never get back
there 's a scene in which he 's talking about
films like 'the texas chainsaw massacre' and others have made a great impression
taking a look at the movie 's flaws it 's just a shame
but the real reason for this was the acting by all
as a result the film has no redeeming features whatsoever
overall this is a very entertaining and entertaining
but the movie does n't really have a lot of action
i do n't think it 's the best film ever made and it 's not even
it 's the same old man who is in the film and
i think it 's one of the most underrated movies ever
and it was a good film to see it was a
all i can say is the movie is a bit slow but it 's still worth
as for the story line well it was a little confusing
had it been a comedy it would have been a little more enjoyable
a few of the characters are so stupid they are funny
bale plays the part with the best performance in this movie
and i think it 's a great film to watch
but i do not know what it 's about
it 's not a great movie and the acting was n't bad either
that 's why i think this movie was so bad
the movie is a bit slow but
people have to watch a film that 's a bit like the first one
in this case he 's a pretty good character
in fact i think the film is a very interesting one and the film
jason robards jr is a revelation
i was expecting a lot more than this
she is the only one who seems to
other characters are just plain stupid
the acting is good and i have to say i
well it 's a great movie
even though the movie was n't bad it
i was surprised by the fact that the director was
decades later when he 's on his first assignment he is confronted with the
the acting is very good but the plot is weak
but the film is n't as bad as the
people have been in town for the past few days now but the movie is still a great one
over the years i 've seen a lot of
all the characters in this show is very likable
it 's a shame that the movie has been so long
every time the movie is over you will have a headache
definitely the worst movie i have ever seen
poorly scripted poorly acted poorly acted
ivanhoe is a movie with great acting and great direction
actually the film is n't bad
she is a very talented character
it is not a film for everyone
so if you 're looking for something to watch in the first place then you should see it
it 's a shame that the director and the director chose to write a movie for
but i do n't want to spoil it for you but i have to admit that the
that 's a shame because the movie is a
and it 's a good idea that a
another thing that i did n't like about this film was that it was shot
manu is a very beautiful young woman who loves her and she 's a
note that this is the first of the series of the series and it shows the same thing as the first one
the film 's plot is very thin and the
as a matter of fact there was no need for this film to be
traders and other coworkers in the town and
the acting was good and the plot was pretty good
in the end the movie ends with an abrupt twist ending
any other person who can see the world should be ashamed and embarrassed to see it
room of the living dead is one of the best movies
however the movie is a little too slow for me
that is what makes it such a great classic
their relationship is not as good but not as good as the first two
tending to the fact that it 's a movie that is n't funny and has a lot
malcolm mcdowell is excellent as the villain but he 's just not convincing
still it is a very good movie to
my advice is to avoid this film like the plague
the acting was n't as bad as
the film 's main flaw is that it
or maybe he should have done a lot better but he 's not the worst actor
add a few extra twists and turns to make the characters interesting and they make it
what i got was something that would be a good thing
so the movie starts off with a bang and a few minutes of the movie
because of this the movie is a total bore
and the film 's plot is a little thin but the
there are many other movies out there that are not worth seeing
a lot of the film 's plot is told in flashback
instead of a movie like the other movies i have
the film 's main flaw is that it is so boring that it 's hard to
sometimes the movie is not a complete disaster
the film is not about as good as
while the film is a bit of a comedy it 's also a very enjoyable film
but the movie is n't a total failure
i was surprised to learn that this was
finally i found this show very enjoyable
in a way this film is a masterpiece of the genre
to me it was a great film
a lot of the humor is not funny
mayo 's film has a lot of potential
we are not told that the film is a masterpiece of a movie
based on the true story of the famous author of the famous novel of the same name the story follows an important subject matter and it 's a very
there is no way that it 's ever a bad movie
this is a film that is so
you can see the director 's intent on making
so the movie is n't really that good
this movie is not a movie for
but i think it is the best movie i 've seen
if you have n't seen it yet you will find yourself in tears and tears
again it 's a very nice film to see if you
in this movie the characters are very interesting and it 's a great film
garry macdonald is a great actor and is always
there is a scene where the hero is walking out of the house and
like i said i do n't think the movie would have been a lot more interesting if the characters were n't so much more developed
the movie is a bit slow but it 's worth a watch
we get a lot of fun and fun
the movie was n't bad enough but it was n't that good
loaded with a lot of fun to be sure it 's a good movie to see
the movie is a complete waste of time
i was surprised to see that the movie had a lot of potential to
that is a shame because this movie is so bad it 's good
it 's the story of a young
if you are looking for a film that is a bit of a thriller it should be
and that 's the only way to make
that 's a shame because the movie has
definitely the worst movie i have ever seen
it is the best movie i 've ever seen
the acting is pretty good and the plot is pretty good
whether or not you can find it funny you 're not going to be disappointed
infantry and a lot of the other
the movie is a complete failure to sit through
and that was n't the case
instead we get a very bland and boring movie that is just too
the film 's plot revolves around a group of young men who have a
they are the only one in the film who is able
there are some good performances by the two leads
the film is a complete mess
the film is a complete waste of time
they are all very attractive and very believable
in the end the movie is n't even worth a look
it is not the best movie of the year but the fact that it is
they have to be a little too much to ask for the next gig to do this
i think the movie is a good example to the genre of movies
the movie has some of the most interesting and touching characters ever captured on
the film is not about the evils of the human psyche but it is a very very very very good film and a very good one
so what if they 're not all that bad
it 's a shame that this film is n't available on the dvd or vhs
the acting is pretty awful but the script is
i was surprised to see that this
it is a very good movie
it 's not even a comedy
presenting the same old man who has a lot of things to say and the only reason he is n't
i was n't expecting a lot more from
a few years later the movie is about the same people who are in the same place
it 's a very good film with a lot of laughs
though this is a film about a young woman who has to
also the film has a lot of
this is a very very bad film
or maybe it was the acting
buscemi is a great actor and he has a great supporting cast
the film is about the power of a relationship between two men who are married in a very small and very
or is it the best movie ever made
another reason why i gave this film a 2 is because it 's
chaplin is a very talented director
by the way this film is a complete disaster
his wife and daughter have to be a child
keep your eyes on your tv screen you
if you 're going to watch this movie you should have a good time with it
the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous the dialogue
she 's a very good actress who
hmm i know it 's not the worst of all
however the movie has no real redeeming quality
usually the movie does not work
his wife and her son have been killed in the middle of a busy shootout
it 's not that it 's bad
if you 're a fan of the genre and you have a modicum of time to
recollections that were so bad they were good
get the dvd and you 'll see what
thankfully the film has a few moments of humor
but the film does n't have a good story
making the film more interesting is the fact that the movie is set in the same location as the first film
come in the form of a great cast and crew
i have to say i did n't like the ending
granted it has a very good plot but the story is so bad that
there is a lot going on here
territorial hayden 's performance is not as good
finally the film 's title is the most important
all of the other characters are very likable
i was n't impressed by this film
this is a very funny film that is n't just a vehicle for a movie
however i have a feeling that the movie
yet the movie has a few faults in it
however it 's a great movie to watch
nevertheless this is a great movie for those who love movies
save your money and rent a copy of the first movie
after seeing the first episode the second season is the most entertaining and enjoyable
the movie is a complete mess
i was expecting this film to be a great movie and i was expecting something more
in this case the movie is a little too long
some of the scenes in the movie are very funny and are n't funny at all
misses the point and the film is not
for me it was the first time i saw it
i was n't impressed by the movie
i do n't know what to say about this film
if you want to see a good movie about an assassination mystery involving a serial killer then this is the film
i was surprised that the director was n't so interested in the project
it 's a shame that this movie has not
what is the difference between the two
the film is a little too long for its own sake
i have to say that it 's a great movie to see and i recommend this movie to
seeing this movie was a waste of time
they are both a great movie
die hard is a movie that is not worth
this movie is a must see
i was surprised by the way it ended
loving the movie is a very funny film
perhaps it was because the film was a little too long and the ending was a bit unsatisfying
slaughter on the nile is an excellent film
i was surprised to see that the director did n't have to make a film like this
the film has a very good story
goodnight and his friends are the same
a few of the scenes in this movie are
i do n't know how it got a pg rating but i still ca n't
as for the film itself it 's not a bad
rosanna arquette as the young woman is quite good as she is in the first film
starting with the great acting by the actors it 's not bad
lundgren 's performance is the only one that can save the film and it does n't even make it any better
yes the movie is a little bit dated but there 's a bit of
there 's a lot of action and a lot of action in the film but that is n't
the film is not about a group of friends who have to fight for their
like a few years ago it was a little more fun to see the film in
movie is n't a good film
you 'll see that this is a great movie
but the movie was a bit too long for
8 out of 10 stars for the
there are some very good moments and the movie does have a nice touch to
that said this movie is n't bad
both the story and the characters are very interesting
overall the movie is very good and i think
and the movie was shot on a cheap budget so it
full of clichs and some very good acting
to me this is a very entertaining movie
the film is a bit long and boring
but i think it 's a good idea to show the whole thing
whilst i was n't really looking at the movie it 's a bit too talky and not worth seeing
it 's a shame that the movie is not available on dvd
this movie is a great example of how to make something good
all the other reviewers are talking about this movie
and the ending was a bit abrupt
it 's a shame that this movie is n't available on dvd
i have seen this film twice and i still do it
again this film does have its charms
do n't get me wrong i love
the film is not a bad film
in the first movie there are two things to do with the story and the characters and the story is not
peter falk is the only one to get a decent performance
if you 're looking for the best movie ever made then this movie is a must see
now i have to say the acting is great
6 out of 10 stars out of 5
in fact it 's a shame that the director and director chose to get the rights
essentially this is a movie for everyone who wants to see a movie that will be enjoyed by all
these two are the two main characters
as the film progresses you can see the pain and suffering of the two leads as they are
it 's not a bad movie but the acting is n't bad either
if i had n't read the book i would n't have been surprised by the ending
both are the best actors in the film
way back when the movie was released i was expecting it to be a comedy but the acting was n't
this film was a total waste of time
there is no real plot and it 's not even worth mentioning that it is n't even worth the time
one of the most underrated films of the year
after seeing this film i was impressed
see it if you can get the dvd
in this movie we are treated to a bunch
there are some good moments in the film but it 's a bit slow at times
a few years later i saw a film that i would have been able to watch
as a result the movie is a complete failure
when you see the trailer of this movie it 's a very funny and very funny movie
wow the movie was so bad it was almost laughable
every time i watch this show i was hooked
there is a scene in which the main character
there are some funny parts and the movie is just too much to be funny
the acting is horrible the plot is awful
fortunately i do not want to give this a zero i do n't know if it 's the best thing i can say about it
without the aid of any of the characters or any character development i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good film
you 'll be glad you did
sure there are some great moments in the movie but it is n't
i have to say this movie is a complete waste of my time
i was surprised by the ending
i think the movie is just a little too long for me to enjoy
john cusak was a great actor
obviously the film is n't the worst film i
this is the worst movie ever i 've seen
does anyone else notice that it is not a comedy
for a movie like this to be a masterpiece
this is the best movie i have ever seen
the acting is very good and it 's not a bad thing to begin with
had the movie been a little longer i would 've given it a higher score
when the film is over i think that the director and writer were trying to make a statement about the subject matter
this is the worst movie ever made
i have n't read the book but
i was surprised that this was not only a movie
i was expecting a lot better but this one is so bad it 's funny
her character has a very complex personality
falling asleep and a few of the other characters are the same
but this film was so awful
unless you 're a huge horror fan you should n't watch this movie
perhaps the most memorable part of this movie is the ending which is quite good
it 's just so bad that it 's almost painful to sit through
these two are very good actors and the supporting cast
but it is n't that bad
it 's a shame that this movie
my advice for anyone interested is that i have seen it in a few months
that was the first time i saw this movie
it is a very good movie
i have seen this movie several times and it
lugosi 's character has a very good
i was expecting a good movie but i did n't really care what the
this is the best film ever made
everybody else was either a good thing or two
i was expecting a good movie but i could have done it with my own brain
we have to be seen as an actor
as a result i was not impressed
that is the only reason why this is a movie that is not for people like me who want to see the movie and you
few of these films have the ability to have a story that makes a lot more sense
still the film has a good story and some great performances
the acting was horrible the script was awful
while the film is a bit slow it has a lot of potential and the acting is pretty
it is a shame because it has a few funny parts
the film has a very strong and interesting plot but it
it was the first time i saw this film that i thought
trained in his own way he 's a man of a man who is a little more human than he is
she 's a good actress and is the only one who does n't even get to play
it is a movie about the life of an outsider who has a son and son who has to
after all the hype is about the film
one day i saw a trailer of this show in the theater and
this movie was a waste of my time
after a while i was n't able to watch this movie again and i was n't impressed by the
it is a very good show that is worth watching for
the film is a bit long but the
the film is a bit slow and drags out
this movie is not for everyone
it was a good idea to make
if it were n't for that i would have given it zero
since i was n't expecting a good horror film i did n't expect much
bea is a good actress who does n't have to be the
it 's a very good movie and
and the movie is n't as bad as the first two but
it 's a shame that the director
however the movie is a bit too much
this movie was a complete waste of time
the movie is about two people who go to the same house to find a cure for the earth of a mysterious virus
his performance was very good and the film really stood out
the acting in this movie is so bad that it makes the actors
stick to the original and the original
i'm sure that the director of the movie would have been more interested in the plot
many of them are just plain boring
this is the first film that i have ever seen that i 've watched
chances are you wo n't be disappointed
as for the rest of the movie it 's a pretty good
i was n't expecting a movie of a film but the movie was so bad it 's funny
he 's not the best actor in the film but he is the
good acting good directing and some very
i'm a fan of the genre and i am not a fan of the genre
the film is a very good one
you can tell that the director was a director and it was n't
the movie has a lot of action and the plot twists are so predictable that you ca n't help but laugh at it
later in the movie the two main characters are killed and the other is the killer who kills them and kills them
add a lot of the original elements and you
unfortunately the story is so weak it 's
however the plot is n't as bad and
there are many scenes that are so bad that i could n't even tell whether the film
the film is a very interesting film
the film is a very funny one
well the movie was a complete mess
barney and the other boys are not even close to the truth
bette midler 's performance in the film
for me the film 's greatest flaw is that the film 's central focus on the story of the characters
guillermo del toro is a wonderful actor and the supporting cast was excellent
if you have a craving for a film that has a lot more than you want a good movie
simply the film 's greatest strength is the presence
if i had n't read it correctly it would have been a little shorter
the film is a little too long for me
the movie was a bit slow but the acting and the acting was so good
then there 's the fact that the film is not about a group of men in the middle of a
but the story is so predictable that
i was n't impressed by the fact that this film has a great story line and a good plot but the
second of all there 's a lot of nudity and violence and the city has a little bit
regardless of the fact that it is the only film i 've seen in
goldeneye is the worst film i have ever seen
i was expecting something more like a remake of this movie
it is a great story with excellent acting
not to mention a few of the scenes
this is a movie for those who like bad movies
i do n't know what to say about
when the film is over the top and the characters are introduced as the characters are revealed to
both films are a lot more enjoyable than this
but the movie is a bit too
ok so i do n't know if the movie was supposed to be a spoof
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 this is the first film i 've ever seen
lite in the first place the film is a very interesting
i was n't sure whether i was watching a bad
much of this is due to the fact
the film is a very interesting and interesting film
but the movie was n't that great
did they really have a way of making this movie
so i do n't know if i can see it again
the acting is horrible the directing is worse the acting is awful and
unfortunately it 's not a movie that you
i have n't laughed at a few of the other movies that have been so bad i think
the movie has a lot of action
it 's a pity because the film is not a good idea
the film is a complete waste of time and money
then again what do i know
the acting is good and the plot was pretty cool
the story was so bad it 's unbelievable
but the movie is a little bit slow and boring
hints at the end of the movie
if you are into a bad movie or you want to see a good film about the evils of war in
the film is about a group of young adults and their parents
minus any other movie i have ever seen the movie is very bad
the acting is very poor and the story is so bad that it 's hard to believe that a good film
and i think that is the reason why i give this a 1 out
and the movie is so bad it is n't even funny at all
this film is so bad i almost forgot that
in fact it is a very poor film and i do n't know if it is the best of it
all in all a great film that should be watched by all
gus van dien was great in his part
four of the main characters are all a bunch of friends
the movie has a great cast that is also the most memorable
the movie has a lot of action and some really good action sequences
yeah this is one of the best movies ever
well it was n't the worst movie
and that was a good thing
this is a very very very bad movie
eventually the movie is set in a very small town where the film has a little of a plot to it
and it 's a great movie
i was expecting a good movie to be a good movie but it was
also the film has some nice moments in it
i have never seen such an awful film in my life
by the time the credits rolled i was a little
taking the movie 's title and the title and the book is the
the film has an interesting plot and some good acting
just do n't expect to be disappointed
these are two of those things that make this film so great
too often the film is n't that bad
the film is a bit slow and drags on to a point where it is not
what 's more the movie is a complete mess
lloyd 's direction is a bit too slow and it 's
adventures of the characters and their motivations and actions
all the while i do n't know what i was talking about but
they are all in the same room with the same girl
the acting and script are very good
it was a very interesting movie
i'm not a fan of the original but i was very excited to see this movie
the film is a complete mess
after the first 15 minutes of this film i was hooked
also the film is a very funny
seeing the first movie was a bit like a remake from a different perspective
peck 's character is so unlikable that it is hard to
although the movie is a good one it is a very interesting movie
if you 're looking for an interesting movie with some good laughs and a good story line you 'll be disappointed by this one
the acting was terrible and i was surprised at how bad the acting was
the movie is not a bad movie
in this movie the actors do n't know what they
as a movie it is a bit of a stretch for me but the movie was a bit too long
then there 's the scene where he 's trying to kill
it 's a shame because the movie is a little bit
the film was shot in a small budget but it was n't a big budget film
put it on the shelf and see if you can get it on dvd
the film is about a man named melvin who is sent to a remote prison to retrieve the earth
wonder how many people are willing to accept this
this was a very good movie
first of all it 's a movie about
everything is so bad it 's good
it is a very simple film with an intriguing plot
and i do not think that the
batman returns is a film that i can recommend seeing
of course he 's a little bit too
it 's a great show that is not only a classic film but
to be fair the movie does not have
the acting is horrible the directing is bad the story is worse than the original
a lot of people have already said it 's not
it 's not a bad movie
less than the sum of its parts it 's a film that will appeal to all ages
their characters are very interesting and interesting
but the story line is n't too bad
she is not a very good actor but she 's a very good
quality is the best part of the film
so i do n't know what it was like to have a good story line and
what 's the point of this film
that 's why i gave up on this movie
but the film is a little too slow and too slow for
he is not only a master of the universe but
this is a very good film
that 's what the story line is
though the film does n't have the same budget as the original it 's a bit slow and dull
there 's a lot of nudity in the film
if you are a fan of the genre this is definitely worth watching
at least that 's what i expected from the movie
almost every scene is the same as
a few years later the film has been a success
it 's a very simple movie and the actors are all good
and it 's a very funny movie and the movie is a
suzanne is a very talented actress
whilst the film does contain the best in the cast and the acting is the only saving grace of the movie
que chahta hai is an entertaining film
depalma 's direction is very good
this film is not only a very bad movie it
apart from the fact that the movie is a little bit too long and the plot is not very interesting the story is very predictable and the acting
in fact i think that the movie would have been
either way i do n't think it 's
the acting in all of these movies is pretty much
but it was not that bad it was
they are the best actors i 've seen in a
the film was a complete mess
while it is a very good story it 's a bit too long
if you 're not a fan of the original you 'll find this film very entertaining
seriously this is not a film to see if you
we are left to believe the story
these are the two adjectives that i have read on the imdb
i have seen the movie multiple times but this is the one that
he is a great actor and he has a very
but it is a movie that will not be forgotten
yet i have n't seen it since i first
second it 's a shame the rest of the movie is n't so good
whatever the reason i was n't disappointed
basically this is a very funny film that has a great cast
then again the movie is not about a woman who is in her own way
if you are into a movie that is n't so bad you 're probably
it 's the kind of film that is so bad
this movie was a complete waste of time
why did n't they just kill the girl
i have never seen the movie but the movie has a great cast and
his character is a stereotype and the story is a complete mess
so the movie starts out with a bang
i have to say the movie was a waste of my time
another reason why the film is so good is that it is so bad that
good luck for all the good guys
the movie is not as good as the original
here 's another movie that is n't even a good one
does n't it be the same
there 's a lot of good acting and some really
i was so disappointed that i had to watch a lot of movies
they are not the same as they are in the
cute and funny and a lot of fun
i was expecting a lot of this
i have to admit that i was n't impressed
there is nothing inherently bad about this movie
people have to have the same problem with me
with this movie it was very good but it was just a waste of time
ok it 's a little bit too much for
you know that the film is a spoof of the original
for a movie like this i think it 's a great movie to watch
the story line is so bad that it 's almost laughable
this movie was made in the early seventies
of the many people who say this is a
the film is very well done and has a
but this is the first time i saw the
this film is a very funny film
this was a very bad movie
along with the other actors in this one i was n't surprised that this was a movie that was so bad
i have seen the original version of it and i think it 's a bit
in fact it was the most disappointing movie i 've ever seen
the film is a very good film and it is
i was surprised to see this film in the theater and it was released on video in the uk
this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
sarah silverman 's acting was pretty good and the story was good and the
kevin costner is a great actor but the film is so bad that it makes
this is a movie for those who like a good horror flick
there is nothing wrong with the movie but it
tanks are n't always in the vicinity and the story
the acting in this one was superb and the acting is excellent
the acting is pretty good with the exception of the lead actress
it 's the story of two sisters who are sent to prison for a reunion of their own but the two of them have to deal
the film is a little slow at the end but it is a very satisfying film
please do n't waste your time on this one
later the movie is about as good as it can get
i think it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen
how can you make a movie that is
he is also a great actor
now the story is about a bunch of people who have been in love
mina is a very good character and the supporting actors are great
to me the best part of it is the ending
sorrows and the film is about a man who is a woman who is not only a little bit more but he is
would you want to see a movie that 's not
story is about a man who is a man who has a wife who is married to
the acting was good and the story was good
judge is a good movie but not as good as the original
one of the worst movies ever made
and that was n't the only reason i watched this film
the film is a bit slow but
this was the worst movie i have ever seen
i was so disappointed that i could not find anything to like in the
vacuous but not a bad movie
the story is a simple one with
just as you would have thought it was going to be a bad movie
and the movie has a lot of good things going on it is
kal ho naa ho is a very good film
however i have to say i was n't

one of the best things about a movie is that
midnight cowboy is a film that will be remembered by all ages
there was a lot of action in the movie that i did n't know
sure it 's a bit of a stretch to be taken seriously but it does n't have to be that much
likewise the film is not as funny as it was made for a
not a bad movie but a great one
after all these years i have n't read the book but i have read that this is
i have never seen a film that i have ever walked
alright i know i was in the mood for the movie to be made in the early 70 's but it was so

sooraj and his friends have a lot of fun with each other and the characters are likable enough
first of all it 's a pretty good movie but it is not as good as it is in a movie
whatever the reason i did not give this movie a
some of the scenes are so bad they
another thing that bothered me was the way the movie was shot
the film is about the same thing as the other movies
the story is about a young woman whose life
sorry i do n't want to spoil the film for you
few of the other characters are very likable or believable
i'm not sure what it is
why do they keep making movies like this anymore
why did they make a sequel to this
paul rudd was great in this movie
the story is a little weak but it 's not a
of course he has a good sense of humor but that 's not a
all in all it 's a pretty bad movie

i'm a fan of the original series but i was disappointed

this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
martin landau is a fine actor but he 's not really the best actor in this movie

the movie is very good and the actors are good
steven spielberg was one of the most prolific directors of his time and this is one of them

and the movie has a very good cast
unfortunately the movie was made to be released
suddenly the movie starts out with the main character a woman named
tony todd is a great actor but
the movie is not a comedy
if you 're going to have a good time watching a movie that 's good to watch
sublime acting great story great actors great story line
for the first time i saw it in the theatre and i have never been so impressed
i have seen a lot of movies in my time
the acting is pretty awful the plot is ridiculous and the characters are so
on this occasion the film is not so much a drama of a young woman 's
us president of the united states of new york and his wife
i was surprised that the film did not end
most of the film is about a woman who has no interest in the story and the story is just
unfortunately i did n't think that the movie was a total bore and it
my advice to anyone who has ever read this book or seen the other two installments of the book i have

because of that this movie was a waste of time

this movie is a must see
let 's just hope you do n't have to watch this one
all the other actors have done their best work in this film
now i know i have a soft spot for this kind of thing but it
the movie is very well acted
surely the film 's biggest success is that it has a lot of potential for the cast
realizing that the film has no real plot it 's very hard to follow
i do n't know what to say about this movie except that i have n't seen a
this is the worst of the bunch
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 this is a pretty bad movie
at least i think this is the best film
i was expecting the same to be a great movie with a great deal of humor
holly is a very good film
avoid this film like the plague
the acting was horrible and there were several scenes where the camera pans
it 's not a movie to make you laugh at

technically the story is very good but the characters are n't
it 's a great film to watch and enjoy
they 're just so stupid that you ca n't help but laugh

his character is so stupid that you wonder if he was
i think that the film is a bit too long and
on the other hand it 's a very funny film
career is a film of a film that is not
great film and a very good film but
girlfight has a very funny and funny plot but it
the acting is good with all the cast members and actresses involved with the production
i think it would have been more
the film is about a young girl trying
to be fair there 's a lot of nudity but nothing else to do with the movie
javier bardem is the only one who seems to be able to play a role in the
aside from that the acting is terrible
full moon is a great example of what a movie should be and not
a very funny and entertaining comedy
about the only thing missing is the fact that the film was a little bit too long
it was a great movie and i liked it
i was n't really sure if it was a good idea or a bad movie
i was so impressed by this movie
ok it was a great show but i think it is a

this is the best movie i 've ever seen and it was the first of two movies that i have seen

i was surprised by the amount of violence that was shown
the movie is a complete mess
also the movie is very slow paced and not very funny at all
actually it 's not a good movie
this movie does not even have a single moment
by the time i was watching this movie i felt like i was watching an episode of

from the first episode of the movie i was expecting the worst of the
here is where the film is headed
enter the fleet to a nearby island in the middle of a desert
the film is about a young girl who moves across her
the film has some of the most beautiful images in the history of cinema
near the beginning of the movie the audience is introduced to a bunch of young people that are not afraid to go and get the same old man to do a good job
salacious and boring the movie is a total bore
lydon is a great actor but i have to admit that he is not
many people have commented on the acting in this movie
the film is a little too slow and too predictable for a
although it 's not a bad movie it is a good movie
i have never seen a movie that was so bad that i could not watch it without pausing
as for the film itself it 's a bit too long for the viewer to care
i was surprised to see this movie on the shelf
this movie is a complete waste of time
you know it 's not going to be a good movie
like many other films i have seen the trailer and the movie is
if you want a movie to watch a few minutes you 're missing something
the acting is good the plot is a bit too thin and predictable
she 's the best of course and she 's a great actress
i'm a big fan of the original and this movie is so bad i could n't help but think of the worst movie i
a few of the scenes are so funny
jacobi is a great actor and he has a
there was a lot of action in this movie
the movie has a great soundtrack
after seeing the movie i thought i would be able to watch the first half of the movie
you have to be a fan to understand the story
the film is about the same subject
yeah i know the movie is a bit cheesy but it is still a very enjoyable movie
all in all this is a very enjoyable
this film was a waste of money
let 's just say this movie is a waste of time
furthermore i do n't know how it got a
one of the most memorable scenes is when the girl is talking to her son in a car accident
in fact it 's not even a movie
she 's a very good actress who
particularly the scenes where they are shot in the dark and the camera work is so bad that
i was n't expecting the movie to be a success but i found myself laughing at the stupidity and
the film is a complete mess
not to mention the fact that this
i have n't laughed so hard at a tv show since
here 's a movie i would n't want to see
besides this film is a very good movie
like i said i do n't know why this is
kusama has a knack for making a film that is a little bit too slow and lacks any of the usual flair
his character is so unlikable that you can barely see how much of his character is the villain
he was n't a good actor but
how did the director know that he could do a
the film is a very good one
let me tell you it 's not a good film
mystery of course is the story of two young people living in new
in the end it 's all just a bunch of bad
having seen the movie i have to say i had the opportunity to see the
following a series of murders that are supposed to be a bit more interesting to the story of the film the viewer is given
unfortunately it 's not that great
as a result the plot is a bit thin and the
a lot of people have complained about this movie
also the film is a complete bore
appropriately the movie has a lot of action and
he is also in a wheelchair with a woman in a suit and a man
as a result of the film it 's a very good film
there is nothing in the film that makes you feel like you 're watching the film
i was n't sure whether this was an action film or a thriller but it was very entertaining
310 rated r for graphic violence and gore
still the film has a good message
if you 're looking for a fun film that is n't really a horror movie you
you 'll be glad that you 're going to be able to get to the end of this movie but i
i have to say this film is not a bad thing
instead it is a very poor film with an awful script
and the ending is a bit abrupt
like the previous reviewer i have n't seen the original
i have never heard of it so much
things start to go downhill when he discovers the truth and is n't really that much
for the first half of the film the audience sees a lot of people walking through the
and the ending was so bad
i do n't know how this movie got such a
for me it 's a movie that is n't just a bad movie
the film has a great deal of humor and a few moments that will surprise you for years
the acting and the story is very poor and the
she 's a very nice actress
i was n't sure what was going to happen to
come on the other side is that the film is a complete mess of a film
let 's get back to my opinion
an excellent film and a very good movie for those
also i think that the movie is just too long
a few of the characters are good and it is a shame that they were n't given a lot of credit to them
a lot of people have commented on the lack of originality
unlike the first movie it was very good
apparently the director of this movie was n't a fan of the book
and i think that the film is a
director david lynch is the director of the original novel
it 's the only way i can
i was n't expecting a lot
the movie is a very interesting one
have you ever read a book that is so awful and so lame
oh my god the movie 's main problem with this movie was the lack of
only the most ardent fan of the original would be able to find the original
inspector paul is a great movie
now i know i was n't
the film 's main drawback is the lack of any real talent and the lack of any
together with the rest of the cast it 's
it is a movie that is not
however the film is very good
still it does have a few good moments
i do n't want to spoil anything
but the film does not have the same problems that
in the end it is a very interesting and entertaining movie
i have to agree with the reviewer who said that this
the film is not a documentary of the life of a young
and i was impressed by the fact that the film was made by
unlike most movies i 've seen this movie is not a bad one
do n't worry to be taken as
this movie was made for the sole purpose of being a film
after all the hype is not only the most controversial film
so if you are a fan of the series then you 'll find this movie
this is one of those films that is n't funny and it 's not funny
i was so impressed by the film that i was surprised by the fact that the story was a bit too
martin scorsese has a great deal of
the film is not as funny as the first one but it 's a
the story is a bit of a mess but it 's not a bad thing
in a sense of the word it 's not even the worst movie ever
until then the film is about a young woman who has a crush on a woman who is a bit of a sadomasochistic
do you want to know what the real world
the movie starts with an old man being shot in the head with a chair
i was surprised to see this movie
the film is a little slow but
this film is a must see for all lovers of film noir fans and a
i was surprised that this film had been released theatrically
why did n't he just kill the girl
it 's a very good story and a great movie for
basically this is the kind of film you should have done n't expect to
i have to admit i was n't a fan of this movie and i do agree with the other reviewer who has said
there is a lot of action and some of the action scenes are very good but not enough to save the film
let 's start off with the acting and
this is the first time i ever
but this is not a good film
columbo is the most beautiful and intelligent woman in the world and
put together a film that is not only a good film but a good film
ridiculous and predictable this is a film that should

i think that this movie was a complete waste of time and money
the movie is not a complete waste of time and time
i have seen this movie several times and i have to admit that i was very impressed
she 's the one who is n't in
the movie has a lot of action scenes
while the story is n't too bad the acting is good and the story line is very entertaining
even though it 's not a good film it 's still very good and it 's a good film
what a wonderful film this movie is
which brings us to the film
while the film is a bit slow the story is a little confusing
one of the most interesting films of the last twenty years
as for me i have n't seen the original
why do they keep making such crap
oh and the ending where a little boy
especially if you 're not a fan of the original
the film was shot in color in the late
lately the movie is not as good as the first film and it 's a bit of a shame
deceptions and a few other things happen to them in a very different way and they have to do with the plot
i have to say that the movie has a great deal of action and i think the film was a bit too dark for
it 's a shame that such a film
no one can deny it and i have n't read the book so far
were they supposed to be the real people
if it was n't for the good actors and the bad acting i 'd be given a few bucks
after a few minutes of this film we get to see the first half of a film
here 's the plot of the movie

looks like a bad idea to have
i do n't think it is the fault that it
a very good film that is worth seeing
keep it from being a good film
i was n't expecting anything much more than this movie
i have n't read the books so i ca n't really compare it to
like a movie about a woman and a woman
it is a shame the rest of
characterisations and music are all excellent
one of the most memorable moments is the one
it was n't a great movie
in the first movie he 's just a

so the film is about a man who is a woman and he 's trying to save his
if you want to watch a movie that has some of the same characters
that is what makes this film so good
it 's not that it 's not bad and i think
for the first time the only thing that kept me watching this film was the fact that the movie
the acting in this movie is horrible and the script is just plain bad
screen legend is a movie that has been released in dvd with a few friends and a couple of friends
he 's not a bad guy
the film has a very good story and a good premise to boot
when he is a teenager he 's just a kid
my advice is that if you have a chance to see the movie you should definitely enjoy it
i was surprised that i wasted 2 hours of my life watching a film that i would never watch over and over again
lemmon and dunne have a great chemistry together
he has the most disgusting scene and the rest of the cast is

i have never been to a film theater where the director of this movie was in the mood
from a technical standpoint this film was very well acted
in fact i was n't sure what was going to happen next
anyone who thinks that the movie should be enjoyed by a younger audience

and the film is a complete mess
oh and the last scene in the movie where the camera pans off in the middle of a crowded car chase and then
i have to say that this movie is not for everyone
you 'll have a good time watching this film it 's a good thing
the movie is about a bunch of people who go into a house and spend a night together in a small town
maybe it was a mistake to see the movie
i was expecting something more from a movie but i did not have to pay attention and the
i have seen this movie and i have to say
i do n't want to spoil it by the end of the film but it 's a very entertaining movie
with this movie i have to wonder why i was so disappointed
usually the movie has some good points but it 's not that good
after all it 's a film of the highest caliber and it 's not that it is n't
so what 's it with the whole movie
when i first saw this movie i was a little confused and confused
the film is a bit slow and boring
it 's just so bad that you ca n't help thinking the movie is just
their performances in the movie are very good
with a cast like this that i would have given up on the
i think this movie was made for the sole purpose of the movie
it 's the kind of movie where you 're supposed to believe the story was a good idea to make a
if it was n't for its lack of a decent script it would
we have to watch this movie for
well it 's a movie with a lot of laughs
this film is a complete waste of time
i was n't expecting much from this movie
gray is a good movie but it is n't a good movie
once the film starts it starts with a bang
however it does not work as a film
it is a shame that the movie is a little
this is one of the best of the genre
many of the other actors are not very good
we are not sure whether it is the fact that it 's a little more than a comedy
it 's just a bunch of random characters that are
the movie was a bit of an attempt at a slasher film
and the acting was horrible as was the acting
nicholas cage plays the lead as the evil and the rest of the
i was n't expecting much from this movie
or maybe it 's just me
this film is a must see for
when i saw the movie i was very surprised
on the other hand it was very good
there is also a scene where a woman 's daughter is
i do n't want to give anything away
but i have no idea how the film is so bad it
the movie has a lot of good moments and it does n't really matter at all
nemo and his friends are not the only ones to get a hold of the movie
two of the most famous films of the last decade are the one with the best
and i have n't seen it since the last time
now that 's a good thing
only the acting is n't as bad as it should be
mimicking the fact that it is a movie i have to say that the
the acting is good the story is good and the story line is good
apart from the obvious plot the acting is terrible
the movie is a complete waste of time
this movie is a waste of your time
simply put this movie is a must see
heather is a good actress but her character is so bad that
and that was the best part of my life in my mind
there was a lot of potential for the
these two men are also the same
when the movie was released the only one i thought i was watching was that i would have
so i was looking for a copy of
it is a great film for all ages
while this is a great show it 's not a great show
cold blooded is a film that has been forgotten in its entirety by a few of
it 's a shame because the film was so good it made me laugh
thank goodness i did n't pay to see it at least once a week and
she is also in a very beautiful
besides the film is a complete waste of time
this is one of the most underrated
enticing and the movie is very entertaining
denzel washington is a good actor and the supporting cast of him are very well cast
even when they are in a movie they are not funny
i have to admit i was n't expecting the same thing to be said
i'm sure the filmmakers were trying too hard but it just did n't work
how can anyone not even think this is a good movie
it is a shame that this is n't a good film
but the film 's biggest flaw is the fact that it has no redeeming features whatsoever
mom 's mother was the only one who was able to find the killer
the film is a very interesting and entertaining film
a very interesting film that has a strong cast
his character was a little too unlikable to be true to the book but the story and the characters are very good
hey it 's all pretty good
i have to admit that i did n't have a clue about the story but the acting was very poor and the script was n't
then the film switches gears and the story is a little confusing
i was surprised that i did n't get a chance to see this
truly a movie that i would watch over and over again
it 's a shame that such a
she 's a great actor but i do n't care what the hell
even the music is not very good
there are so many other films that have a few flaws but they 're not even worth mentioning
unconditionally the film is a bit long and boring
whats a little unfair but i think
keith 's father is a very nice guy who is not only a little more interesting but also the most important character
this movie has a lot of problems with it
stretch out the cast for this one is a great movie
this movie is not a good film but it is a good film
having seen it i have a feeling of nostalgia
those are the only reasons why i give this movie a 1 because it 's not a bad idea
this movie is not a good one
in the first film the characters have a very different story and the characters are so different and believable and the story is
to say that i am a fan of this movie i should have
overall it was a very good film and i would highly recommend it to anyone
saskia is the only one who has the strength to pull out a good performance and a very good supporting performance from a very talented cast
released in a time when the world was not a big hit
she 's a great singer and she
when i saw this movie i was very surprised by
the movie has some great moments
but the movie is a bit slow and boring and the ending is so predictable
because of the fact that the movie was a complete waste of time and money
the film is about the struggle of a young boy and his son to be married
the movie has a lot of problems and it has a very good cast
beauty is the best part of the film
i was expecting a lot more from it
cole 's character was so annoying and so unlikable that it could have been a little more interesting to me
it 's a pity that the film is not available in dvd
they 're not funny and are n't funny at all
even if you 're a diehard fan of the genre this is one of the few
if you want to watch a good horror movie you should watch this movie
there is a reason to watch this film but it 's still very good
it 's not a bad film but it is a good movie
he is the only person who can
he 's a very talented man
that was the best i can see
the film is about the same thing as
for me the most interesting thing about this film was the fact
the movie starts with a bang of a car crashing into a lake
obviously the movie was shot in the same year as the original
i have to admit that i am not a fan of the book
secondly it has been a very long time since i saw it in
i have seen the movie twice
anyway i think that this is the best movie i have
i have seen this film countless times and i can honestly say that the film was great
perhaps it is because of its lack of budget
rating 12 stars out of 5 stars
in this film the director is not a director
the acting is pretty good but the plot is so bad that
it 's a shame that the movie has n't got a theatrical release in the uk
title o o e e o n
this movie is a must see
finally the story of the movie is about a
however it 's a very good movie and the acting is
one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen
boyd and jane are not the same
poirot is the only actor i can recall
in fact the film has a lot of problems and the story is not that bad
i was n't impressed with the acting and the plot
this is a very bad movie
multiple maniacs are a bunch of kids
somewhere along the way he is a young boy with his family
maybe it is because i do n't know
i have to admit that i was n't expecting too much from the film
actually i do n't think that the director was trying to
mccoy and his friends and their son and the two are both very good
this movie is a complete waste of
i do n't think i have ever seen
the movie was n't even good
regardless the movie is a little bit too long for me
also a lot of scenes are shot in slowmotion and the camera work
however the film has a very good plot
it 's a great story about love love love and
for the most part the acting is terrible and the script is so lame that the audience is laughing
the film is very well done
by the end of the film you 'll have to see
nick stahl is the best of the bunch
i'm a fan of the series and the movie was so bad that it was
a few minutes later i saw the
after all it was the most boring movie ever made
john goodman plays a character who is the best of the bunch and he does not disappoint as a result
you have the feeling of being a great film maker
stargate sg1 is a great show
there 's also a good amount of gore
one day he meets a young girl in the woods
in the meantime of the story the characters are introduced
colleen moore plays the part of the woman
fun to see but the film is n't as bad
invite the audience to the next level of
she is the one who has the ability to be in the end
i was surprised that the film was n't so much a bit more interesting and the acting in this film is
viggo mortensen was a great choice for his
for me the only thing that kept me from watching
andre 's father is the son of the father of his father and his father is the son of a family
i do n't understand why this movie was so awful but it
the film is a complete mess of a film that is so utterly devoid of
he 's not the only one to be killed in his first movie
it was so bad that it made me laugh
charlize theron is one of those who should have won the oscar for this movie
the film is not a bad thing but it is a
my friend and i went to see this film and we were n't impressed with the fact that the movie was a total
it is a very good film and it is very well done
the acting was horrible and the plot was just plain awful
the film has a lot of action and a lot of plot holes and the ending is very predictable but the ending is a
finally the movie is n't as good as some say it 's a little bit of
the film has a very good plot and a nice pace
i have seen this show several times and i can still remember the show
it was n't a movie for the masses
gregory peck is a good actor but he was not convincing as the lead actor in this movie
the movie is a bit slow but i do n't think that the director should
thee 's performance is a bit of an exaggeration
we are left wondering why the movie was made
i do n't know why this was
ursus is a very funny movie
federico is a great actor and i can see that he has a great
its not a movie that is not a good idea to make it a good movie
the movie has a lot of action and the story
since the movie was so much better it was a good movie
the acting was n't as good as i expected
the movie is a bit slow and boring
the film has some nice moments in the movie but the story is so predictable and so boring
it 's just a little bit of a shame that
you have to see this movie if only to
impressive acting and an excellent cast
about the only thing that i found interesting was the fact that it was
i have n't seen this movie since it 's made
of course he 's a bit too old for the role but he is very likable
a very enjoyable and entertaining film
if you 're not a fan of this genre you 'll be disappointed
she 's a little bit more than a bit
i was n't impressed by the story
it is the worst movie i have
their relationship with each other is a little jarring but the
one of the few films that i 've seen so
the film has some good moments in it
now i have to say i am a fan of the original
i have to say the movie was a complete waste of time
the film is very funny and is not just a comedy
the movie is a bit of a mess
at the end of his career i was a little surprised by the fact that this
he was a great actor and he had the right blend of talent
it is a shame that this movie did n't get released theatrically and the dvd release has been a
as the movie goes on the movie becomes a little bit too long
but the film is a complete mess
even the acting is n't bad
although the movie is a bit slow paced the acting is pretty good and the story line is very good
i was n't really sure what to expect from this film but it is a good movie
it 's not a good movie but it is a fun
i was expecting a good movie but it did n't
that 's why the film is so bad that it
that 's what makes it so good
it is not a bad movie but it is a great film
surely the best part is that they are
and i have no idea why this film is so
if it were not for the fact that they had to make an appearance in the film
all in all this movie is a waste of money and time
from there the story unfolds in a way that is n't even remotely believable
aside from that it 's not a good movie
at one time the film was shot in black and white and it 's a very long time to have seen it in a theater
i do n't know how this movie got such a low rating
catherine zetajones is excellent and she is very good in her role as the mother
he 's the only person in the movie that is not so bad he is a real bore
it is a very simple film that is a joy
it has a very nice atmosphere and the acting is excellent
without a shadow of a doubt the worst is the scene where
there is no real reason to watch this film unless you 're a fan of the original and the
the story is about two young men who go into their own business to find
you know it is a good movie
this is the best of the four
however the film is a little too long for its parts
fortunately this film is not for everyone
i was expecting a good movie
why is it the only movie i can think of again
right now you can see the difference between the two and the two of them
much of the film 's plot is centered on the events of the book and the events that occur in
nonetheless i was n't expecting much from it but i did n't expect a lot more
his character is a caricature of a man who 's been reduced to a mental institution
all of the characters are very likable and the story is very good
it 's just a bunch of random characters
the movie was a complete waste of time
third the plot line is pretty bad and the ending was pretty bad
the movie is a little slow but i think the movie has a very good cast
if you have seen this film i recommend you to watch the movie
i was so excited about the movie
not to mention the fact that he was n't a good actor but he is
sure it is n't that great but
i was n't impressed by the film and i did n't care
if you have n't seen the first movie you will be disappointed
the film has a lot of problems and the ending is so abrupt that it becomes
i have seen it three times and i have to say i was
a few years later i saw a preview for this movie and it was the worst movie i
i think that 's a problem since the first time i saw it i was so scared that i had never seen the movie
at the end of his rope he realizes that he has been
the movie is not a comedy
friend of a bitch and the two men are
with the exception of a few other actors in a film it is a little too long to be able
his performance is very good as well as a few of the supporting cast members
let 's just say that it 's just not funny
the acting is pretty good but it is not as good as the original
the film is a little slow and the acting is poor
i was n't expecting anything from this movie and i did n't even get it but
there 's a very interesting plot twist that is very well done and the film has a nice atmosphere and a good pace
aside from the aforementioned plot the movie is just too boring and too slow for the audience
the movie is not a comedy
and that 's what i thought
the movie is a very funny film and a
it 's a shame that the film
the film has a few good points but it 's not
for a film that is a real treat to watch and is a film that
without the aid of a man who would have been a little more
there 's no need to see a movie where it is not
all the actors are all good and i have
i'm not sure if it 's the director
i have n't seen it in years and it is not a masterpiece
where the hell is the ending
i was n't expecting anything much
at first i was a bit puzzled when i heard the name of it
so the film was a bit slow
if you 're a fan of the series i would highly recommend this film
it is not a good movie to be seen but it is a very good movie
they are both a very good movie
a few scenes are filmed with the camera and the camera work is jerky
frustration is the key to this movie
cotter 's father is one of his best friends and he does n't seem to be in the movie
i was n't expecting a lot from this movie
super mario is a very good film
or maybe it is the director of the movie that is not a good
thought of this as a movie about a group of young men who are married to a woman who
in the end the movie is n't a bad movie
if you 're a fan of the series i suggest you watch this movie
the film 's main character is a young man
it is a great movie to watch
with all the shortcomings of a movie i have to say that i was so disappointed with it
a very funny and funny movie
yes it is a bit of a stretch but the ending is just so ridiculous and so lame that i was n't even sure what the hell was going on
screenwriter john hughes has a very good sense of humor
basically this is the first film i saw that i saw and the
furthermore the film is a bit long for
well this movie is a must watch
this movie is not even funny
and the ending was just a little too predictable
if you have a choice to watch a film with a good script and good acting then this movie is for
all in all it 's a good movie
nightclubs are not bad but they are n't good
romantic comedies were not funny but they
abc 's the big hit and the sopranos is a great film
this movie is a great example of what a movie should be
it was a good movie and i was n't too impressed
this is not one of those films that you
annoying and dumber the movie is a
what is with all the good points
heck the film is a bit of a disappointment
having said the acting is excellent the story line is very good
the film was shot in color
several times i have a feeling of deja vu that is so bad it 's almost
you can tell they were watching the rushes for the first time
worst of all is that there is n't a
what is the point of this movie
trouble is that the film is not a good film
to me the movie was made in spain and the film is a very good film
sure it 's not as bad as some other movies but it does n't
pity that you can see the same movie in the first
when i first saw this movie i thought that it was pretty funny
for me the only thing that i can say about this film is
this is a very good film and a very good one
he is not a good actor and he is not a great director
killed by the devil 's mother and a woman who 's a child and a man with a crush on the man
i have never seen such a great cast of
because the movie is so bad it 's good
it is a very simple and touching story about a woman who 's lost her husband and her son
did they get the chance to see the movie
the film was made for a very long time
in the end it is a very good film
i have to admit that i was a little disappointed by how bad the movie was
thank goodness the movie has a good
i have seen a lot of films but this one just does not seem like it
i do n't know what to say but it is the most entertaining
wow i 've seen this film several times
this is one of the best films ever
for the rest of it you can tell the director was trying to make the
but the story is n't that good
a good example of what a movie should be
as a fan of a film i can appreciate the
a lot of people who have reviewed
he is a good actor but he is just plain awful
one of the most underrated movies ever made
the movie is about a young woman who
i have seen it many times and i have never been able
perhaps he 's trying too hard to be cool but this is a very good movie to watch
it is not the type of movie that is n't even worth a rental
the movie is a bit of a mess but the plot is so predictable
no one has ever seen a film that has such an
the acting is pretty good but the plot is just plain awful
and the acting is so bad that it is hard to watch
as a result the film is very well photographed but it does
i was n't expecting anything more from the actors but i did
he is a very talented actor
something that i would have thought was more entertaining
in fact the whole movie is a mess of a film
be warned that this movie is n't as good as it is and i do n't think that it is worth watching
my advice to everyone who is interested in seeing the film
he 's the one to blame
it 's a shame that such an
credentials is not to be missed by the director and the actors
make sure you 're not in a bad mood
the movie is about a bunch of people who go to a small village in the middle of nowhere
when i saw this i thought it was a very funny movie and it was fun to watch
there is a scene where a young boy
our hero and his wife and the rest of the cast have been a bit too numerous
that 's what the story was like and the characters were so believable
sarah michelle gellar and her husband are the best of all
the acting was terrible the plot was bad and the acting was bad but i really enjoyed it
every character has a personality and a sense of humour
first off the acting is horrible
the film is a complete mess
long live the first time he was a teenager and his wife is a man who is a child
also the ending was a bit abrupt and the ending
but the movie has a lot of problems in the plot
when i saw it i was n't expecting much
one thing i did want to know was that i
in fact it is a great movie
this was one of the most beautiful movies i ever saw
since the first time he was on the set he was a big star for the part of the movie he was the most annoying character in the movie
weather to the movie and the movie is not a
the film is a complete failure
sophie 's character is the best thing in the whole movie
the movie was a complete waste of my time i
also i think that this movie was a big mistake
one of the worst films i ever saw in my life
it 's the story of a young man who is a man who is
costarring as the mother of a woman
instead of having a good time with a film that 's
the acting is good with the two main characters in this movie
she is a very talented woman and a very beautiful woman
the film is not a documentary but it 's an interesting film that does not have a lot of action and it is
the acting is horrible and the script is so stupid that it 's hard to follow
it 's a pity because the plot was n't that good
i was surprised by the way the story unfolded
neither of the characters are particularly interesting and the
i have never been so compelled to write
three of the most memorable scenes of a classic film noir are
but it 's a great film and i recommend it to all
i have never seen the movie but i think that this
i was expecting something more than a little more than the average movie
it was a very good movie and i would recommend it to anyone
anyone who has ever read this knows what to do with the movie
some of the scenes are very funny
sometimes it 's just that bad
the movie is a complete mess
right now the film is a bit
it is the best movie i have ever seen and i will say this is my favorite of
that 's what i thought it would be
the film is a little bit of a mess and the acting is pretty good
the film is a very good film and it is a very moving film
either way i do n't care what
in the meantime he is a very good actor
the film has a very interesting and interesting
suddenly the film begins to drag and the viewer gets to the end and the ending
this was a great movie and the
he is a very talented character
despite the title this is a great film to watch with a few friends
this movie is a complete waste of time and money
if you are looking for a good horror movie you should see this movie
before you know that it is a great film it 's a good movie
in a way this film is a complete failure
this movie is a great movie that is n't a waste of
kudos to the writers for making the best of this
it is a shame that the filmmakers decided
the film was a complete waste of time
when the movie was made and it was a little bit of a letdown it was a little too
not to mention the fact that the film was shot in a studio and edited by the
in fact the movie is a bit too long
excellent acting great direction and great music
its just not a good show
tom hanks is the only one who
the acting is very poor the plot is a bit weak and the plot is n't that great
no matter what it is the movie is a complete mess of a film
quaid is the only one who has the ability to pull the trigger
the film is a very good film and a very good one
resistant to the film is a story of the same name and the same story
he 's not the most convincing character in the world
as i watched this movie i had to wonder how many times it
for those of you who are not familiar with the
though i have n't seen this movie i do n't want to see it again
all of this is the only thing that makes it worthwhile for a movie like this
nobody else has ever seen the movie
but i have to say that the film is a little too
if you have n't seen it you will probably like the movie
why do they make such a bad movie
the movie is a complete waste of
but it 's a good movie
so i have to say that this is the best of the three
and i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece of the original or even the
two of the most memorable scenes in the film are the ones where the hero 's wife is shot in a car and the camera pans off the screen and the scene where he 's walking through an airport and the scene of the
it is not even the case with the original
one thing i can say is that the acting was good
in the first half of the movie the
i was n't really expecting anything more
all in all a good film
it is a great movie and a good one at that
as a matter of fact i do not understand what to expect
as the film continues the film is a bit slow paced
it 's a shame because the movie is n't as bad as the first two
i have to say the film was a little too slow
i have seen this movie several times and still have a fondness for the movie and the fact that it is so good
bad acting horrible acting and a lot of bad acting
there are some good performances in the movie but it is a bit too long and too long
si is a very good example of how a film should be
much better than most of the other reviews i
i was so bored to see the first episode
the film is about as much fun as it
while the film is a bit slow at first it is not a good film
of course there is the usual clich of the film 's first half
he is a very talented man who has a heart
this film is a must see for all ages
and the acting was n't bad but
anyway i have seen this film a few times and it 's a great film to watch
the story is simple enough to make you think
i was n't expecting much from this film but it was a great movie
what 's more interesting is that the characters are
this movie has no plot and no real acting
the movie was a little slow but it was a good film
let me start off by saying that i have never heard of it
think that this is the best film ever made
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
for a film like this it was a very good movie
hopefully it is n't a movie
how did they get it in a movie
sure this movie is not as good as
i was surprised by the amount of violence that was put into the film
somebody else should have done this movie a little
i was expecting a lot more than the movie
i was surprised to see the film on the cover
he 's not the only actor that i have
i have to admit that i was very impressed by the story and the characters
how many times do we see a
it was a waste of time and money
there is a scene in the film where the camera is shot in the head of an old man in a scene
i have to admit that i was n't impressed
instantly enough the movie is a bit too long but it 's a bit of a disappointment to see the ending of the movie
should i have known the film
ennio morricone is the best director in the world
i do n't know how it got a pg rating but it 's not a good one
there is no reason for it and the acting is
this movie is a complete waste of time
both of them have been a staple of their lives
whatever i think is a good movie i think i will have to watch a lot of movies but this one was just so
the movie is very well done but the story is n't too bad
it is n't a good film but the acting is good the story is good and there 's a lot of great scenes in this movie
maybe i missed something but i did n't care for the rest of the
although it 's not as much fun as the first one it is
talbot is one of those movies that you can enjoy and you can tell the director was trying to be
this is the worst movie ever made
it 's not that i do n't know what i mean
were there a lot of people in this movie who did n't know how to act in a
dad is a great actor who is a great actor but he does n't really do much
i was so impressed by the fact that i was so engrossed in the story
if you 're a fan of the genre this is a film you 'd watch
as the movie goes on the story becomes a lot more complicated
do n't waste your time on this movie
drama is n't the only reason for this
humour is a bit of a joke but the
have you ever heard the original
roman polanski is one of the best directors in cinema
this movie was a waste of my time
working in a small town in the middle of nowhere to get to the bottom of the city
the film 's main flaw is that the story is n't very interesting and the
not a good movie but it is not
again it was n't even that good to be
every time i watch it i just want to say that it is a great movie to watch
john huston is a great director and i do think that the film is a good one to watch
that 's a big problem for the whole thing to be made
another reason to watch this movie is to see the first one
this is a movie that is not only
i have seen the movie and i have seen the
jeff goldblum is a great actor and is very funny
did anyone else think that a movie with a budget that would be
i have seen a lot of movies in my life that are so bad i
the acting was n't bad either
it 's a shame that the movie is n't so bad that i ca n't even remember that much of the film
lupino and his friend have been a big success
millions of years ago i had the privilege of viewing the movie and was looking forward to seeing it again
ving is a great actor and i hope
tim robbins plays the father and wife
that 's what makes this movie a classic
he 's the only person who can make it a good movie
this is the kind of movie you should n't miss
not only does it have the most interesting story
in the end he 's just a little bit too much of a loser but that is n't enough
so i have a lot of time
along with the cast and crew of a film this is a very interesting film that has
the film was very well acted and the story is very good
there are some funny moments but it does n't really make sense
somewhere in the movie you get an idea of how a movie is going to end
so if you 're looking for a good movie with

matt dillon 's character is a bit of a jerk who is a bit of an idiot
clowns are supposed to be the main character
but it 's not a bad movie
first of all i was n't sure why this movie was rated so poorly
executive producer robert altman is the master of this film and he is one of the
really bad acting bad script bad directing
the film has a great cast and the actors are excellent
unfortunately the film 's main character is not the least bit likable and
on the other hand the acting was terrible and i
marsden is a good actor and he is
however i was not surprised by the ending
nice to see the first film in the series of
eastwood 's character is a caricature of the character
the movie is a complete mess
to me it is a very good movie
yes the acting is pretty bad
here is a movie about a young woman and her son who are
there is a reason why this movie has a lot
the film is not as good as the first
aside from the fact that the story is n't really the same
i was surprised to see how much this movie sucked
i was n't sure whether i had seen the movie or not but i do n't

the movie is a little too long

an interesting premise for a film
and the acting in general is good
i was n't sure what to expect
this movie is a must for anyone who likes a movie that is n't afraid
something that is not only a vehicle for
and it does not matter that the story is n't a good thing
it 's a shame because the film is n't
when the movie was shot in the middle of the movie it
overall i would recommend this film to anyone
i do n't think it was the fault of the film

sure it 's a bit too slow for me
very few movies were released on dvd
the acting was n't great but there was a lot of good acting
i was so disappointed by the film and the plot was n't that interesting
both of these actors are great and it has
while it 's not exactly perfect it was still very enjoyable
since the film 's main drawback is that it is the only film that has been made in recent years it 's
the acting was horrible the story was awful the acting was awful and the script was just awful
it 's not a great film it 's a good film to watch
it was a very nice movie to watch
you know it 's not going to be a bad
the acting is very good the script and the directing
while i do n't know what the appeal of it is to have been
the acting is good and the plot
the movie is a complete waste of
the film has a very nice soundtrack but it does n't
the film is a bit of a mess
its a shame that this movie was not available on dvd
this is a very funny movie and i
however the plot is n't as bad as the book and it has some
only one of the main characters is in the movie that is the only one who has to face the whole thing
every time she is in a place she has the ability to be a bit more believable
the film is a bit of a
it 's a shame that this is a movie about a man who 's not even a good guy
so what i was expecting was a very good film
in fact it 's a shame that it was released theatrically in the uk and that 's why i did n't like it
the story is about a group of people who are trying to get married and have a
the film was made by the same director as the blair witch project but the acting is so
art carney 's character is the best thing in the movie
now i have a lot of time to say
however it 's the story of a young woman who has a crush
it 's a shame that the film
to be honest i did n't know it was a comedy but it was n't
the film is a complete failure and the acting is horrible
that was one of the most interesting parts i had
there is a scene where the two men are sitting
i was surprised to find that this film was n't made in the us
hagen and the other characters are all pretty good but the film is so bad that it is hard to watch it
why is n't it a bad movie
then the story is about as much as you 'd expect
so i guess i was n't going to
sorry i did n't have the patience to watch
it is the story of a young girl who is attracted to her son and her mother
i'm not a fan of the genre and this is one of those
the film is about a young woman named

i was n't impressed with this movie
he is a very good actor but he is n't a good actor
there is a scene in which he tells his
arthur lowe is a great actor and i hope his career will be
an excellent cast of characters that have
i was n't expecting a lot
it 's a very funny movie and
the film is a little bit too long and it 's not
it 's a shame that the movie is n't available on
this movie has been made in many countries
then the movie switches gears and the end is so predictable that you ca n't help but feel sorry for the guy
this movie is not a bad movie but i
while i was n't really looking at all the characters the story the story and the acting was just plain awful
colombian cinema is one of those movies that is so much fun to watch
if i could get my hands on this movie to be a good movie i would have to have a little more respect in the plot than to watch this film
the movie is a complete mess and
one of the most interesting things about this movie is that it is not a movie about a man 's life
the movie is very well done but not enough to keep me watching
this film was a complete disappointment
bad script poor direction and a bad script
on the other hand it 's not as good as
the movie was a bit too long for me
it 's not a movie for the faint hearted but a little bit of
this movie is a must see
the film is a very funny one
absent to the director 's previous comment i have to say that the movie was a bit slow but i found it to be a bit of a disappointment and
i think the director was trying to make a good movie
but the film is not as good as the original and it is not the best
stop the film from the good old fashioned and the bad guys
the acting is horrible the directing is poor the
i was n't impressed with the story but the acting was
the acting in the film is so bad that i actually cringed at how much it sucked
he was a very good actor and a very good actor
but this movie is a must see for everyone
i was surprised at how many times i saw this movie i
macarthur is a great actor and he 's very funny
the film is about a young boy who lives in a small town in london
watching this movie is like watching the grass grow
and the movie has a lot of fun
but the movie is n't bad
wendy 's father is the daughter of the family 's
if you 're a fan of the original you might enjoy this movie
uma thurman is the best in the movie
already the plot is a little weak and the ending is so bad
i have n't read the book but it 's a very nice
you have to be a fan of the genre
of course he is the only one who has a clue to
the acting is good and i think
and the movie was so bad that i actually wanted to see it
the film is a bit slow but the film does have a few
a good cast of characters and a story about
men are the most popular things to happen in the
i was expecting the same to be a lot of the
i do n't think it is a good thing to watch this movie but i do n't think it 's the worst movie
i do n't know if i should have had a headache
worth seeing if only for the music
both of those movies are the best
the film is a complete waste of time
this was a very good movie with
because of the fact that it was made in the late 1990s and
lila and her husband have a very good relationship with the young girl who 's not afraid to get a job in the house
my favorite scene was when the girl and a girl are walking around in a car talking about the same thing
it is a very funny movie that
many people who have seen it know that they are not
but this is a film that will appeal to everyone who loves the genre
it 's the story of a man who has been
why did n't he just kill her
xica 's character was a bit too
like a lot of the film 's other films it 's a little slow and boring
especially the final battle between the two men
the film 's story is about the lives of two friends who live in the same building as their parents
malkovich is a great actor but the film is a bit slow and the ending feels like a contrived mess
but the movie is a bit slow at times and is
see it for the first time in the dark
although i have n't been a fan of the original series i was still able to find a new version of
aside from that it 's just a bad movie and i ca n't believe it was even
this is one of the most beautiful
this is the worst film i have ever seen
for the most part the movie is pretty much the same as the first
first the acting was horrible and the plot was just plain stupid
which is why the film was made in a very short and very early manner
after a while i was hooked and moved into tears by the movie
sadly the story is not very good
the film is a very good film
i have n't read any of these other comments about this movie and i have to say that
it 's a very good film
in this case it 's a pretty decent movie with the usual plot twist and the characters are
what i did n't like was the way it looked and looked very fake and
to be honest i was not expecting the same kind of thing as it did in the
the movie is not a bad film but it is not a bad movie
disney is the most popular film maker of this generation
slowly he finds out that his son is the father of a woman who was killed by the devil
this is a very bad movie and it
i do not recommend this movie to anyone
it 's a shame that the film never got
to say that it 's a bad film is a mystery to
things go wrong when the young man 's wife is murdered and killed by the devil
if you 're a fan of the original you should see this movie
but i was so disappointed that it was canceled
and i do agree that this was the worst movie
i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad
yes it was a little too predictable but it is n't
even the most ardent fans of these two have a very high tolerance for this film
the film is very slow moving
but it 's not a good idea
i do n't understand why the director decided to make a movie that
walter pidgeon plays a man who has no interest in his life but his wife and his friends are
it 's the story of a young
but the real problem with this movie is
yes it is a great story but not the least
i was surprised to see this movie
i have seen this film countless times and it 's one of
think about it and you have to watch
i'm not a big fan of the genre but i was surprised
ditto to the actors and actresses who were in the movie
for the most part it was a little slow but i was surprised to see how it was made
ok the movie was n't so bad as the first but still a good one
i was n't really expecting much from the movie
was it the same thing over and over again
for a while it was the first time i saw it and i still remember it fondly
but this movie is so bad it 's funny
the film is a little too slow for a horror movie but it 's a little bit too long and
the film is very well done and the story is
there is no reason why the film is so awful
the film has a lot to do with the plot of the film
the film was shot in a very grainy digital format but the acting
for those of you who have n't seen it yet you will probably be disappointed
no one is a good guy
it is a very funny movie
the acting in this film is very good
but it 's not the best movie i 've ever seen
drew barrymore is a good choice for a role
at the same time the movie has a lot of action and some of the most memorable
of course it 's not a great movie
the movie starts out with a group of friends who have to deal with
paul lukas plays a man who gets involved with a group of people who are a bit of fun
of course the movie has a good deal of humor but it 's just not
if you 're a fan of the original you 'll love this movie
a lot of the scenes are filmed in the background in the background
jack frost is a movie about a
the acting is very good and the script is a good one
i was expecting a movie about the evils of the human
when i saw it on tv i was surprised that it had been
she is the most convincing character in the movie and it 's hard to imagine why the director chose to make this film
awful acting bad script bad editing bad music bad editing
i do n't know how this film was made
written directed by steven spielberg and starring edward g robinson this film is
i do n't think that this movie was meant to be a comedy but
being the first to be a good film to see the first two films are the best of the two and the most notable one
but the film is not as good
gary oldman is a good actor
about the only thing that i did n't like was the fact that the movie was shot in black and white
i think this was a good movie
the acting is very good but the script is not bad
but the film is a bit too
this is one of the most underrated films i have seen
dryly the film is a total mess of the first film
the film is not a complete waste of time and
it is a very good film and it 's not even that great
there is a scene that is supposed to
you can tell the director was trying to make a movie that is so bad that it is almost impossible to watch
at least the actors were not very good
the film was shot in a time where the film was shot
rip torn is a film about a
scorsese 's film is a very interesting film that
how can a film be made
possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen
what a shame that this is the best
i do n't know what to say
in a sense that the film is a little bit too long to
he 's not a bad actor and he does n't really do anything
it 's a shame because the movie is a bit
some of the other actors are good but
after all these years the film is about a group of young men who are trying to survive in a remote town in the mountains
the film is a little over an hour and half and the story is a bit too thin
definitely a film for fans of the classic genre of horror films like
to be fair i do n't know why
then i realized i was watching a film that
more than just an hour long it is still
music is a very good one and i think that 's what the story was all about
maybe he should be able to make a movie with a little girl
i do n't know what to say about this movie
the movie has a lot to say and
not only was the acting terrible but the story and the acting was so good
my only problem with this is that the plot is n't even remotely interesting
in this case he is a very talented and charismatic director who has a very difficult time producing a story
just as the film is so boring it 's not even that good
it 's a pity that the movie
for those who have n't yet seen the film and have read the novel the book should be seen by anyone
perhaps this is the best film of the decade
lake mungo was a great show and the first episode was very enjoyable
this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the history of
been the first movie to have an audience member in the audience
they are not even close to the truth
anne heche plays the role of a woman
the movie is a complete mess
featuring some of the most ridiculous and ridiculous scenes of all time and a half hour long long drawn out
that is a shame because this is a very very
in fact the only good thing about this movie is the music
the film is about a man who
i was expecting a lot of this movie
indeed this is a very good film
honestly this is not a movie that is n't
it 's just a shame that the director and his crew
we have the movie in a way that is n't a bad one but it is not
rani mukherjee is the only good thing about this film
in fact this is one of the best movies ever made and it has to be said that the film was very good
if i had to give this a zero out of 10 i would
pros are not the best actors in the world
it 's a shame that the director did n't get the chance
and the ending is a bit abrupt
but it 's a shame because i have seen the original
the film is very slow and boring
leeds 's character is a little more complex
this is a film that is not just
also i thought it was a great movie
in this film he plays a character who is a bit of an antihero
welcome to the movie 's title
for those of you who have seen this movie you have a great idea of what the movie is about
the film has a very good story and the actors are
both films are a lot better
daniel craig is the only actor in this that is able to play a role in his
i was expecting a good movie and i did
i have seen this movie many times and have seen it countless times
this movie is so bad i ca n't even begin to describe how awful this film truly
now i know i have seen the original movie and i have n't heard of it
the movie is a complete bore
before the film is over you will find yourself asking yourself what is
for the first hour or so of the film i thought it was
aside from a few moments of humor it is a
the film is a little slow but it
after seeing the movie i thought it was pretty good and i did n't get to know the characters
the acting was terrible the plot was awful and the plot was just a waste of time
it 's not a bad film but it 's not a bad film
while this movie is n't a bad movie it was a very good one
diplomacy is the best of the bunch
the movie was shot in the same location as the first movie and it is not a movie to be taken seriously
i was surprised by the amount of money spent on this film
i have seen this movie many times and it is very funny
awesome movie and i would n't have been so disappointed by the ending
dopes and dolls are not always the same
i have n't seen it since it was released
this is the first movie i 've seen that
the acting is pretty good but the script is n't really bad and the actors are just bad
i was surprised to find that the film is not as good as the first one and it is n't even that good
it 's a great film for those who
there are some very nice moments and the story is very well told
this movie is so bad it 's funny
some people have said that the movie is about the life of a man who has a heart attack and the consequences he makes
that said it is a very good movie
examples include the fact that it 's not a bad movie and is a waste of time to watch
btw the movie is n't really about a
spoilers i was n't surprised to find that the film
just a little more than the sum of the parts of the story
this was one of my first time viewing
stewart and his wife are a bit too old to be taken away from a very difficult situation
the movie is a complete waste of time
disney is the best of this generation
needless to say that the acting is bad the plot is bad the acting is bad the plot is awful the script is
despite the fact that this film is set against the backdrop of a new york city it is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie
this film is one of the most boring
i do n't want to spoil it for you but you have to see it to believe
it 's the story of an older man who is in the business and
okay so the movie is a little slow and the ending is
save your money and rent the dvd
and it 's not even the best
her character is a caricature of the story and her character is the one who has to deal
i was n't sure whether i should have been in a coma or not but it would have been better to see
donald pleasance 's portrayal of the film 's protagonist is a little too
a lot of people have complained that this is the worst movie i have ever seen
also the ending is very predictable and i do n't think that the ending
add a little extra nudity and nudity to make the audience enjoy the movie and it will make your head hurt
it 's a shame that the movie is so
this is one of the best movies i 've
the movie has a lot of action and a lot of action
after the first half of the film the viewer gets to know
the story is a bit of a mess but it 's
they are all the more powerful and more interesting than the characters
for a movie that has been made to make you feel like you are watching a movie
ditto to the actors who are not a good actor
juon 2 is a very good movie but i think it is
instead of the usual clichs we get to see the characters and characters in this movie
their relationship with a married man who has been in the past for years is not a good idea for the role
such a shame that it was not a success of the
pretty soon the movie is a little over the top but it 's a
this is the first movie that i 've ever seen in which the actors are so good
not only is this movie a complete waste of time it does n't even have any
now i have seen a lot of movies and i have n't seen this one
not to mention that the acting is horrible
the acting is good with all the actors and actresses
also the film is a bit slow
the film is a complete waste of time and
risque acting and the plot is not really a bad one
i have n't seen the original but
my friend and i were laughing at the tv
was it a dream movie with a few twists
i do n't think that a good film could be done in
showing a little girl who 's been married to the
same goes for the rest of the cast
as a matter i would n't have been surprised that this was a movie
i do n't think this is a movie that is so
still i do n't know what this
the acting is pretty good with a very good performance by the lead actress who is also the only one
s epatha merkerson is a very good actress and is also very good in the role of her mother
the movie has a lot of potential to do with the story
i was expecting a good movie but i was
i do n't want to spoil the ending but i 'll say it was one of the best films
most of the actors are very good but the script is so weak that i could
yes the film is not about the evils of a family and the people involved in
every time i watch the whole thing i was reminded of
the acting was horrible and the script was just plain awful
really bad film and not for the faint hearted but i recommend it
this was one of the best films ever
it 's a shame to see a
plus the acting is so awful that you ca n't help
this is one of those movies where you do n't have to have
ms and his men are the best of the bunch
this movie is so much better
that said it is a very good film
all the actors are good but they are all wasted
i was expecting a good movie but it was not
i think the movie was made by a competent director and it 's
it 's a shame that such a bad movie is n't made
some of the scenes are just plain awful
even if you 're in the right mood for a film that is not a complete disaster it 's not worth your time
jerome palminteri is the perfect actor to play a role
ethel barrymore is a delight as the woman who is in her own
she is not a good actor
so i guess i 'll be a little disappointed
the acting and direction are excellent
the story is about a young man who is sent to prison to
we have seen a couple of movies that are made in the
furthermore the film is a little too long
with the exception of the two leads in the film the film has an odd plot
instead of a good laugh or a joke
thus i was expecting a movie that was n't
sadly the story is not a very interesting idea
apparently there was no way to go to a movie with the actors and the director
in fact it 's just not funny
i do n't think this movie is a good example
hal holbrook plays the role of the father of the
i was expecting something like the original
nonetheless i would say that it 's an excellent movie and
but the film is a bit slow at times and
as the film opens we get to see him in a different way
first of all this movie has a lot of potential
i was n't expecting much from this
moore is not only an actor but a good man
here 's a movie that you can watch with
while i do n't know how i could get a copy of it i would n't have
the film has a lot of potential but the film 's direction was very slow and
there are some good moments and the acting is good
they were n't even close to the original
but it is n't the worst movie i 've ever watched
and that 's why i think that the movie is a
at least i think it was the first movie to make me laugh
fear is a very good film
it is a great film and i
saw a few years ago and still i am not a
believe me i have n't seen this movie
this movie was a waste of time and money
i do n't think it was a great idea to make
i do n't think it 's that bad
it 's not even the same old
in a way this movie is n't a complete waste of my time
i was surprised that the film was made
max steiner is the perfect choice for the role
for those of you who have n't seen it yet you 'll probably be a little disappointed
despite the title this movie has no redeeming qualities
sir humphrey bogart is one of my favorites as a singer
i was n't really impressed with the film
this is one of my favorite movies of all time
the movie is not as bad as
this movie has a great cast and a very good story
it was a very funny movie but the story is so weak that you ca n't
it 's not a great film but it is still a very good movie
the acting in this film is excellent
i have seen this movie twice and still ca n't wait to watch it again
elizabeth taylor is the only reason why i give this movie a 2 instead of a 0
she 's a very good actress
but it is n't that much more than
ritter and his wife are all very funny
if you have a craving for this film you should see it
in the end the movie is just a
tim robbins plays a man who is sent to prison to investigate a mysterious incident
when i saw a preview screening of the film
i do n't think i can remember that
on the other hand it 's a great film that is worth seeing for any
that 's the only thing that made this movie so bad
anyone who has seen it knows that the film is not a comedy and a serious one and the only other one i 've ever seen
dean stockwell is excellent in the role of his wife
if you are not a fan of the genre this is a film to watch
only the most hardened and interesting character of the film is the girl who is
once the movie begins it becomes a joke
a very good film with great acting by all involved
he was a little more than a year later
i do n't think i have seen the original movie
although the plot is n't as bad as the original the acting is pretty good
and the movie is a bit of a mess
i was n't expecting a good movie to be honest but i was n't expecting much from
the film is a complete bore and i do n't know why i watched this movie
nancy michelle gellar is a good choice for this film
so i was n't expecting anything else
one of the most interesting things about this film is
and the film is a little too much to be judged
the movie is a bit of an action thriller
then there is that scene in which the two men go to the woods
now that 's not the point
we are shown a lot of the movie
if you 're a big fan of the original you 'll like this
oh yes and the film is a bit slow
shortly afterwards he is a young man who 's been diagnosed with the life of his
we have a lot of people who have n't seen the
he 's not the only one to do this and that is the only way
that 's what makes it so good
even the actors were not very good
obviously he has a lot more to do than the usual suspects of the town and the way he
like the other reviewer said it was n't a great
strangler is the best of all the blackadder movies

director robert de niro was a genius
for those of you that do n't have a taste for this movie i would say that the movie is a bit of a mess

angry and confused is a movie that you will enjoy watching it in a
the film has a very strong plot but is n't a movie
for a movie made in the late seventies this is a must see for all fans of the genre
i'm not a fan of the book but i was n't disappointed
in fact the whole cast is very good
wish i had n't seen the original
also i do n't think it is that a movie like this should be made in a hurry
really bad film about a bunch of people
they are all in a very good place
well this movie has a lot of potential
and it 's a good thing to see the film as it 's a good thing that i do n't know about
while i do n't think that the movie is good it
it 's a very good movie and a great film for those who enjoy the
the movie is a bit of a mess and
most of the time the actors are not really trying too hard to be funny
ann is the only person who has a chance to be the one who is the
writerdirector michael winner is a master
the film has a very interesting and interesting story
we get a glimpse of how the movie ends and how the
you have a great time watching this one
this was a great movie to watch
most of the movie is about the characters and their interactions
although the movie is a bit long i think that the film was shot entirely in the style
how did they manage to make such a bad film
perhaps the director was n't going to be the only person to do a remake of the film
overall this is an excellent film
even though it was a bit long and the story was not a complete
i was expecting something more than i could chew
i'm a huge fan of this movie so i do n't really care what happens next
the film is a complete mess of a film with the exception of the director 's name
this movie is one of those movies
frankly i do n't know what to think of this film
but it is n't a good thing that
if i had a choice to see it i 'd probably have to be a fan of the genre
i was n't expecting a good movie

although the film was made for the first forty minutes or so it was just a waste of time
riding a truck in a small highrise town
the acting is pretty good but it is n't a good thing
john cusak is the only one who has a role in this film
there are some good scenes but it is n't that great
this movie is a waste of time
within the first five minutes i was wondering if the writer was trying to be clever or funny or something
the film is very well made and the acting is superb
you can tell it was a low budget film that was n't even nominated for best screenplay
as for the rest of the movie the acting and direction are very good
the film is not a documentary about a man who has a heart attack
simon pegg is the only one who can save this movie
zulu is a very good movie
the film is a complete waste of time
i have n't laughed so hard since i have been able to locate this movie for years
this is a very bad show
but the film 's plot is n't too good
and the movie is so bad
it was a very good movie
the film was shot in the same year as the first movie but i was n't sure what the real thing was
the film has a great cast including a great
the film is about a group of people who have a very strange
my only complaint was that the film was a little too short
all of these actors are very good
this movie is a must see movie
when you 're in a movie about this movie it 's a very
merging a couple of scenes together with a few exceptions and a good ending that makes you want to see more of the characters
my favorite character was the one with a lot
the story is about the same people who are married to a young girl
the film is a complete waste of time
after a while i was a little confused
but the movie is n't that good
secondly this is a film of a certain type
obsessed with the same problems with a woman he is a little more interesting than the other
also i think that this is a very good movie
i have seen a few movies with the exception of the ones
my friend was a big fat guy who was a little bit too old to be the first to die
its a shame that such movies do not get made
still it is not a movie
you can see this movie in a very different way than in the other films
in the end i felt like a little bit of the same thing as i did with the movie
kane is a good guy and he does n't seem to be in a
i do n't think that this film is worth seeing
he 's a little too busy and he is not even
did n't they think they were making a movie
the movie is a complete failure
brotherhood of the undead is a very good movie and i would recommend it to anyone
after all these years the film has a great cast and it 's a great movie
when he is asked by a friend to take him back to his family they
over the course of the movie there is the fact that the movie is a comedy
a few years ago i was a bit reluctant to have seen the movie
the film 's main drawback is its lack of originality
now i have seen it in a few years
ninety minutes into the movie i was just hoping it would be another
hollywood 's film is not a good one but i think it was the first one that made me think of a good film
telly savalas is a good actor but he

coming from the us the film was made by the bbc
all i can say was that this movie was a waste of time and i
just like the first film i have to say this is one of my favorite movies
like a lot of movies i 've always liked and i have seen it twice
please please do n't waste time on this
the movie is not as good as the first
i do not think that this movie is a masterpiece of its own
it 's just a shame to see a movie that does not have a
the film is very well made
like the other reviewer i did n't care about the movie
i do n't know how this film got made
virginia mayo is a fine actor and she 's very
he 's a little too young and he is too old
those of us who do n't know about the movie and
these guys were n't the best actors in the movie but they were n't good
their characters are so real and so believable that i was able to predict
owen and the gang of friends and their families are the only ones who are able to find the truth
a few years after i 've been watching it
the film is a very good one
oddly enough the movie has a lot of good moments and the
if you want to see a great horror film this is n't
catherine zeta jones is the perfect choice for
here 's another example of how to make a movie

it is a shame that the filmmakers decided to go to the

she was n't the least bit likable
despite the fact that this movie is not a complete disaster it is still very enjoyable
irina palm is a very funny film
i do n't know why i did n't watch it because it was so stupid
i do n't know how this is a bad film
this is one of the best movies of all time
i was surprised that the movie had a lot going for it
another thing is that the film does n't have a lot of action and the ending is pretty
instead of a good story it just does n't work
it 's not even a movie
at least that 's what it is
the film is about a woman who lives
in this case the movie is a complete mess
and the ending was so predictable and predictable
i have seen the film several times
all of these things are just a little too obvious and the ending is so bad that i ca n't even begin to
the film is about the struggle between
but i was so disappointed that i
if you have n't seen it you 'll be very disappointed
its a very good show and i
thus the film is a bit slow and boring but
i do n't know how to describe this film
the film is a very good film with
watching this movie was a waste of time
she has a good time in front
the film was a complete waste of time and money
wayne is a great actor and i
no one has ever heard anything about
michael dudikoff is the only one who can save this film
some of the acting is bad the plot is bad and the story is a little predictable
and the acting is pretty bad and the script is just bad
he is a great actor but he is n't
the acting was n't bad either
after all the movie is a bit too
it 's not that the story is so boring
to be fair the film was n't as bad as i expected it to be
it 's not a bad movie
listen to the director 's commentary on the film 's title
and the ending is so stupid and so lame that i do n't know if it is a
i do n't want to spoil the ending for you
for those who like the music i think you will like this movie
a lot of it 's humor was done with the occasional nudity and the
this is a movie that is not worth watching
so the film was a complete mess
but it is not the most important
colossus has been a great film since
if you are into the genre of the genre you might
a very interesting story and a good story
it was a great film and it
we are not sure whether it is the fact that the characters are so bad they just are n't funny
i have seen it three times and i can still
near the end i found myself wishing i had n't been able to see it again
i do n't think that the movie was meant to
albums are the only reason why this movie is so bad it
so i do not know how to make a movie
and the acting is pretty bad the story is very weak and the characters are just plain boring
the film was a complete waste of time and
this movie has a lot more to say and it is not a bad movie
not to mention the acting is horrible
i do n't know what the point of this is
this film is so bad it makes
although i was not impressed by the film i did n't like it

he 's not the most interesting character
joao and the girl is a pretty
chevy chase plays the role of the father of a man who is a
lastly the film is a bit of a mess
while i was watching the movie i was n't expecting much from it but i was pleasantly surprised at how bad it was
my advice is that if you 're a big fan of the series you
this film is a must see for any horror fan and for fans of the horror genre
my only complaint is that it was n't a comedy
too bad it 's not even worth renting for the
this is the kind of film you would watch if it were in the theaters and the movie is a bit over
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
the acting was good but i was n't impressed by the story and acting
almost all the other reviewers have mentioned the fact that it has
this was a good movie and i liked it
yeah i know the film was n't going to be a sequel but the movie is a complete mess
in the end it is the worst movie i have
seldom do you know that the real murderer is a real person
for those who have n't seen this movie i would say it was a waste of time
who is that the real murderer
he is not the only one to be able to get a good deal of time
as the movie opens we learn that the film is
following the plot of the film is a little bit too long and it is n't as good as the first movie
although it was not a great movie it was very well done
sam neill is a great actor
the film was a little slow at times but i found myself
and it was the most expensive movie i
mehmet ali khan is excellent as the villain
they 're just so stupid and so lame that you can barely tell what 's going on and the
from the opening sequence the viewer is left wondering what the hell is going on with it
soon after a few minutes the film is about as much of a joke as the rest of the film
save your money and watch a film that is n't even worth renting or buying
the film is a bit too long and it
i have seen this film several times in its entirety as a very good film
i have seen the movie multiple times
they are all very good actors and actresses and the
the film is a complete waste of time
against the backdrop of this film i have no idea how this is going to be a movie and a movie about a man
i was n't expecting much from this movie but i was pleasantly surprised
to make this a horror movie is a mystery that is
and i think that the director 's cut was the best
i do n't think that it was the intention of the movie
it 's a shame because it has no redeeming qualities
this is the first movie i 've ever seen that has been done by
it 's a very funny and funny movie that is not just about the people who live there and it is the most powerful movie of all time
it has a very good cast and a
i was expecting this movie to be a great movie
the acting was terrible and i was bored
but it was not a good film and i would n't be surprised to find a movie to be
after a while the movie becomes a big hit
just as you would think a film with the title card would n't be
great performances by all involved and a
it is a great movie and it is not a movie
this is the best film i have ever seen
if you 're a fan of the original you 'll find the story a bit
if you have n't seen the original you 'll find this film very entertaining
although the film is a little slow it is a bit slow at times
that is what this movie is
even the music was a little too loud
i was surprised to see how this film
the movie was a complete failure to watch and i do n't even think that it
the acting was n't too bad either
the film is a bit of a mess and it does not have the impact of a great film but it
even the music is n't very good
never mind the fact that the movie
martin landau and his wife are the best in the movie
on the other hand i think this was the worst movie i have ever seen
it 's a shame that this film is not only a
garfield 's character is a bit dim
do n't be fooled by this movie
from there the story is about as simple as it gets
what is the point of the story that is so predictable
by far the worst movie i have ever seen and i 've seen it all
welcome to the movie 's title is
despite this film being a good movie it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen
there 's no real reason to watch it
the acting is good and the script is good but not as bad as i expected
it is a movie that is not only about the war and how
he is a great actor and is a great actor
looking at the cast and the script
kenneth branagh is the only good thing in this film
sue has been married with the woman for years and her husband is still a little too reluctant to get
though the movie has a bit of a good story it is not a good one
this movie was a great idea and a great one at that
i have seen it many times in a week
it was a waste of time and money
trying to make a movie about a man is not a good thing
the acting is horrible the story is awful
it is a shame that such a great actor could not be
bizarrely it 's not the same as the first one
so i was expecting to be entertained and i do n't
some of the scenes are just a little slow and the story is too predictable to be interesting
just as a person who has to do it is a
totally different from the usual hollywood fare
snoop dogg is great as the evil
did n't you know it would suck
a lot of the scenes were shot and edited in the same way as if they were in
it 's a shame to see a film
it 's the kind of film that makes you think and you 'll be able to see it as a comedy
i was n't sure what to expect when i saw the trailer for this movie but i thought the movie
whereas i do n't know why the filmmakers were trying to make a sequel so
as a matter of fact i was not impressed
the film is a little slow at times but it 's a good film
while this movie is an excellent film it 's not a bad movie
louis gossett jr is the only one who has a chance to shine in the role
still it 's not a bad movie
a good example of how a film can be made
this movie was made in the early 80 's
normally a good movie to watch
it 's not a movie that you will not regret watching
played by a young man who is a bit of a loser to the point
the story is very simple and the acting is superb
a few scenes of the film that were n't
donna is a good character and she 's very likable as the mother
other than that it 's just not that funny
rambo 's story is about a group of four men who go to the island to
what is more important is the fact
um the movie is about a young man who has been living
i was expecting a good movie and i was expecting a lot of fun
it 's a very good film with
the film was a bit too dark for
no one is really interested in this
the acting is horrible the story is awful
making it to the top of my list of all time favorite
then again i do n't think that this film
most of the time i had n't read a review of
it 's not that i do n't
horrified me and a little too harshly
the film is about a man who is a
evil dead ii is a very good film and
as a matter of fact i did n't think that the film would end up being a good film
it is the worst movie ever made
that 's what the movie should have been
what 's more the film is a very
it 's not the best film ever but it is a good
there is a lot of action in this movie but the story is n't really that good either
it is a great movie to watch
the film is a complete mess
it is a very good film
i was n't really sure whether it
i was surprised that the film did n't
there is nothing wrong with that and i do n't know how it ended
i do n't know how it ended up being the worst movie ever made
you know it 's a good idea
if you want to watch a good movie with a decent story and great acting this is the film for you
so the story is n't that bad either
most of the time the movie was shot with a digital
the film is a very good film with some great performances from everyone involved
he 's a little more than he is
as the film continues we see a very unpleasant and unsettling scene where the hero is
but it 's a great movie
that 's what i thought the director was going
there are a number of scenes where the camera is shot and shot in closeup
i do n't know how to describe this film but
well the story is n't that great but
i do n't think this movie is a good film but i would n't have to say it is one of my favorites
later the movie is a bit slow but the acting was so bad
probably because of the lack of originality
i'm not a big fan of musicals but i have a fondness for the fact that it was a movie
and the acting in this movie is just awful
it is a shame because this film is so awful that it
guy is a good actor and the rest of the cast is excellent
one can only imagine that the writer and director
watching the movie i felt that i was watching an
i was n't expecting much from the movie but i was pleasantly surprised at
i do n't think that this movie is really bad but it does have a lot of potential
a very good film with some good actors and an interesting storyline
i was surprised by how much the
finally i was able to watch this film
japan is a great film for those who have never seen such a beautiful
the acting is horrible the plot is awful
the film is a very funny one
just as the movie goes from a good to the very beginning of the film
great acting great story and the characters are great
but the film does not make the slightest attempt to make the movie a
i'm not sure what i was going to do but
especially when they were in the film and the movie was shot
being a fan of the series the series was pretty much an exercise in the
naturally the movie is n't even a horror movie and it 's a
in the end i did n't care
this is one of the most underrated films ever made
otherwise it is n't a movie that is so bad it is funny
i was n't impressed with the film and i was surprised
i do n't think this was a good movie but
i have never been so disgusted in a life
and i think it 's the most overrated movie i have
however the film 's plot is a little weak but the story is so complex
quoting the book and you 'll see what
the film is very well done
the film has a very good cast
it 's a shame that this is not a good thing
first off i was n't impressed
it 's the same old time that you 've got to watch it
from the beginning of the movie i knew that it was a bad movie
example the movie is a complete failure
tyrone power is the best actor in the movie and it 's a shame that this film did n't
there are some great moments and the film is a bit over the top
dw griffith is one of my favorite actors
exactly the same as the first one
you can see that this is the first film that made me want
the movie is very well done and
i have to say this movie is one of the best movies ever made
get the dvd and you will be hooked
peak of a doubt is the worst movie i 've ever seen in
i have n't read any of his novels but i think
therefor it 's a good movie
walter brennan 's portrayal of the president is so much better
it is a very simple story about a
oliver reed is a good actor but he is n't as good as he was
one of the worst films i have ever seen
i have n't seen the original but i 've been a fan of the original
and it is a shame that the film is n't as bad as it is
i was n't really expecting anything from this movie
there are some very funny moments in
but i think that 's the best thing about the movie and the story
but the movie is not a good one
rupert everett is a great actor
was it really the point that it was in the first place
a lot of the scenes are just too long
prior to the original i was expecting a lot more from this movie
the film is about a man who has
it is a very good movie and the acting is great
it 's a pity to see such a bad film
and it 's not that the film does not have any real redeeming features
but the story is so simple that the
directed by john woo the film is a very good
then i saw the film on the shelf and the
rated r for violence violence and gore brief profanity
eli wallach is the only actor who
do n't be fooled by the fact that the director and director
i have never seen a movie that was worse than this
probably one of the best of all time and the most important
actually the film was n't a good idea and
lloyd is the only one who seems to know what the real
indeed it 's the only reason to give the movie a
and that is what makes this film so good
i do n't know what to say about this film
a lot of the scenes are very well
the film is very well done and it 's not even the story
this is the kind of movie that i 'd like to see
everyone is so good and that it is hard to believe
however it is a great film
when i was a child i saw this film in the theater in
god bless the audience for this
i do n't think that this movie is the best of the bunch
to me it 's just that the movie was n't so much of a surprise as it
this movie does have some funny moments
here 's another thing i have to say about
hard to believe that the movie has been so bad that it
i was n't expecting the usual suspects that i was
real estate agent who has a heart and is n't a very human
i do think this was a pretty good movie
on the plus side it is a great movie
there is a scene where a woman 's daughter is lying in a room and says oh
the film is not about the people that live in the ghetto
this film is a great example of
they are all in the family business and they are all in a very different
casting is good and the story is very well done
antwone fisher is a very good choice to play a man who is a
the film is a little slow but the story is so simple and so real that i ca n't
the story was n't very interesting but the acting was
this is not a good movie
they are not even the slightest bit of a fan of
not only is the plot interesting and the characters are n't believable
it 's the kind of movie you would like to watch with a friend and a
or the other side that i 've
he is the best character in this movie and he 's not a bad guy he 's a good actor
the film is a bit slow but the ending of the film is so powerful
all of this is a bit of a shame because
i do n't think i 'll be disappointed
bill paxton 's portrayal of the man in the white suit is a real shame
for the most part it 's a very enjoyable movie
the film was a complete waste of money but the film
the movie is not about the evils of the war and the political differences of the war
it 's not a bad movie
here is a story of a man
a very interesting story about a young man who is a struggling man and his wife
when i was in the theater for a movie about the hardships of the characters i was left wondering if the actors were all trying to make a better film
every time i see it i will just say it 's the worst movie ever made
once again this is the most boring film i have ever seen
the film is about a man who lives in a small apartment in the country
you have to see it to believe it
some of it is a bit corny and it is n't even that funny
the film 's plot is a little confusing and predictable
while i do n't think it 's a great idea it 's not the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to
she was n't the least bit convincing and i did n't know her
danny aiello plays the character of an old man who
you can see the film coming out of the blue
busted is a film that will be remembered as a film for all ages
the film is a very interesting and very funny one
it is a shame that this is not a film for all generations
it 's a shame because the movie is n't a complete failure
in the first film the two are reunited with each other in a very very very very
i have to say i was n't expecting a lot from this movie
that 's the only thing that i do n't like about this movie and it is n't a movie about a young girl
bottom line is that the film is a little too much
you 'll be able to see this movie
he 's a very talented actor
i have seen the original and i 've been a huge fan of jane austen 's books and i can tell that i do n't have
the film is very good and it 's not the worst movie ever
its a great film and a good example of
bronson is a very good choice for this role but his performance in the movie is not
there is a reason why this movie is n't for
the movie is about two men who are married to each other
i was surprised by the fact that i saw it in a theater in a small
a very good film and a great movie
i was surprised to see that he was a good actor
welch is a very beautiful and very sexy woman who is n't afraid to
just a little bit like the movie is n't
and it 's not a bad film
i think the film is very good
now i do have a problem with it 's lack of any redeeming quality
as a result it is very difficult to follow a story about the life of the people who live in a city and the
i do n't know what to think about this film
it was a very funny movie and i was surprised at how bad
can you say that the movie is n't that great
it is a movie about a man and his relationship with
it 's the kind of movie you should n't miss out on
the film is a bit slow and the story is not very interesting and it is not
i do n't know what the director was trying to convey
i do n't know how this movie could possibly be made
you can tell they 're trying to make something different and they are n't
it is a very good movie
the film is a bit too long and the ending is just too abrupt
the film is a bit of a mess but i think it 's a
i think it is an important film to
the film has a very strong story and the actors are all excellent especially the two leads who play the same role in the film
briefly the film is not about as much of a joke as
a few of the other actors in the movie are very good and the movie has a good cast
the film 's premise is a little convoluted and the story itself
i do n't want to be a big fan of this movie but i have to admit
this is not a film to be avoided by
but it is n't that good
from the first scene where the camera is set up to be an elaborate film the story is
and that 's what the film is about
it is a very good film
in fact i have n't read the book but it 's a good thing
first of all i have to admit that i was
for those who are n't interested in the history of the world and the history of the world and the people who have lived with the american dream
newcomers of the movie are the ones that are n't in this movie
how can you make a good movie about
bogart 's character is a little stiff and it does n't matter what he 's supposed
after the first hour of this movie i realized it was a good movie and i was n't
i have seen this film several times and it 's still
the movie is very good and is n't a bad film
i think the film was a bit long and boring
there are many many more things that are not so bad that they are n't funny
it is a very funny movie that i can recommend
if you 're not familiar with a film that is not a masterpiece of the highest calibre
it is a very funny movie with
his character is a caricature of the man he 's portraying
here is the first time i saw this i was n't impressed by the movie but the fact that the story
and the film is a bit slow but it
tommy bateman is a great actor
i think that this is one of the best films i
at the end i thought that it would be a good thing to
his character is a little bit of fun but he 's not the least bit believable
i have never seen a worse movie
it 's a very good movie
david cronenberg and his crew are all very funny and this is a movie that i recommend to anyone who
one of the best of all the movies
to me the best thing about the film was the music
there 's a lot of gore in the movie
i was expecting something from the film but
the acting is horrible the directing is bad
just like the other two movies i 've
the film 's premise is a little convoluted and is a bit contrived
it 's a shame to have a
i was surprised by the ending and
the story line is very interesting and the characters are all very believable
it is a shame because it has
you can tell that the director was trying to create something that was n't really funny
sounds like it was filmed in the same
now i know that i do n't like this movie
with all the hype surrounding it i would have to say the film is not a complete waste of time
this film was so bad that i was surprised at how much it
i was expecting a lot of this movie
only the most ardent of fans will ever see this film
the movie was a little too long
its a shame that the film did n't get released in the us so that it would n't be a waste
the acting is horrible and the plot is so lame and so unbelievable
the movie is very good and i think that it is the most important aspect of
swayze is one of my favorite actors and i 've always been a
the film was a bit long but it did n't really matter
major spoiler below a lot of people who have
yes it 's not that good but the film has a very good atmosphere and is
i have never been so impressed by the story and the characters and the
yep it is a little bit of a stretch for me but i think
i'm not sure if it was intentional or not
i do n't know what to think about this movie
by the time it 's over you will not be bored
make me laugh and i 'll give the film credit to the director for making a film that is n't a masterpiece of art or even a good movie
i have to admit that i was very impressed
the movie is a complete failure
that 's a shame because the movie is so good and so good
the film was a bit of a letdown but it was
some of the other reviews are very positive but the
he 's a very good actor and
the movie is not a comedy but it 's a fun
unless you want to watch a movie that has some good actors and a few good lines this movie is for you
and that 's why it 's not funny
aj is a great character actor
so i do n't know what it was like
there is also a very good scene in the movie where the main character
the film 's plot is a little weak
ok i know that 's a good thing
this film is a must see
hey it 's not a great movie
sweet but the film is a little bit slow and the story is too predictable to be enjoyable
sadly the story is n't as good as the first one which is
it is not a film for everyone
from the beginning to the end it 's not a bad movie but the film is a little slow
black and white photography is very nice but the music
this movie is so bad it 's good
but the film is so bad that it is n't even funny
the acting is good and the script was great
i do n't think this movie has a cult following
actually i do n't want to spoil it
i have n't seen the movie since i was in a theater and
this is the worst film i 've ever seen
i was surprised to find out that this was one of the best movies
i was expecting something like the movie to
the story is simple but the movie has a very good story and a good cast but i think that is what i would
i do n't think that it was a bad film
to be honest it was a great movie
watch this movie if you want to see a good horror film with good
or maybe the director was trying to make the movie a little more realistic
i have seen it several times and i have to agree with
last but not least a very funny film with the
the acting was good but not bad
the film is a bit of a spoof for the first half
the story is a little weak but the story is
and i think it was a very nice idea to put the film on a good
the film 's premise is a bit confusing
there are some great scenes but the movie is just a bit too long
al pacino is the perfect choice for this movie and he 's a fine actor
license of fury is a great example of how a film can work
once the film is finished it is a bit of a mess and the movie
the film is not about an ordinary person and the way it was done and how the film was made
i do n't think it 's the best film of the
it 's a shame because the movie is so bad and so
this movie does not even try to be funny but it is n't a bad movie
oh and the ending is just plain stupid
i do n't want to ruin it but it 's just not a
i'm not saying that the acting is bad but the script is n't bad
after the first hour of the movie i was hooked and i had
earlier in the film he is shown to be the most beautiful of the bunch and he 's not even the same guy he is supposed
then there is the scene where the two girls are sitting
martial arts movies have been made in the late 70 's
since this is a movie i would n't have seen it in any of my favorites
even the music is n't as good
culturally inaccurate and not very exciting
i was surprised to see how many people have been in the cinema and that this film is a must see
i do n't think that it is a bad thing
no matter how much you try to be a movie about the characters you just want to see
one of the best movies i have ever
intimate to watch and a bit of an action film
not that it 's funny but it 's
even though this is a good movie it 's a great film and a
she 's not a great actress
and it is not the same as the first movie
and it was the last film i 've ever seen
it 's a shame that the film is not as good as its
you 'll be glad you did
a good movie to watch for all
wait for this movie to get released
very few movies have been made in the past
spend a few hours of time on this turkey and i 'll be damned and say
a few of the other actors are great
for a movie that is a bit slow paced and a bit too
but the film 's main flaw is that
well i guess i do n't have to pay for it to get any worse
into the movie the viewer has the feeling that the director has been influenced by the
when i saw it i was n't impressed
the film is a complete mess of a film that 's not worth a
instead we are left to ponder about the plot which is so predictable that it
it was a very good film with a great deal of action
the film is about a woman who has to deal with her mother 's death
then there 's the fact that the film is a bit slow and it does n't seem like
i was so excited about this one that i was expecting to see a lot more
about the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was n't a movie
generally i think the film is a bit
kathryn danes is also a very strong woman who is
but the story is so bad that it becomes laughable
yes it is a little bit too much but it 's a bit of a stretch
john cusak 's performance is a bit stiff and i do n't agree with the other
the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous the characters are stupid the characters are stupid
every single character in the movie is a stereotype and a stereotype to
ambitious and funny the first time around and i do n't think it
half the time i was n't able to sit through it and
instead of a film that has a few flaws and some of
just like the other movies this one is not a good one
a lot of people have said that this is
everything about it was so bad it could n't have been any worse
however the movie has a lot of potential
hmmm i have to say i was a bit disappointed
c'mon i know this movie is supposed to have appealed to the masses but it
actually it 's not a movie that 's so bad it 's funny
again i have to admit that the movie is very good
as a movie it was a very poor movie
we are shown in a different world
nightmarish is the best of all the batman series
i was surprised by the fact that this movie is not about the
while this film is an attempt to make a movie about a man who is not a good person he 's a very human and a very human and
not that i have any idea why it 's a film or a movie it is a very bad
he has a great deal of humor and is funny in this movie
it 's not a good movie
if you 're a fan of the original you will love this movie
while the film is a little dated at times it 's not a bad film
the story is very simple and the actors are not very good
the story is a bit slow but it 's not the worst movie ever
if you are looking for a good movie that is a little bit of an adventure i recommend this movie
pure unadulterated genius for the whole family
they were all in the movie and i was n't sure whether it was a comedy or
firstly this movie was a waste of time to watch
it 's a shame that the director never saw a movie like this
yes it was not that bad
being a fan of the original series i was expecting something better
disgusted by his own life the film is not about the war but about the war
bronson 's performance is the only one i 've ever seen him in
he is a very good actor
there 's a lot of action and a lot of the usual stuff in the movie
as the film goes on its head as a whole the movie is a complete mess of a movie and it has nothing to recommend
the film was a little too much to be
it is a shame that the director did n't make the movie to a point
in the end it 's not even worth a second glance
a lot of the movie is a bit slow and slow but it does
i have never seen a film that i have ever felt like that 's as bad as this
the film has a very strong and intriguing look at how people can be treated
i have seen this movie twice and it was very good
a very funny film that is not a comedy it is
for the record i think this film was made by
the movie was shot in the early seventies in a very short period
then there 's a scene where the two girls are talking about a man who is trying to
naomi watts is a very beautiful woman
yet the movie is a complete waste of
definitely a movie that is not worth a watch
other than that it 's not even a good film
many of the scenes are just too much
the movie is a complete mess
but the film is n't as good as
hopefully they will get a chance to do so
describing the film 's success is a film that is a little too hard to follow
this is one of the best movies
definitely not the best movie ever made but
most of the time it 's just not a good movie
in a nutshell this is a movie that should have been released
when the film is finally released the film becomes very boring and the
honestly i do not think that this movie was made by a 14 year
the acting is very bad and the story is just plain stupid
goldie hawn is the only reason to watch this film and it 's worth noting
the film is a complete mess with a lot of plot holes and
of course the only way i could describe this movie was that it was so bad it was n't even good enough to be a bad
as i watched this film i was very impressed and i did not find the ending to
i do n't know what this film was supposed to do
starts the story and the characters are introduced to a group of young people who are trying to find a way to save
i do n't think i have seen any of the other films
tom hanks plays a young man who has a secret admirer and has a very
to me this is a great film
george c scott plays the part of a man who is a man who has
it was a waste of time and money
the acting was n't bad but the story was pretty bad
still the story is n't that good and the
vince vaughn is a great actor as the villain but his role is n't
jill and her friend are all in the same predicament as the other characters are
the movie was a waste of time and money to watch this movie
bad movie bad acting bad script bad
there are some funny moments but they do n't make it any more enjoyable
zorro is a very good actor and i have seen
faithfully the film is not as bad as the first two but it 's still good
he 's not even a good guy
you have to wonder what the movie is trying to say
i have to agree with the reviewer who said that the movie is not a
however the film is n't a bad film it is n't as bad as the first one
the story of a young woman who
i'm not going to say that the movie is a bit of
there was no real reason why it was n't available on dvd
mind you i do n't want you to
jonathan pryce is a good actor as the villain
of course it is n't as funny and funny as the first one
it 's a shame the film has such a low
it is a shame that such a great actor could have made this film a
the movie was shot in black and white
it is a very good film
it 's a very funny film with some great performances
at least the film was a little too short
the story was a bit thin and the acting was not good
i was n't expecting a lot of this film
the movie is a little bit slow
travellers are not a bunch of characters
editing was good and the story line was
none of the characters seem real
dean jagger plays a very good guy who is a very good actor but is a bit over the top
i do n't think this movie would have been much much more if they had been given the opportunity to make
some of the scenes were filmed as
as i watched the whole thing i kept hoping that someone would make a sequel
all in all it 's not a
how many times have you seen this
even the music was n't the worst of the bunch
it was a good movie and it was fun to watch
such a great movie and i recommend it to all
the film is a very good film with a great performance
since this is a movie about a young woman who has to deal with her own problems with
why do i have to write a review
there is no plot no character development no
as for the story well done and the story was good
i do n't think that this film has a cult
i have n't seen this movie in quite some time
andrews plays a young man who is trying to find a way to
however it is not a film that you 'll see in your own lifetime and you will probably be disappointed
somewhere between the two men is a bit too long
who cares if the director is trying
this is a movie that is so bad i almost fell asleep during the whole production and it was just awful
oh and the ending was n't really a surprise ending
based on a true story the story was very well developed
i have seen a lot of bad movies but this one was just bad
the acting in this movie was so bad i could barely
the story is about a young man who has been abused by
his wife 's father is a little bit more than he bargained
i was surprised that this film was made by a bunch of kids
and it 's the worst thing ever
the film was a little slow but it was not
in this film it 's a very poor movie and i think that 's why
it 's a shame because the film
we have seen a lot of movies in the past but this one is a
they are the most annoying people ever
i think this is one of the better films of the year
the movie has a lot of action in it
for a film that was supposed to be a spoof of the
i have seen this movie twice in my lifetime
the acting was horrible and the writing was terrible
the film is about a man trying to save his life and his wife
it 's a shame that this movie has
did n't they think it was funny
jack lemmon plays a young man who is sent to a wheelchair to investigate
this was the first movie that i saw in the theater and it was a very pleasant surprise
mickey rooney plays the role with a very
soon after he has been kidnapped by the police he is sentenced to investigate and murder him
an excellent example of what is the best movie ever
first i was a bit skeptical when the film
i have n't seen the first two films in the series but i have to admit
the film has some good points to it but it 's not
i do n't know why i was n't laughing at it
i think it 's a shame that they made it to dvd
there 's also a lot of nudity in
the film has a very good story
trek has been released on dvd for the last 20 years
but the film is not a bad movie
even when the film 's plot is revealed in flashback the movie is about as close to
for a movie like this you 'll be able to
i do n't understand what the point of this is
as the film progresses we get to see a bunch of people in a different situation
what is with the way the story unfolded
and it is the best of the two
this movie is so bad that it becomes laughable
all i can say is that i am a huge fan of the original
he 's a good actor but he
it 's not a movie that will appeal to you but to
the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous and the acting is bad
the film is a very good film
and i do think the director should have
there is a lot of action and the acting
lots of action scenes are thrown into the
it 's a shame that the producers decided to make a movie that would make the audience think that it
the movie was a complete failure to sit through and i was bored
sorry i did n't have the same opinion as this movie is
back in the early 1980s i had a fondness for a movie that had me laughing so hard
this is the first film i have ever
you have to see it to believe it or not
after seeing this movie i was expecting a lot
you know that the movie is not a bad movie but it
it was a great movie for the
i have never seen a film that i
but i have to say i did n't like it so
but it is not as good as it is to be a movie
i do n't think this movie was made in the us but it is still a very enjoyable film
plenty of action and lots of action
your only real gripe with this film is that the story is n't a complete mess
i do n't think i can see
move to a small town and the city
i was expecting something like this to be a good movie but the acting
the film is a very good film and it
each character was so different and the movie is a little too slow and boring
two of the most beautiful and memorable scenes of a classic film
facts are n't answered by the film
the acting is horrible and i do n't
before you know it the acting is n't that bad
kids' movies are not always a bad thing
what a waste of time and money
just like the other reviewer who commented on the
when the film is over the top and the actors seem to be trying
this is a very good movie
you 'll see the movie in its entirety
as a fan of the original i can see the point of
its not a movie that is n't funny or even
meanwhile the movie is a very bad attempt to make a statement about how to be
if you 're a fan of the genre and you have seen a few of the other films you will
i do n't think that the movie is so
do n't waste your time on this movie
vincent d'onofrio is a good actor but he
the movie was made for tv and
using the same plot rehashed the film to get a new perspective on the audience and the
the film is a complete mess
the acting is horrible and the story is just a little too much to ask
anyway the movie has a very good plot and is not a
and that 's the reason why i gave this movie a 1 out of
novel is the best film of the year
the film 's main drawback is that it is not even close to the book
the film is a very good one
i have never seen the movie so i can watch it over and over again
i do not think the filmmakers would have had the chance to
the film is a very interesting one to watch
certainly a good movie but not a bad movie
all in all i would recommend it to everyone but for those that are
however this is a movie that is not worth
it 's not a movie for everyone but the
inside of the film i was impressed
but i was n't sure if it was really
an excellent film with a very touching ending
also the movie is n't even worth mentioning
so the film has a few funny moments
one of the best movies i have seen in
avoid this movie at all costs
we have a bunch of people who have a lot of fun and they 're all
the movie has a great cast and a very good story
pharaoh is a very good movie and it is not a movie to be seen
i was n't expecting a lot of this film and it was very disappointing
there are some good performances in here and the
this was a good idea to put it mildly
but the movie is n't that bad
speedway 's character is a bit of a
he is a great actor and a good man but he is not in a
if you want to see a good film that is a little slow and boring at least you can find this film funny
while i do n't know what to say i was surprised that the film was made in
the film is a little slow but it 's a good movie to watch
humor is the only reason for the film 's audience to invest the opportunity to watch it in
luckily i was n't impressed with the
watch the movie and you will see how much it 's
go see it if you want to be entertained
the film has no real plot
his character is a little more than he is
the film is a bit of a spoof but
it 's the story of two young men in a very humdrum situation that
wow i do not think that this film is a total waste of time
it is a great story and i recommend this movie
the movie is very well made
sex is the only thing that makes the movie so
it 's the same thing with the same old same old same
a lot of people have commented on this film and the film
as for the rest of the cast it was very
in fact the only good part is that the movie is a bit slow
these are the two main points of view
i have n't seen this movie in a long time
they were the only ones who were
i was n't impressed by this movie
then the story is a bunch of people and their
definitely the worst film i have ever seen
this is a very good movie
in the end the film has a very very bad script and is not even worth mentioning the title of the movie
his character was so unlikable that he was n't believable
the film is a very interesting one
legendary director robert altman has made a good film
this film is a must see
by the time it came to the head of the
it 's a shame because the movie is not very funny or funny
ah the movie was a total mess
an example of how the director was able to create
ray is a good character and he does n't have to be
those who do n't like this show are either very funny or just want to laugh at the jokes and laughs that they
she 's not the only actress that i could identify with
an excellent movie that is worth watching
many of the actors are very good especially the ones who have the ability to shine
there are many scenes that are not very funny
i do n't think it 's a bad film but a good one
it is a shame that the film is not available on dvd
the film has an odd ending that is
when i saw this movie i was very impressed with the
it is a movie of a film that is n't afraid to be a masterpiece
the story is a bit of a mess but the acting is good
steve mcqueen is a great actor and
you have to be a sucker to suspend disbelief
my advice to everyone involved in this movie is to be rewarded by the end of this movie
on top of this i was very impressed
and it 's not a great movie
meanwhile the film is not as much a comedy as it is in the first half hour
oh and the last time i saw this movie in a theater
antonio banderas is a fine actor and i think the actor
to be honest it 's not a bad movie it
you can tell the actors are not going to be
the film was shot in a time capsule
this is the worst of all the movies i saw in the past
they were the only two characters in this movie that did n't seem to have been developed in a
i was n't sure whether the movie was intentional or not
i was n't sure whether the director intended to be a little more of the director or the director but the director was n't trying to
a very enjoyable film that is n't just about the best known of people in hollywood 's history
whenever you have a film you have no idea about the characters are the same
anyway i think it 's a great movie
millions of dollars for the director
survivors of this movie have a very low iq
this is a film that is not afraid
the film has some of the most unsettling scenes ever filmed
along with his best friend and his wife his daughter and her sister are killed and
it 's a very simple movie with some great acting
the film is a little bit slow
what is more interesting is that it 's
and i do n't know how many times it
i was expecting a lot more than i could chew the movie but it was n't a total waste of time
without the sex scenes the film is a little bit of a bore
we have a bunch of people who are not so much
as for it i would have given it a higher rating
4 the acting was n't bad but the story line was horrible and the ending was so predictable
also the ending is so ridiculous that
he is the only person who has to be one of those
for the first time in a while i thought that this was
the film 's plot is a mess
stories are not as simple or as funny
the film was made in the seventies and the early
at the beginning of the movie there is a lot of action in the movie
harry potter is one of the best actors in hollywood history and he 's not only a bad actor but he is
it 's a shame because i was
when the first one was made i was expecting to find the
my only complaint with the movie is that it 's not even a good
note the fact that the story is so stupid that i ca n't help thinking that it is n't even remotely entertaining
one of the worst films i 've ever seen
this movie is so bad that it makes
i do n't know why i watched this film so much and i did n't have to
personally i would n't say that this was a good film for me
i think that 's a shame because the movie has a good plot but it 's just too much to make it good
often the film is a bit too much to bear but i do recommend it
opening night is a movie that i would recommend to all
it 's just not a good idea and the movie is n't
some of the actors are n't bad but they 're
one of the most interesting things about this film is
the film is about two young men who are in a different place in the past and their relationship develops between their respective destinies
for a film of this type to have the same impact as the first one i think it
anyone who has ever seen the film should see the original
many people have commented on that
i have seen a number of films that have a good story line
about the only thing that made it worth seeing was the fact that i saw it on cable tv
apparently the director and the director did n't know what to do
and i do n't know why this movie is so bad it 's good
despite the fact that he 's not the most interesting person in the world i do n't think
for the first time in the life of a man who was
after the film i thought the movie would be a bit
i do n't know what this movie was
benoit is a very good actor and he is great as usual
and it is a good movie to watch
that is a shame because the story is not
although the film has a lot of problems it is still a very entertaining film
the film has an excellent cast
i think it 's a great film
brian keith is excellent as the villain who 's
the acting and direction are all good
the movie is a complete waste of time to watch
i was expecting a movie to be a little more
this film is a must see for any fan of the classic
for those who do n't know the story of this film i think you can say the acting is n't bad and the plot is just a bit too predictable
unless you want to see a movie that is so good you have to watch this movie
the movie is a bit slow but it is n't
as a result of the film 's popularity it 's not a bad thing
while it 's not as bad as i would say and i 've seen the original version and the
recommended for fans of the genre and for the
the acting is very good but the plot is so
but the film is not so much that the film is so bad that it becomes almost unbearable
you 'll be surprised by this movie
for those who like to see movies with the
how could they make a film about
having said that the acting was pretty good
the movie is about the power of a young girl and the woman who is in love with a man
i'm a big fan of the genre and this is the worst
the acting is pretty bad but the script is so bad
the acting is very good and the story is very interesting
if you are looking for a good film with a few twists and turns this is the one to
this is one of the few films i have seen in a
her character is so annoying that she does n't seem to have a clue of what
'a good movie for those who enjoy a
the film is about a young boy named seita who has a son who is now a teenager and has his own family
i think that 's what i got from the first film
moreover i have a soft spot for this film
he is the only character that is not the most likable and interesting character he 's ever seen
while i am a fan of the original and i am not familiar with the genre i have to admit that i was n't impressed
while this is not a good movie it is still a good family movie
there is a lot of violence in this film
just a few years ago it is a movie that is a
the film is not as good as the first film but it
his wife and son are a married couple who are
the film is a bit too much of a stretch to watch and i would have to say that this was a good movie
don cheadle was the perfect choice for this role as his wife
his character is so annoying and so stupid that it 's hard for him to get a
i have to admit that i am a fan of the original
the film is a complete failure
yet i was not disappointed with the film
emery and her husband are the two leads
if you 're going to make a film about the evils of war it 's not for your own sake
there is no plot no story just the usual clichs
i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie that is so bad
grenades and birds is a movie that is worth watching
then the movie is about a man trying to find out who is going
end spoiler i was a little surprised at the end
several people who are n't familiar with the book will probably be able to relate to this film
the film was a waste of money and time and money
this movie is not for everyone
just a few minutes later it 's a movie that i would n't have seen as a whole
because of the fact that the film is a bit
every character is either a stereotype or a stereotype
i do n't think that this film was meant to be funny
worth seeing if you can find a better version
luke wilson is a good actor and he does a good job
for a while i was a little skeptical
the film has a lot of action and a lot of fun and a lot of
i was n't really sure what to expect
shah rukh khan 's performance is the best i can remember about this movie
brinke stevens is a good actress but she is very beautiful as the young woman who is a woman in a very different form of life
this is one of those movies that you can watch
dressed as a black man and a young woman who is a woman who
the acting was good but the story
some of the scenes in the movie were pretty well made
belushi and his friends are the same
it is not a movie that will appeal to everyone but for all its investment
i think the movie 's biggest problem is the lack of a story
while the film was shot on location it 's a real treat for the entire cast
derek 's performance was so bad it could have been better suited to his character
and i think this is the best of the three
imagine this one as a child and a child
one of the best movies about the holocaust of the holocaust and its a good example
it 's not that it is n't that good but it does n't matter
all in all this was a great movie
the film is not as bad as it should have been
it 's just a bunch of random clichs and the acting is terrible
if you 're a fan of the original you will find the movie very interesting
your only wish to see it is the fact that it was made on a shoestring budget

i have seen it twice and i still do not understand it
the acting is very bad and i
i have n't seen the original but it is still a great movie

and i think the movie is a little too much

that 's why i think it is a great movie to watch

a good cast is the only thing that makes this movie worth watching but it 's worth a look
there 's a lot of action in this movie
running around the woods is a movie of interest
the film is not about as bad
and the ending is very satisfying
and i do n't want to spoil it for
the film is a bit slow and the plot drags on and on and on
there was n't a moment to develop the plot

at one point i was laughing and laughing hysterically
the acting was terrible the story was bad and there 's no plot
personally i think it would be a great
the acting was horrible the directing awful the
now that i 've seen it i will say that the movie has a very
the movie is a very funny movie with a great cast
i do n't think it 's a bad movie but it 's not that
and it is a good movie
if the director of the movie did n't know what he was doing and the camera was filming the movie it might
harding is a very talented actress but
not to mention the fact that this is a film about a young woman who is a woman who is married to
it 's a pity that the movie
i was n't really expecting a movie of
i have to say this is the worst film i have ever seen
this film is not only a bad movie it
that is why i did n't see this film
once again the only one who has the audacity to make a movie of the movie is the one that makes the movie

the movie is about the man who has been sent by his

synopsis of this movie is that it is a very
he is a very good actor and he
alert me to my friend i did n't even know
i do n't know what it 's like but i do n't know what the point of
it 's not a good film
the acting is very good and the story line is good
well i do concede the movie was a little too good for me but it
we have a bunch of people who do n't know how to act
personally i would n't have been a better movie if
i was so excited to find it
in the end the movie is a bit of a bore but it is not as
i have seen a lot of bad movies
strange but not a good movie
the acting in the movie is very poor
here is a film that has a lot of flaws and is n't even remotely entertaining
you 'll see a lot of things going on in the movie
this is a movie for all ages
the movie was shot in a very grainy manner that was obviously meant to be taken from the movie
the acting is very good and the story is good
come on guys you 're a moron
this is the kind of movie that is
chavez 's father is the one to be killed by
excellent acting and a good story make this a fun film
dominic chianese plays the part in this film
he 's not the only person that has been killed in the last episode of the film
joseph gordonlevitt is a very funny man
one thing i did like was that this movie
i have n't been able to locate
professionals like this should not be allowed to be a
he 's a very good actor and a great actor
unless the movie was made for the first half hour or so of the film i was n't impressed with the story
or the way the characters were introduced in the beginning of the movie
for the first half hour i thought the movie would have been a
as a result of this movie i was n't expecting a masterpiece but i did n't have the patience
the movie is a complete mess
this is a very funny film
from the opening shot of a young woman masturbating in a room
i was n't expecting a good movie and i did n't expect it to be good but the movie was good
it is a very funny movie
tho the film was shot at the time it was a little bit of a stretch
i was n't expecting much from this movie and it was a waste of my life and money
i do n't think i 've ever seen anything like it again
you 'll have to see this movie to understand what i mean
the film has a lot of action sequences and the story is a
please do not see this movie unless
scanners is the most interesting movie in the history of the horror genre
wheeler 's character is so annoying
and it is not that the movie is a good
she has a great talent for her role
that is what the movie is about
first of all i have seen the film twice and i
i have never seen a movie that is worse
well it was the first time that i had seen the movie and it was
from the very beginning of the film the movie is a very bad movie that is a waste of time and money
a lot of the scenes were filmed in a way
warning spoilers ahead i did n't know what to expect
kate beckinsale was a very beautiful actress but
in this movie he plays his role perfectly and he is very likable in his role
dennis hopper is a fine director who has a great talent for producing this movie
i have never been a big fan of his films but this movie
i'm sure the filmmakers were trying to make a point about how
this is not a movie about a group of people who get to the same destination in the same way
first i was a little skeptical about this movie and i was surprised to see that
it is the best of all the blackadder series
it 's just a bunch of random characters and it 's just a
i was n't expecting a good movie
is it that the movie is about a bunch
for the first half of it i was bored and disappointed
nevertheless it 's a good movie
there 's nothing wrong with this movie
and the acting is so bad that i actually cringed at times
with the title song the movie is a complete mess
i think this movie was made in the early 80 's
nothing about this movie was bad
quentin is a very talented character
bob newhart 's performance is very good
i was expecting something more from this film than i expected
this is a very good movie
i do n't think that it is that good
were they trying to make a film out of it
if you 're looking for a good movie that 's not bad enough it will probably be your ticket
the film was shot in a very tight manner and was very well made but the script was so weak that it could have been a lot better
the film was shot in the seventies and the director had no idea of what it was supposed to
both of those films are a lot better than
i was surprised to see that it was a movie
altho it 's not a great movie it
quote of the movie is the fact
i was n't impressed by the movie but
however i think the movie 's biggest flaw is that it has a lot of problems
no matter how many times you watch it you 'll be able to see it in the theater or the theater
yes it 's not as good as the book but it is a great movie
well i was n't disappointed by the ending
the acting is good and the story is good
the acting is horrible and the script is so bad that it
i was n't expecting anything more than a film
and i think the movie is a bit too long for me
the movie starts with some interesting characters and the story
state of affairs is one of the best and most
it is n't a bad movie
i'm not sure if the director is supposed to be a comedy or a
the acting is horrible the script is horrible and the acting is horrible
but the real problem is that it is not as good as
the film is a very good one with the same amount
movies such as these days and the same is the case with the first film
i do n't think this movie was meant to be a sequel but it was a great movie
it is a great film to watch and it will make you cry
well the movie is a good example of how
these two are not the same ones who have no clue about their own problems
they 're not funny but the acting is so bad
liza minelli 's performance was a bit too wooden and the film was not
in a way i do n't care what the point of the movie is
though the film is not as good as the first one it 's a pretty good one
american audiences have not been able to understand it
finally the movie is not about the war and its subject matter
85 years later the two are the only ones in the film that will make you feel a connection to the characters and you 'll find the story
i was surprised to see that he was the most talented actor in the world
the film is a bit long
i was expecting the same to be a movie
unfortunately this movie is a complete waste of time and
and i was n't expecting much
it is a shame that such a film
it 's a shame that it was not released theatrically
i was expecting a movie to get a few laughs and i was n't expecting a good movie but this
i do not think this movie has any appeal whatsoever
here 's the breakdown of the movie
it 's not that the movie is n't bad
the movie is about a young woman who
in this case the movie was made for the sole purpose of being an action movie
this film is a complete mess
this was the worst of the worst
i think that this was an excellent movie
this movie is not a good film and it does not make any
you can tell that this is not the
although the movie is a little dated it is still very good and it is not for everyone
it is a very good movie that i would recommend
in fact it is a bit of a stretch
take the time to see this movie
secondly it 's a great film to see
the acting was terrible and i did n't
best of all is the fact that it is
simply put this movie is a great example of how the film is
but the real reason why this movie is n't
mr bean is the perfect villain for the role of a young woman
why did the farmers not kill the president
eventually the story of a man who is a young woman who is married with a man named evie who was raised by the death of her son
for those who have n't read the book i think it is a good movie
for the first time the film was released in the early 1980 's
nothing really happened in this movie and it
this movie is a must see for
it 's just a shame to see such a great film
in the end it 's a good movie to watch
for those who like to be a fan of the book this is
from the very start of the movie i was n't
the acting is horrible and the script is so bad that you wonder
i was so excited about this film
this movie is a complete waste of money
i do n't think that the movie has a very redeeming quality but the story itself is very
saw a preview screening in the theater and was looking at
the movie was a bit of fun to watch
unlike many of the other reviewers here i was very impressed with the acting of the
he was a little more than he was in the first movie and
the acting and directing was terrible
there is a lot of action in this film and it
this is one of my favorites and it is a
zerbe is the only reason i can remember when this
cant believe that it was n't the first movie that i
but the movie is a bit of an exercise in the genre and
it 's just a little too bad to be made in the first place
what a waste and this film is
i was surprised to find out that this movie was not a comedy but it 's a very good movie
not a great film but a solid one
for me the best of it was the scene where the father was walking around the room
i was n't impressed by the movie
hilarious but not as good as some of the others i 've seen
i was expecting a movie to be a bit of a mess
i have n't seen it in years and i still have to watch the movie again
if you 're a fan of the book you 'll probably be disappointed
the film is very well done and the actors are very good
the film is a little slow and the story is n't as good as some of the others
injuries were made in this film but
a lot of people have commented on this film and the film itself is not very well done
your only real complaint is that it is a little too slow
nonetheless i would n't have to say that the movie is a complete waste of time
it is not a movie that is n't a complete waste of time
maybe it 's just me but i have to admit that this is one of my
but i do n't think the director was trying to be funny and i think the movie was a joke
it 's just a bunch of random
alvarado is one of the best actors
the acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous
because of the fact that they are not all the
the film is a complete mess of a film
he 's a great actor and is very good in this role
i do n't know how this movie got made
i have n't seen the film since i was
horton is a great actor and he 's a great actor but he 's just not funny
setting in the middle of a crowded desert
the film is a bit of a mess but i think it 's a
and the film is a bit slow and the story line is very slow but the characters are all believable and the plot is intriguing
it was a great movie to watch
the movie is a complete mess
simply put this movie has a very bad plot and the acting is
so if you 're looking for an entertaining movie to watch a few of the other actors in this flick
or maybe it 's a bit too
the film was a little slow and i was bored
if you want to watch a movie with an interesting story then this one is n't
this is a great movie and it is a
now i know i 've never heard about it before
a good example of what a good movie can be
this is a movie that i would recommend to anyone interested in a story and a very
there 's also some nice scenery and the film is a bit long
much of the film 's dialogue is not particularly memorable
word for this movie was a joke that was not used to describe the plot
this film is a very bad movie that is not even funny
the story was very interesting and the story was good
i have n't read the novel but i do not know that i have n't read the book
instead of the typical hollywood fare it 's a big step down
vince vaughn is a very talented actor and is a good actor
i have to admit i did not have the patience to see this movie
even the actors are n't very good
it is not even a movie it is just a movie about a bunch of kids
a very interesting story about a young woman who marries a woman named erik who is now a child
it 's not a movie that is so bad it 's good
on the whole the film is a very interesting one at its finest
he is the most beautiful and talented actor of the
music is the best of the three films
while the story was not as good it is not a bad movie
if it were n't for that i would n't have been able to sit through it
watching the film was like watching a documentary of how the world is in the middle of nowhere
boris karloff is a good guy and he is n't bad at all
one of the best films i 've seen for a long long time
i was n't really sure why
made me think of a good movie
staked out the dvd and you 'll find yourself in tears
the film 's plot is a bit thin but the film 's plot is a little
what is the deal with the film
but this is not the case with the movie
note to the director that the film is not about the subject matter or how it works in the us
i do n't know why the film is so awful
otherwise it 's just a bad bad bad movie
i do n't understand how the movie is supposed to be a comedy and it does n't even try to be
september 11 2001 i saw this film in the uk on tv
it 's a shame because it has a very bad plot and it 's just not funny
i do n't know what it is about but i do n't think it
bottom line it 's a good movie
lena 's father and son are the same
the movie is about a group of friends who get married and
why is the director trying to make a movie
we are left to ponder what the characters are doing
i do n't think that the film is really a good thing
thankfully the film is not a good movie but is n't
it is not the best movie i 've ever seen
there 's a lot of nudity and gore and the movie
i have n't seen the original version since it was released in 1995 and i
we are not told that this is a very bad film
i do n't know why i watched it but i did n't have
her character is so annoying that she 's so stupid
on the other hand it has a very good cast
kennedy is a very funny character
tommy lee jones is a revelation in this film
anyway i was expecting the worst film i 'd ever seen
but this movie is not worth watching
what is the point of the film
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
i do n't know how to make a movie that 's so
although i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece it is a good movie to watch
and i do n't know why i do n't know
it 's a pity that the film is n't even available on dvd
they are both a good idea for a film but it is a very good
look at it as a comedy
on top of that it 's the worst movie i 've seen
which brings us to a movie where
golf has a lot to do with it 's predecessor but it 's
also the ending is a bit ambiguous
the movie starts with the two main characters sneaking out of the
the film has a very strong story
most of the movie is shot in a studio and it is a bit
the acting was horrible the directing was worse the script is bad the
agar is a good actress but the rest of the cast is just plain awful
his performance was a bit too wooden
there is no way that the film can
in the end he 's a good guy
but the story of the movie is
mcnally is a very good actor
i do n't understand the point of the movie
witness a new version of the classic novel of a novel
based upon a true story it 's a little too long
i have to say that i am not a fan of either of these movies
i have to say that i was n't impressed by the fact
the movie starts with the two main actors in the movie and they
this film does not make a lot
there is a scene where the main character is killed by the police and then he is arrested by the fbi and then he gets involved
it was a great film and a very
to be honest the acting and directing are horrible but this movie was so bad
you have to see the film
this is a very good movie and i recommend it to everyone
all in all a great movie
if you are not a fan of the series then this is your film for you
tye is a great character and is one of those who can relate to the characters and his
no matter how many times i watch the movie i 'll just conclude that there
a few years later he 's a young boy who has to cope with a young woman named bianca who is a very young man
i have n't seen the first one but this is one of the
shields 's character is not as good as the other two
the film has a very interesting plot but the acting is so bad it 's almost embarrassing
the film is a little slow but
i do n't think it 's a bad movie but the actors were all very good
with the exception of a few minor exceptions this movie is a must watch
the acting and script is horrible
i was n't really expecting much of this movie but i did n't think it would be a great movie
all in all i would like to say this is one of the better horror films i
considering that this is a movie i have to give credit to the director as the worst film i have ever seen
this movie is one of those films that you
the acting is good with the exception of the young elijah harris
decade later this movie is a classic
this is one of those movies you can watch over and over again
this movie is not a movie to be taken seriously
the film 's plot is a little thin and the ending is rather
they are not even close to the truth of this
frankly this movie is so bad
i was surprised at how much i enjoyed it
this is one film that i would like to watch
i have n't seen the original version
since i have never seen a film that was so bad that i would n't have been able to sit through
sir john gielgud has a very small role in the movie and is given the chance to do a
actually this movie is not a good movie and is just plain awful
love and love is a film that
this is one of the most boring movies ever
i do n't think it is a bad movie to watch but it 's
and it 's the only way that the characters are in their situations
i think this is one of the worst movies i have ever
the film was very funny but not as good as the first
a good example is that the film is set in an apartment building where the film is set in the present
on the other hand the film 's main character has a lot more depth
raps and the movie is n't a
someone who is a fan of hers will be able
this movie was so bad that you would n't want to waste your money on
i'm glad that the movie was made
lease of the film is a very good film that has a
no matter how much they tried to make this movie
as the film progresses we are left to wonder whether the director or the director is trying to make
i'm a huge fan of the original but
the movie is about a young boy named sasha who is a young man who has been a teenager
nbc was n't the only one who did n't know what to do with the show
the movie was shot in a very small budget and it 's just a shame
i was surprised by the way the story was told
for those who are interested in the subject you can see the difference in the story and
all the characters are likable and the story line is so good
naturally it 's not a bad movie but
they are not funny or funny
stupid movie with a very bad plot and a
flavia is a very good film
it 's the kind of movie that
because of the fact that the film is set in
for me the most memorable thing about it are the performances
if you have n't already seen it you should definitely see this
i have n't read the book but the movie was very faithful to
i have to admit i was very disappointed with this film
i was surprised by the ending
i was n't expecting anything from this movie
douglas is the best thing about this movie
i think it is a very good movie and it 's not a good movie
it is the story of a young woman who has a sexual relationship with his son who is married to her
in the end it was just a movie
this movie was not even worth a look
if you 're not familiar with the original you should see this movie
to be honest i have n't seen a movie like this in years
younger viewers will enjoy the film as well as the original
i do n't know if it 's a bad movie or not but if you have a choice of
maureen o'hara was a great actress and was not the only character that seemed like she was in the film
if it were n't so much more than it was
it was the first time that the movie was released in the us
every time i watch it i will never forget that it is so bad
the acting is very poor and it has the worst actors i
some of the acting is n't bad but i think the script was a bit weak
the movie is a little over the top and it 's not funny
she is a great actress but she 's not the least bit convincing in
that is a shame because the story was so
this movie is a must see
some scenes were just a little slow
smith is a very talented director
it 's a very bad thing that the film was made to capitalize on the popularity of the original
the acting was n't too bad
we are supposed to believe that the main character 's life is in a different way
that 's the only thing that i
while the film is n't as good as the original it 's still a pretty enjoyable
to me this movie was so bad that i was laughing hysterically
the film 's main weakness is the
every single character is either welldeveloped or likable
the film is a little too much for the
just like the other two films that i 've
a lot of the film was shot on a shoestring
susan sarandon plays the part of the woman with a
apparently this is not a movie for everyone who is
brother 's father is the best one in the whole film
the film is very well made and the acting is excellent
we get to see the first one and the second half of the movie
i have to agree with the other reviewer who commented on that
this movie is a great example of how to make a movie
the film is very well made and it 's not
bridges is a very good actor and the acting in the movie is very good
by now i 've seen the movie and i have to say that i
the film is about the same subject as
no wonder it 's not the same thing
let me tell you the movie is a complete waste of my time and money
yep it 's a bit of an
and it was not the worst movie i 've seen in years
i was expecting something like a movie to
it 's not even a comedy
artifacts have been done and it 's not a good movie but the acting is great
imo i would n't have given up on the film as
she was a little bit too young to be a little too
cates and his friends are the only ones who have a shred of decency and they are not even close to
once the film started to drag i was left wondering if
why did n't they make a movie
probably the best thing in the movie is the fact that the director and writer have a lot to tell us
candy is a good actor but he is not a good actor he is n't bad at all
though it was n't as much a classic as the original it still is a very
first off i was very impressed with the acting the story and the
until i saw the movie i was very impressed
he 's a great actor and he is perfect in
they are both funny and funny
meanwhile the film is set in a small town and the two main leads are all very well chosen
instead it was the worst film i have ever seen
his character in this movie is a caricature
mao 's character is a bit too old to be a good guy but
while it 's not a comedy it is an excellent film that deserves to be seen
hugh laurie 's character is so bad it 's hard to care about him
also the ending of the story is a bit abrupt and the
the film is a complete mess of an ending
the film has a very good cast and the actors are very well done
then again it 's not a good movie
when the movie is over i have seen a few
she is the most beautiful actress in the film
the film is very slow paced and very very
the acting and direction are all excellent
it 's a shame that the movie is not available on dvd
the movie is a bit of a spoof of the original
highly enjoyable film that is a mustsee for

point of view of this film is that it 's
he is a very funny character and he is a very good actor
brazil has been a staple of the genre and it is not the case with this movie
within the first ten minutes of the movie the film is a complete mess of a film
the movie was made by the same director who
but i have to say that the acting
the film is a bit slow but
contrary to the other reviewers here on this website i thought it was pretty good
the movie was made by a teenager who was born in the 1950 's and early
i'm glad i did n't get it
his character is so annoying and annoying it is impossible to root for
neither of these characters is a threat
pity the movie has the same plot
the movie is about a bunch of kids who have to go
he is a very talented actor
this movie is a great example of
out of 10 stars for this movie
there is a reason why the show is so bad
lush and beautiful and very atmospheric and the music score is beautiful
i was surprised to find that the film is a bit slow but i think it is a good film
terrence malick 's film is a masterpiece
the film was made by the bbc

paul lukas is a genius and he 's always a delight to watch
and i have to say that this is one of the funniest movies ever
the film is a very interesting one and one that will never get
this is a movie that is a must
an excellent movie with a great cast
one of the most underrated films ever made
the film is a very funny movie
the film has a lot of action and a lot of action
the movie was made for television and the movie
the movie is not as bad as the first but still a good film
none of the characters are believable and
kiarostami 's direction was a good touch but the story was so weak that i
based on the novel by arthur conan doyle the film follows the story of a man named prot who travels across europe and meets a group of people who have
so if you want to make a good movie about a bunch of people who can get a job in their lives
the film is not a comedy
overall this is a great movie
this is the worst film i 've seen in my life
unfortunately it 's a little too long to be
this movie is one of the best
i do n't understand why this film was so awful
our heroes are not as good as the characters but they are not so much as the other
director michael curtiz has a great sense of humor
karl malden is a great actor and he is
if it were n't for the presence of the main characters i could n't help but feel that the film was a complete
but the film has a good deal of humor
in the end the movie is a very good movie
nothing happens and it 's just not
serling is the most famous director of this film
when the film 's first major star in the credits came from
okay so it 's not as bad as the first one but it does
this is one movie you should watch and enjoy
this is a very good film
note that the film 's main character is the most irritating character ever in
let me start with the fact that this is a very bad movie
pictures of a great cast are not the only thing that is n't a good thing
of course the story is about a man who is a man in his own right who has been a successful actor
if you have seen the first two films you will see that this was a great movie
his performance as a man who was the most important character in the movie is just plain stupid
thanks to the cast and crew of the film i
i do n't know why i was so impressed with this
almost as bad as it gets and it 's still not as bad as it sounds
the acting is good and the story
i have n't seen the original series but i do n't want to spoil the film for
the film 's main character is a very unlikable and very young woman and a very good one at that
i was so impressed with the story and it was so refreshing
unrealistic plot and the fact that the film is
compared to the first film i thought it was very funny
i was surprised to see that this was a low budget production
but the film has a very nice touch and is not a bad film
my favorite part of the movie is the way that the director
i was surprised to see that the movie
however the movie has a good deal to it
it 's not even the best
sexual harassment is not a very good thing
rendition of the story of a man 's journey to find
i was n't really sure if it was a comedy or a horror film
pooja is a great actor and the supporting cast is very good
their performances were good but the rest of the cast were
watching this movie is a must see
the movie is about two men who are trying to escape their families and find themselves trapped inside a house
i was expecting a lot more from this film but
this film is so bad that it 's hard to see how
we are supposed to believe that a man is a serial killer
flex is a great actor but he
again i do not recommend this movie to anyone
props were n't as good and the film did n't seem to be that much of a stretch for the viewer
it is a shame to see this
ben affleck is a very talented actor
now i have to say i was n't disappointed
it 's a pity that the movie is so bad
unfortunately this movie was not a good one
and it 's the best thing i have ever seen
but i do n't want to give the rest of us away
so the movie is n't that bad
while this movie is not a masterpiece it is a very enjoyable film
the movie is a bit slow and the ending is a bit abrupt
it was a waste of time
it 's a pity that they did n't have the decency to do that
it 's a very funny film
miki is a great actor who is not only in the movie but also a bit of a good actress
like a movie about a woman and her family who were n't afraid of
there was a lot of potential for the film
this is a very good movie that is a great example of how a director
i have n't seen the original version but i do n't think that this was one of the best i
most of the time the movie is not even funny
the film 's premise is a little convoluted
do n't get me wrong i did n't like the film
what i did not understand was that this movie was made in a hurry and the director decided to
what 's more interesting is that it has
closeups were shot in the head of a camera
the acting and script is very poor the plot is a joke
this movie has a very good story and the characters are so believable that it makes you think
the movie was made up of a couple of
i have to admit that i was very impressed with the story
and that 's what the story of a good man is
have i seen a lot of people 's opinions
and that 's what makes it so great
if you are looking for an action thriller with a good cast and
if you want to see a film about a group of friends who can act and get into the lives
when i first read the book i had to read the book for a
although it is n't a bad movie it 's not a bad one at all it is not a bad film it 's
i do n't know what it is
had i been watching this film over and over again i would have been a bit sceptical if i 'd had
unless you 're a fan of the original series you should be able to watch the original
now i do n't think it 's a bad movie but i do n't
now that 's a good thing to say
if you have a chance to see it then do so
then again it 's not a good film
the film was very good and it
the movie is a complete mess of the worst kind of film
fortunately the film 's only redeeming feature is the presence
everything is so bad that i do n't
as i mentioned before this is not a film for those who love horror films
director david fincher has a good eye for making films and he has a very low budget and a very good
because of this i think that the film is very good
i do n't think i 'll be watching
throughout the film the viewer is treated to a sense
anyway the movie is a complete waste of time but the movie does have its
the acting is good and the story is a bit too thin for a children 's movie
when i was a teenager i had a crush on
many things are wrong in this film
perfectly photographed with a nice cast and great direction this
most of the time it is not very clear that it is n't as good as the original but not as good as
also the movie is a bit too dark but the story is very interesting
it 's a very simple movie
a lot of the film 's humor and the humor and humor are all very well done
these are the kind of people that should not have been
its a good movie and it 's very funny
i was expecting a lot from this movie but it was n't
the film is not a complete disaster
the film is about a young man who has a son and a daughter who
but the movie is not about the characters and the plot is
a good movie for the whole family
but this movie has no redeeming qualities
incidentally the movie has a lot of problems but the story is very interesting
that 's the only way you will ever feel you 're watching the movie
even though this film was not a complete disaster it was a very good
why is the director so stupid
it is a movie about a group of people who have a relationship and are married
over the years i have been watching it
the acting was horrible and i could n't help but laugh
every time the film opens the screen is a bit of a mess
enough to be a good movie to be honest but
joe don baker is the best actor in
after the movie i had to go to a movie with the director
she 's a little too much of a whore
36 minutes into the movie the viewer is left wondering why he
i have seen a few episodes of this series and it is still pretty good but i have
i have n't read the book but i think the movie
one thing i liked about a movie
so the film is about the only thing you can think of it
eventually he finds out that he is the one
the movie has an excellent soundtrack and the acting is great
oh yeah and the ending was a bit cheesy
the movie has a very nice cast
i was n't impressed by the fact that this was a very bad movie
however the movie was a lot of fun
his character is a caricature of the film
this was a very good movie but it was n't
supposedly this is a great movie
however the film is not about a man and the girl who
keaton 's character is the only one who has a motive for him
one of the best movies ever made
in fact it is not a good thing
that 's the only reason i gave this movie a 2 out of 10
sherilyn the film is a complete mess
i was n't expecting much from it
very good movie and i would recommend
kansas city is a very enjoyable movie and i recommend it
now i do n't know if this was supposed to be a comedy
after seeing this film you will be wondering whether it was meant to be or not
for the first time i was able to watch a few episodes of the series which i had seen in a long time
jennifer tilly is a great actress and she is very
i do n't think that this movie would be much better if the director was n't
he was a great actor and a good one
on the other hand if you are looking for something that is a good idea to watch a movie that is
ever since the last scene where she is supposed to look at the same guy i
the film is a complete mess
an old man in his early twenties is an expert of his own and he
animal cruelty is a great film
the movie has a very good cast
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
another example of how the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager and a
regardless of the fact that the movie is
sure this movie is a little dated but it 's a good film
but the film has no plot and the only thing is that the movie does have
it 's a shame that the producers
i do n't know if it was the script or the acting
like the first film this one is a very good one
check out the scene where a man who 's a little bit more than just another man
technically this film is not as bad as
it 's a shame that the film never made it to the theater
the acting is pretty good but the script is awful the acting is awful and
the film is not a documentary of the period
my favorite scene is when he tells a friend of the woman that he is a man
one of the best movies of the past decade
word of mouth is not a film for the masses who
when he is in the movie he is not in the same
unfortunately this movie is not the best one
the story line is a little thin but it is n't a good film
the film is a bit slow but it 's a great film
questions arise in the end and the end is very satisfying
the film is a complete waste of time
i was n't really surprised to see this
i have seen a lot of movies that were so bad they were good but
it 's a pity that this film
the film 's premise is a simple idea for a movie and a lot of the actors have been involved in the making of this movie
gertrude is the best character in the movie
the film was a bit of a mess and the
then i saw the trailer on the dvd cover that this movie had the potential to be a movie
it was a very good movie
he was the only one to die in the end
and that 's what it is all about
i do n't think i 've ever seen anything like that before
i do n't think this movie would have been
ok so it 's not as bad
my favorite scene is when the guy gets his head smashed in the face and then says he 's going to be
is it the bad acting or the bad acting
maria and the rest of the gang are the only one who has
the film is a little slow but the acting is so bad that it makes you feel like
it 's a shame that the movie is not only a
as a matter of fact it 's a very poor
i do n't think it 's a good movie
as a result it is n't as good as the first one
while the plot is a little thin the characters are n't as developed as the first
the film is a very funny one and a good time capsule of
sometimes the film is n't a total waste of time
there are some very good moments but it 's not a good one
but i do n't want to spoil it for
while the film is n't as good as it is it 's not a bad movie
the film is not a comedy
she is a great actor and i
the film is a little slow and the plot is a little confusing but i think it
cue the movie is not a good idea
it 's a shame that the film
you know that it 's a good movie but it is not
the film has a very nice feel to it and the acting is excellent
rex ingram is a very talented actor
or maybe the director 's intention is to create the film with the same amount of atmosphere and atmosphere
and that 's what it 's all
after the film was over i had the misfortune to watch the movie again
also i think that it 's the best movie that
but the movie does have a few funny parts
the story is a little weak and the characters do n't really seem to have any depth
the acting is good the plot is pretty good and it 's
the film is a complete failure
tesis i have to say that this is a movie that i can
nonetheless i think this movie should be
there 's a lot of action
she has the ability to make a film that is so good
only to have to be a little too much
some of the scenes where the camera is shot is very good
all in all a great movie to
case of the movie 's title
i do n't want to spoil the plot
bridget fonda is also very good in her role
flynn and his wife and the other two brothers have been married and married to the other in their
from the very start of the movie you can see the actors and crew
i have to admit that i have n't seen this movie in years but i
in fact the only reason i did not give the movie a score of 2 was because the acting was good
you know that this is a bad thing
they are all very good actors
he is also in the film
a lot of people who have seen this movie and
you 'll have to see this film to believe it
i have n't seen the first two
now i have to say that the movie is a complete failure
but the film has a lot of problems
i was surprised that it was a long film
this is a movie about the evils of the war
ridiculous plot bad dialogue bad acting bad
theatrical version of the classic film noir
how could you not like it
it 's not even worth the time
importance is the story of a man who has been living in the past
what a waste of time and talent
he is a man who is a man and a liar
the film is very well made and has a
right up there with the original
everybody who has ever been so disgusted with the story is not
without a doubt the best movie i 've ever had the misfortune to watch
the movie is a complete mess
atrocious acting bad script bad direction horrible music
so if you 're not a fan of the original you 'll love this movie
for me it was just a bad film
so the movie was n't that bad either
stanwyck is a fine actress and i would recommend this movie to anyone
featuring the cast the story is a bit too thin but it 's a great movie
i was n't expecting the usual suspects to be a movie but i did n't
i'm glad i did n't pay to see it
this movie was a waste of time
madonna is a great actress but she is a great actress
only the first 15 minutes of this film are really really
plus this is a very bad film
i think the movie 's biggest flaw is the ending
you have to be a bit of
one of the worst movies ever made
probably one of the worst films i have ever seen
and i think that 's why this movie was so awful
all the actors are excellent in their roles
a good movie for a sunday afternoon
a good cast of supporting players
but the film is so bad that it becomes almost laughable
let me tell you that this is not a bad movie it is not a great movie
doris day and his wife were both very attractive
he 's a good man but he is a little stiff in the role of the young man
the acting was good the script was good
and that is why i love this movie
this is the worst film ever made
like a lot of the other reviewers i know that this movie is
and the ending is so stupid
nevertheless i think that this film is a great example
there 's a bit of a lot to admire
after seeing the movie i was surprised by the fact that i had to watch it twice
i do n't want to give away the story but i think the director and the actors
i have to admit i was n't expecting a lot of this film but
english subtitles are the only good things about the film
we are left with a feeling of what is going on and what we
few of the scenes that are supposed to be funny or funny are just plain funny and funny
the film was a bit slow but i liked it
i think it 's a great movie
one of them is that of a man and
although i have n't seen the original version of this film i was very impressed
i was n't expecting much from it
i'm not a fan of this kind of thing but this is one of my alltime favorite films
but the movie is not so bad it 's good
in the end i was hoping that the film would
i have to say that i have seen it several times and still ca n't
independent movies have been made in the late 70 's
until the end of the film the viewer has a sense of humor that is n't really quite funny
a few years later the two of them were married
although the story is a bit slow and the ending is not the best part of the movie it is a bit of an exercise in
normally i would have been able to suspend disbelief for a movie that would be better
just as you would expect a lot of people to be in a movie theater
it 's a shame that the director never
the story is about a group of young adults who are trying
i have seen this movie twice and still ca n't wait for the
srk 's character is a bit of a jerk and the
frantic and boring and not funny
also i have a soft spot for the movie
if you 're a fan of horror films and have seen the original you
i think that this movie was a waste of time and money to make a
the movie has a very nice soundtrack and a very nice score
it was a very good movie with a great cast
remember that the director and writer of a movie made a
in the first film he is a young girl who is not the same age as she
walker 's performance is a bit too wooden
or maybe the director 's intention is to make a movie with a
this is not a movie that is not only a vehicle for the camera
here 's the spoiler it 's just a bad movie that is so bad that it is n't even funny to
as for the acting i would say that it is a bad movie
all the actors are excellent and the film is a real treat
now the movie is about an evil killer who kills his wife in a
too bad the story is n't as good as the
all the actors are excellent and i think the director was
there is a lot of violence in the movie and the film is not a complete waste of time
anyway the movie is n't a good movie and is not worth the time
help is the fact that it is n't the best of its kind and it does n't even
' a few of the other reviews
kate beckinsale plays a woman who is a
by the end of the movie i was really bored
this is a very good film
it was n't even that good
thanks to the cast the script was a little weak
and the movie is a little too long for
the film is a complete failure
i was so excited to see this movie
there is a lot of good action and the movie is a bit slow
i have n't been a fan of the series since but this is a lot more of
some of the other actors are n't bad
dermot kaji as the mother of the family is also quite good
if you 're a fan of the original you 'll find this movie a little more entertaining than
despite the fact that the movie is about a woman she is a very nice woman
the movie is a complete mess of a film
a few years ago he was born to play
and the movie is a little slow
who would have been able to afford to
were they going to make a sequel
having said that i am a big fan of the original series
however i have n't seen a movie
he is a great actor and he 's a good
i have to admit that i have seen this movie twice and i am still stunned
why did n't she just go out and get
i do n't know what to say about this film but it does
its just not that funny and it 's not funny at all
but i do n't think that the director is a real person and that 's
in fact it 's a shame because the movie is n't really that good and it does not really matter
take it to yourself and you 'll be rewarded
but it 's a good movie that i would watch over and over again
by the end i was a little disappointed
the acting was good the story was interesting and it was a good movie
if you 're a fan of the genre and you have a strong stomach to watch
vincent cassel is a fine actress
but the real problem is that the film lacks
horrendous movie about the evils of war and the fact that
maybe the movie was made by the same director as the first movie
does it mean the movie is about a guy who has a
and the ending is so bad that you ca n't
while the story is not as bad as i 've ever seen the movie does n't even come close
there is a lot of violence in the movie
he 's not a bad actor and
the film is very well directed and the acting is great
a lot of people are complaining about this film
the film is a very good movie that is n't just about a young woman trying to get
it 's a pity because it is a movie that has a
haunted by the devil 's experiment and a few other comments i have read that this was a
i do n't think that the director could have done
this film was a waste of time
tobe hooper has made a few good movies
or the way they were made this movie should not
it is a shame that the film has n't received much attention
that 's the problem with this film
or maybe it 's a good idea that it would
a few scenes of a man walking around a table and a few of the
the acting is horrible and the story line is so bad it makes you wonder if the director is
the acting is very poor and i have no idea why they were n't given the name of the film
further the movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence but in the sense it is a bit
this movie is so bad it 's funny
a very interesting film about an aging woman who is a teenager and a man
great movie that is not just about
marking it is a film that will appeal to everyone who is a fan of hers
also the film has the best acting of the whole cast and it is a very enjoyable film
but the story is so predictable that it becomes impossible to follow
stupidity is a very bad thing
this movie was a waste of time
there is a reason why this is not a movie that i would n't have seen if it was n't
do n't waste your time on this
le boucher was the best film of the year
the acting is very good and the story is good
the film has an interesting premise but the story is so predictable that
we get a glimpse of what the director has done to make this film work
it 's not a bad thing to
when i first saw the trailer for this movie i thought i had seen it
i was expecting this movie to be a
james stewart 's character is a little too cocky and he has a very strong role
a very enjoyable and enjoyable film
pulling off the film 's message the film was made to look at the camera
the film was a complete waste of time
hurley is the best of the two
so the film is a bit too long
mgm 's the film has a few good
stewie 's character was a very likable and very likable character
it is not a movie to see
we are supposed to believe the director is trying to make a statement about the situation
i have to say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
bottom line if you 're looking for something like that you will probably be bored by this film
actually it 's just a movie
i was surprised that the movie was so poorly written and acted that i was
the movie is a very funny one
this is the best movie i have
this was the first film i 've ever seen in a while
the movie is a bit too long and it does
the acting and directing is superb
it 's a shame because i do
a very enjoyable movie and a mustsee for all ages
i think this movie has a great deal of humor
the film was a little slow at times and seemed to drag on
the film 's plot was so bad it made it impossible to follow the plot
the movie is a complete waste of time
according to this movie the movie 's plot is n't really that interesting
no one has ever seen this show
maybe the best part of this show is the fact that the
however i was n't impressed at how much it was
if the story was n't that great then i would n't have seen it
i have never been so disgusted by the film as i was to have seen the film
nikki is a great character and is a very good actress in this film
i do n't know what it 's like to be a fan of the original but i do n't
lack the oodles of talent in this film
plus the movie is not as good as it could have been but the acting was n't bad
will smith and his brother have a chance to get a hold of
simply put this is a great movie
nods the story and the characters are so bad it 's hard to believe that the writer and
as a movie it is a little bit too long and it 's
if you 're looking for a good horror flick you can find something
her performance is the worst of this movie
but the movie is a little too slow
i was n't really expecting much from this movie and i did
book was a great movie that was a lot of fun to watch
and i do n't want to give away the ending
i think it 's a good thing to have a movie that is not a good one at all
similar to the other films i 've seen this is one of those films that i
it is a very good movie
but it was the most boring and boring movie i have ever seen in my life
let 's just say that the movie is a little slow
yes i know it 's a movie about the columbine but the story is not that bad
but it 's a shame that the film never got better and better
towards this point the movie is a bit slow
can you say that this was one
dominic morita is great as the lead and he does a great job
with all the hype surrounding this film i would say that it is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
but it 's a shame because it has been done by a very talented director and
i was expecting something like that to be made
this is one of the few movies i saw on the starz that
the movie is not a complete waste of time
i do n't want to spoil the ending
too bad it did n't make it to the screen
i do n't understand why people have not heard of this movie
as for this movie i would n't have been able to see it in the first place
that 's the only thing i have to say about this film
mr bean 's performance was excellent and the film was a great success
the film is a bit of a mess but it is a very good movie and a very enjoyable one
i was surprised to see that this was the first
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
there are a few good moments but they are just not funny
i was surprised by the ending
for a movie made in the 70s i thought it was very good but it was n't
it was a waste of a good idea and good acting
this is the worst film i have ever seen
a good movie to have seen the first time and it 's a good movie
this film is a must see for all ages
the film is a bit too long for a long time but it 's not a great movie
about the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it 's a pretty lousy movie
it is a shame that this is a movie that
i have to say i have seen a lot of
the film was a waste of time
an excellent cast and a very good story line
looking at the film 's flaws i had to
the movie is about a young girl
and it is a shame that the director has never done a better job of this movie
also a lot of people are n't interested
he 's the best actor in the film
it is a movie that is n't a complete loss and is not a
my advice is to stay away from this one
fantastic movie about a woman who 's
the film is a very funny movie
having a good time in my life i was very disappointed
limited to the movie 's success it is a very good film and i hope it gets more
it is a shame that this film was released theatrically
if it 's on the imdb for a good laugh i would suggest you do n't watch it
for me this film has a lot of problems in its storytelling
by the end of the movie i was really bored
go watch it if only because it
the film is about a group of young men who are sent to a
i have to say i was n't impressed
lord of the rings has some good actors in it and the story is
like the rest of the film it was a complete waste of time
the movie is about a man who is a man
despite being a fan of his films i have to say that this movie is not a good film
the movie is a complete waste of time
but it is not a movie that is not a complete disaster
it has the best elements of the
she is a very good actress and is the
but it 's not the best movie
funny and funny and a bit scary
this movie is one of my favorites
along the way he meets a young girl and his son who is the daughter
this film is one of the best
this movie is one of the worst films i 've ever seen in my life
the movie has a few funny moments in it
a lot of the film is about the same
then the film goes on and on
the acting was horrible and the story just plain stupid
plot holes are not enough to make a movie
it was a waste of time
redux is the story of the life of the legendary painter of a young man named sosuke who
it is the most beautiful of its kind of film and it 's a great deal of time
seymour cassel is excellent as a woman who gets to
i have to admit that i was n't impressed with the film
the movie has a lot of action and the story is very interesting but that 's about all
one of his most important films
was it supposed to be a comedy
wwe 's most recent feature feature film is a classic and a must see
in fact it was n't even a movie that was n't a total waste
gone are the characters in the movie
still the film is not a complete waste
other reviewers say that this film is n't that bad but it is n't
the film is a bit of a
could n't they have had a better script
so if you 're looking for a good movie to watch with your friends and
both of these characters are so likable and lovable you ca n't help but feel sorry for them
the film was made in the seventies and the film 's only purpose was to get the audience to look at the film
i was n't expecting a lot of things
but the movie is n't as bad as the
he 's a very talented actor and i hope he will
i have seen it twice and i have never seen it since it was released in
why does the director have to make a film that
i do n't know if it is a bad movie or a good one
i do n't think this is the worst film i 've seen this year
oh and the last mimzy was a bit of a letdown
that 's the best thing in the movie
falls asleep and then the film is over
he is also a very nice actor who does not appear in the film as he plays
finally it is not a movie
but the movie is not about a man and
this is the worst film i have ever seen
a few years later the movie is a little bit of a stretch to sit through but still the whole film is a complete mess
as the movie progresses it becomes a bit more interesting and more interesting than it
not only is the story a little weak but the story is very interesting and
the acting is pretty bad and the acting is bad
i do n't think that it is that bad but it 's not a
my favorite part is when the guy is walking around in front of a car wielding and then a car explodes in the middle of the road
do not see this movie if you 're
the acting is good and it is a shame that the director did n't get
radio is the best movie i 've seen
fulci has done a decent job of making this film a good one
he 's a little stiff and has
i do not know what the point of this movie
a lot happens to the viewer and it 's not
standout is that the film is so funny
i do n't understand why the movie was made
however i have seen a lot of movies and this one is not for
i was n't impressed by this movie
i was surprised to find myself in the film and did not
2 a group of friends and their son are invited to the island to
the film has some very interesting elements
a lot of the movie is about a group of teens trying to find their way to a small town
an excellent example of how to make a movie
i do n't think i can ever watch it
obviously it was n't a good idea for a film to begin but i did n't think it was a bad idea
spoilers spoilers ahead i was expecting a good film
that is the most important aspect of the movie
pitt and his cohorts are the only ones who have to deal with the fact that they are
overpowered by a group of young adults who have been a little more successful in the past and have been a little more successful in the past years
the film is about two women who are married
sean connery was excellent and the rest of the cast was excellent
despite the fact that the film is set in the future the story is a bit of a mess
she 's a little more than a little girl
it 's just a shame that this movie was released in
of course it was n't the best movie ever made but it 's not the worst
in fact the only thing that kept me watching is the way that they were made
the film has a great deal of humor and a few moments of suspense
he is the best of the bunch
btw the acting is n't bad either
upon hearing the name of a movie called the film i thought that the director had a great sense of humour and i was
the acting is pretty good and the acting is excellent
i was surprised to see that the movie had a few good parts
at one point i was laughing
he was a little more convincing than his role in the movie
there 's a lot of good stuff here but there
quite frankly the story was n't as much
there is a reason to be a fan of the genre
the movie is a complete waste of time
the acting is very good but the script is not really good enough
anyway i do n't know what to say
since i have seen this movie i can safely say that i do n't think it is a good film
nothing is explained in the film and
i was surprised that the film was made
this is a movie that is not only the worst movie i
a lot of people have complained about this movie
so if you 're looking for something like the first two films you 'll love this one
and the movie has the same kind of humor
as the film continues to drag along with a very
add to the mix of the main characters and the characters that were n't in any
the movie is not about a man who is trying to find a way out of a normal life
i'm a huge fan of the original series but i did n't really care for the characters or the plot
a very enjoyable and very enjoyable movie
please please do not see this movie
this is one of those films that i would
the movie has a very good story
the film 's plot is so predictable
deed is one of those movies that i
as a result the movie is very boring
the movie is about a young boy
then the two men are in the car
if you 're going to have a film with a few twists and turns you 'll find yourself laughing
more than once it is a very enjoyable film
we are not told to care for the characters because we
the film is a complete mess
if you 're looking for a good movie that does n't make sense and is a complete waste of time then this is the
in this case the movie is not about a man who
truth is it is n't that much of a surprise to watch
everyone involved in this movie should have been ashamed of
we get the idea of how the film is going to end
i was so bored by this movie i was surprised that i had spent the money with
this is a very bad movie
for a while the movie is about as much a mystery as the first one
we are shown a very different story
there is no reason to watch this film
i was surprised at the lack of a plot
the movie is a bit long and the plot is very simple
just do n't expect a good plot and you have the movie
this film was made for the first time in the us
and i was impressed by the fact that
the film is a complete bore
nothing is explained and the movie ends with
these are the kind of movies that you should
enid and her friends are in the same place with the girl and her father
it is a movie that will make
she 's the only reason why i gave this movie 2 stars
i have to agree that the movie was a bit of a mess and i did n't care for the character development but
in this film the main character is a young
all i can say is that the movie is not bad it 's just a bad movie
visually the film is a very interesting
rock hudson is the only one who
note the fact that the movie 's title is
he 's a little stiff and he 's just a little more annoying than the rest of the cast
first of all it is a movie that i
on this one the movie has a great score by the legendary ennio morricone
a good movie for a rainy day
watch it if you are a fan of the series and do
the film is very well directed and acted
i do n't want to spoil the plot because i do n't think i have a spoiler but
we are supposed to be a bit skeptical about the movie but the story is
the movie is a bit slow but
rachel mcadams was a great actress and she was great in the part
however the movie is not about a man who is a man and he
i do n't think it 's a good movie
i do n't know why this movie is so bad
i have never seen a movie like this in my life that i could n't even sit through this one
i was surprised that the film was n't released in the us in the uk
kristen kudrow is excellent here and she is great in her role as the young woman
what 's with all these elements in
our heroes are a bunch of people in a small provincial community
i was n't sure if the director was trying to make it a horror film or
despite the fact that it is a movie about the evils of a family life the story is
when he is asked by his friend to help him out of
next to the first half of the movie i was a little skeptical about how the film was shot
despite being an original film it 's not the same one as in the original
a few of them were good
i think the director should be ashamed to have seen this one
there 's a lot of good stuff to be found in this movie
while it does n't work for the rest of the movie it
in fact it was a waste of time
the movie is very good and the acting was excellent
every time i watch the film it 's not even
the movie is a very good movie
but the film is a bit of an exercise in the genre and the acting is not as
the movie is not a complete waste of time
i was n't expecting a lot of
this film is a must see for everyone
if the film is a little slow at least it is not a total disaster
also the film was shot in the same location as the first
on the other hand it is a great movie
and i do not know how many people who have
head of a nation is a film that will
still this movie has the best acting i have ever seen
while this movie is not a good one it 's not bad it 's just bad
and the film is a bit of a mess and a little too long
oh and the last scene with a woman who is supposed to be a little too old
she 's not the best actress in the world
it 's not a bad thing that the movie is not as great as the original
i was n't sure whether it was a bad film or not but it was good
but i have n't seen it yet
jake 's character was a little more interesting to me than the other
first of all i do n't know why this movie was made
i do n't know if it was the fact that i saw the movie but i
i'm a big fan of horror movies
what is the purpose of this film
musical number 2 is an excellent film and i recommend the movie
accompanied by the usual hollywood style of the late 70s this film
it is the story of a young man who has to cope
she is a very attractive and sexy woman
the movie is about a young man who is a little too old
the film was a bit of a mess but
as the film goes along it 's a little slow and boring and it does
cole is the only one who is a good person and he is a very good actor
this film is a must for all fans of the genre and the
it 's a very good story
at first i did n't know that the film was going for a comedy but i was n't disappointed
but i do n't think the movie is
a very good film that i would recommend to those who love the genre
also i have to say that the movie is very good
a few years later the movie has its charms
you know that the film is a complete disaster
the movie is about the power of the human spirit and the consequences
certainly it is the best film i
why do i give this movie a 10
as a result the movie is a bit slow but the acting is excellent the direction is superb and the story line is a bit too weak
i do n't know how it was going to end but it was a little bit of a disappointment
also the film was very well made
one thing that i did not understand is why they
really the only one that i can recommend is the fact that the film was shot with an open mind
it 's not a movie that is a little bit too much
this is one of those movies that has a very strong message to it and it
the film is a bit too long
the movie is a complete mess of mine
eugene hutz is a great actor and he 's very good here as the main character
result in this movie the acting is terrible
branagh 's direction is a little uneven but
the movie is not as good as the first one it 's not
apart from that it was a very good and enjoyable film
the film is very good but it 's too late and the story is
the film was shot in color
for a long time he is a very talented actor and he 's a
one of the worst movies of all time
minnie driver plays a very likable and likable character
anyways i have a lot of fun with
this is the kind of film that is not even close to
although i have seen this film several times i can still remember that i was watching it with my friends at
hitchcock 's the film is an adaptation of the
can anyone please stop laughing and say that
not to mention the fact that he 's in the movie
not to be taken as a film and it 's not a bad thing
monk was the best character ever
rubin and his wife are in love with the girl and they
also the film is not about the evils of a war but
the film has a very good cast and
the movie has an interesting plot but the story is n't as good as the original
a good cast is wasted in a movie
it is not a good movie and it is n't
the film 's plot is a mess
for those who are not familiar with the original series the movie does not have a great deal of depth and
indeed i was not impressed with the movie
yeah it is a little corny but the acting was great
if you want to watch this movie you will not be disappointed
lawrence is a young girl who has a boyfriend who
rudd 's performance is very poor and the script
after the first half hour i thought i 'd throw in some spoilers and the movie was pretty good
dr hackenstein 's character is a very likable character
to make matters worse it seems that the director has no idea what to do with the story
it 's a shame that the movie
there 's a bit of the story of a young man who has to
bing 's character is the only one who
in this case the movie is a bit slow but i think
the film is a little too much for me
it 's the kind of movie that i would n't want to watch again
a lot of people who have reviewed it have commented
it 's not that i have n't seen this film since it 's
and i do n't know how to
by the end i was n't sure what to expect
this film is a complete waste of time and money
as the title says the movie is a complete mess
ok the plot has a lot of holes and the story is very weak
everything else is so bad and so lame
i was surprised that i had never heard of it
i have never seen a more beautiful version of this movie in a while
now i do n't know why i did
le samourai is a film that should be watched for no reason and for all its flaws
anyway i do n't think it 's a bad movie but it is n't a bad movie it 's good
5 the story of the film is a bit of a mess but i do n't think that it is a movie that is n't
the acting is good and the plot is a little too convoluted
it is a very good film and a great example
moreover the film is not as good as
this is one of the best movies
i do n't think this is the best film ever
i have seen the movie and i have to say that i 've never seen a movie that is so bad that i ca n't even
some of the scenes are just plain
i have n't seen it since i first saw it in a theater and it was a great movie
he has a very small part
all i can think of it was the music
much of the film is shot in the same location as in the first film
it was a good film and i
if you 're a fan of the original series and you know that the series
austin duck is a great example of
before i wrap this up i have to say that the film was a bit too long for the majority of the audience
unlike the other films i have seen in my life the film is
the film is a complete failure and the acting is terrible
the film 's plot is a little thin
the film is not a documentary about how the world of the world of the revolution is
nearly every scene in the film was
the film was shot on location in new york and the production design
the story is a bit confusing and the ending is a bit too
which brings me to a very positive conclusion that this
it 's not the worst of the bunch but i
in fact it 's a bit of a stretch of the movie
but the film is a bit of a bore
if you 're not a fan of the book i recommend this film
the acting was terrible and the script was so bad that i could n't even care less about the character
the acting in this movie is very good
lol i have to say that this was a very good movie but i
but it 's still a good movie to watch
you 'll be glad you do
the acting and directing was excellent
she has a good time and she is n't just a bad
unless you 're looking for an action flick with lots of action and a few laughs
in the meantime of this movie the viewer is asked to believe that they are
it 's not that it 's a bad movie
how could you possibly feel that you 're watching a documentary about how a film can be done with
but this film is a total mess
woman and her boyfriend is the best of them and the two
it 's not even that bad
now the story was pretty basic but the acting and the
not only did they have a lot of fun making it to the end but they did n't really do anything to make this movie
i do n't understand why the director decided to give this one a try and
the film 's plot is a bit thin but it is still a great movie
stuck in the middle of a road trip to a local town where a bunch of people have their own problems
would n't they have had a clue about the movie
will you see that the film is n't a complete failure
on the other hand if they 're going to make a film about the evils of war they would be a better place to watch
this is a great movie and i
i have to say this film is a great example of what a film should
director john frankenheimer has made a great film in which his life is a
the film is a little slow and boring
until the very end of the movie you are left wondering why they bothered to go out and get rid
but it 's not the same
the movie is a little too much for a younger crowd
the film has an excellent cast and the actors do n't help either
he 's not a very good actor he is a bad actor
even though it was n't a good movie i did not think that it was
the acting was terrible the plot was bad and the plot was so stupid
everything is so bad and so boring that you have to wonder why they did
of course there is a lot of action
john goodman is the most convincing and most likable character of the bunch
two of the main characters are the main villains
everyone is so happy with their lives and
however this movie is a complete waste of time
erin is not a good actress but she is a real talent
this is the worst film ever
so i have to say i was very
most of the movie takes place during the
this is the first of the three movies i saw
2 it is a movie that is not worth watching
so if you 're looking for a movie that is n't
it is a very interesting movie and
just as you would think it was a little bit of a stretch to watch it again and again it 's a great movie to
i think that 's what it 's a
only one of them is the same person who was supposed to have a lot of time to be a part of
after a while the film is a bit too long
a lot of the film is set in the middle
well this movie has a lot more to offer but it 's a good movie
this is a very bad movie
the film has a lot of good points and a few scenes but it
i was n't expecting the usual plot to be a bit of an
thus the film is about a group
this is a very good film with
shooting a few minutes of the movie and then you have a good movie
unlike the first movie i have to admit that this is one
i do n't think this is why i
if you 're looking for a fun movie with a good story this one is for you
gary busey is excellent in this film and
all in all a great movie
i'm not going to give away the ending
but it 's just not enough to save your time and
the film was shot in a time capsule and the camera work was so grainy that it
it 's a great movie to watch
the film is a little slow and the plot is a little confusing
anyone who has ever seen a good film should be advised to watch the movie
and it is a good film for those with a heart
i was expecting a movie with the same title as i did and
for the first time in my life i was n't able to see the movie until the end
the film is very well done and
on the other hand the acting is very good
cassavetes is a master and a director of the film
by the way it is a very good movie
ok so i was a little confused when the first movie started
after a few episodes of the series the
i have seen this movie twice and i can honestly say it was a good movie
i have to say that i was impressed with the acting
it 's not a bad film
in fact the only good scene is when the two roommates meet the killer and then
some scenes are so stupid that you can actually see the actors in their roles
the film was made in the late 1930 's and early seventies
hopefully it was the same way that they did n't
the acting is very good but the
and it is a shame that the director has never seen a film where the story has been done
but the movie is so bad that
in fact the whole thing is just a bunch
the acting in this movie is so bad that
i was so impressed by it that it was so boring
that 's a big problem because it 's
yes the film has some interesting points but it 's not
this movie is a great movie
it 's a shame that this film
almost every character is a stereotype who has
in the end the movie is a bit too slow for me
the film 's premise is that of a man who is a loner and his son who has
i do n't understand what the director was trying to accomplish but i was n't expecting a lot from the story and it was n't even
so the story is about a young girl named caroline who is married with a woman who is married to a woman who is
but i do n't think it is
del toro 's acting is excellent and i have seen him in a
the acting is pretty good and the script is pretty good
i have seen this movie twice and i am still stunned
these two are not very good actors but they are great
all i know is that i do n't think it was a great film
a very enjoyable and entertaining film
or the fact that the film is a complete mess of
the film is not as bad as the first
like i said the story was very good and it was the first time i saw it
even though it has been said that the film is a
not only is he a bad actor he also is a very talented actor who is n't a bad guy and is not the worst character he has
most of the film takes place in the same location
i was surprised to find that this was one of those films that i
i have seen this movie several times and i have
i do n't know what to do but the film is a complete
but the movie is n't as good as it should
the movie is a little over the top but it is n't that bad either
there are some very funny moments in this movie
you can tell the director was trying to get his
in the end it 's a good thing to say
this movie is so bad it 's good
it 's a pity because it was a bit too long and i think the
as a matter of fact it 's a shame
lisa is a very good actress who is a real actress and she 's very good as the mother
instead of the usual clichs that are the same type of jokes the movie is just a bunch of bad guys
for the rest of the movie there are some very interesting moments
i think this film is a masterpiece of the genre
these two men are also very good and the film is a real treat
partly the film is a bit too long
while i do n't know if this is a comedy it 's a very bad film
yes it 's not that great but it 's still a good movie
meanwhile the movie begins with the arrival of two men
they were n't all that bad
we are supposed to believe that a bunch of
i do n't think that the director intended to be a film
it was a very funny show that i would watch
i was surprised by this film
bravery is not a bad thing
but it 's a good idea
the film 's plot is a little weak
this movie is a complete waste of my time
some of the scenes are so bad it is
a good cast is wasted on a few scenes that are n't worth the
the story is about a bunch of people who are trapped in a house and are forced to work together in a haunted mansion
the film is about a young boy named kenny who is a little boy who
spoiler alert the film 's plot summary was n't that bad but the
it is not a good movie but it is a great movie
the film is not about the war of
it 's not even that good and is n't a good movie
audience applause is the only thing that is n't bad
for those who like the original and are the only thing you can
certainly the worst movie i have ever seen
calling it a horror movie is a mystery
sure it is the best film i 've seen this year
he is the most talented actor in the history of
randy quaid is the best actor ever
honestly it 's a very good film
if you are looking for something more than just a movie you 'll have to watch this movie
the film 's story is a little too
charlie brown is the only actor in the movie that
all of this is a very good thing
i was so impressed when i heard that it was the best movie i 've ever seen
the movie is about a man who has a wife and son who is a man
i was n't impressed with the story but it 's still a good film
but it 's a great movie
the film is a very good film
among other things that were missing was that it was n't really a
for those who like the original and the first one i would say this is a good movie
i do n't think that it 's a great movie to make a good movie but the acting was good and the story was good
in a way i do n't think that the actors are good enough to be the one who is not in this film
if you want something a little more exciting than you might want to see it
the acting is horrible and the plot is so predictable and so unbelievable it 's hard to follow
this film has a very good story line
this movie has a very good cast
it 's a pity that the film has n't been
but i do n't think it 's a good
the movie is not a complete waste of time
an interesting and very interesting story of two young lovers who are searching for a missing man
mr bean is a very talented actor
i do n't know how it got made
i was n't impressed by the film
if you 're looking for a film that is n't a complete waste of film
bought a ticket for the next dvd
i'm glad i did n't get the chance to watch this movie
just as you would have to be a big fan of the
overall i would rate this movie a
two of the best actors of the movie are the supporting characters and they all have an
overall the film is very good for a rainy day but
but this movie has a good message
while the film has some flaws the film is also a bit long
i'm not sure why i watched this movie
having seen the original version of this film i have to admit that the acting was pretty good
chris farley plays a very good character
so if you want to see a really good movie that is good enough to
the story is a little weak and it 's
if you want to know about the real life of the real artemisia you 'll be disappointed by the movie
she is also a woman who is in love with her
also the ending was very predictable and did n't really add anything to the story at
i have never seen a worse movie in my entire life
jeff goldblum plays a young boy who is
the film is about a young woman named seita who lives
after a long time i was a little skeptical about the movie and it seemed that i had to watch this movie to get the full
neither of those movies were so much more than this
although it does n't have a happy ending it 's still a great movie to watch for all
i was n't expecting much from this film
to be fair it was a good movie to watch but i would n't have to give it a chance
and that 's what it is about
if you have seen it you 'll know what to expect
i'm not sure if the director intended to be a fan of the original or the first film
mixed with the usual clichs of a movie i 've seen a lot of movies that have been
maybe he should be ashamed to have a better life
enid and her friends are the only ones who have to deal with their problems and the fact that they are all alone in the same building is very much the same
the film was a waste of time for the viewer
this is a very bad movie
we 're supposed to be a bit of an observer of the characters but this movie was so bad that it was hard to
did they really need to get to the point where they
then the film switches gears and the film becomes tiresome and boring
the film is a complete mess
and the ending is very abrupt and the
they 're just so stupid and so boring that you ca n't help
will smith and his brother have a small time
be prepared to be disappointed by the fact that the
at the end of the movie the only thing that i did n't really like in my life
i was so impressed by the story and the performances and the music
the acting was terrible the plot is ridiculous the
reasons for this movie are the worst of the bunch
sanjay dutt is excellent as always
in the end the movie is a complete waste of time and time
i was surprised to see this movie on tv as a child
it is the worst movie ever made
i was surprised that the film did get
talking about the plot of the film
these are not the best movies of this type and the ones with the ones in it that
thanks to the fact that the movie is not as good as it is the director is not
this is a great film and i would recommend
the acting in this movie is horrible and the plot is a bit contrived
a lot of people are talking about the movie and it 's not even that funny
let me start by saying that i have to admit that
whilst the story is not a great one it still manages to be entertaining
just as a film it is not
captain kirk is an excellent character study of the life of a young boy
in a way i think that the film is a masterpiece of a movie
instead of being an action movie it was just a waste of time
there is a lot of action and a lot of fun
i have seen this film twice
but the real problem with this movie is that it is not a
drive the car is a film that will be remembered for its rightful release
this was a very good film and i think it is
it 's a shame to see such a great actor in a role
just as the first time we watch it we have
only a few people will see the movie and i do agree with the reviewer who stated that
god bless the world of a good movie
the movie is a bit slow but i do n't know what
there 's a lot to like about this movie
this movie is one of my favorites and it 's
these are some of the most interesting things i 've seen in
definitely the best film of 2001
though it is not the best movie ever made it 's still a great movie
i have to admit that i have seen this movie twice and still have n't seen it
then i saw it on the shelf at
the film 's plot is a little confusing and the ending is predictable
this movie was a great example of how a movie
birkut 's performance is a little stiff and his voice is very poor and his voice is dubbed by a
like the previous reviewer said i did n't like that
major spoiler the film was n't as much a comedy as i thought
first of all this movie is a waste of time
beyond all the plot holes the movie has a few flaws
the film is about a group of
i was expecting a lot of the
many of the actors in the movie are very talented
on the other hand the movie is very well done and it does n't help
as a result it is n't a movie to be taken seriously
but the movie is a bit slow
i have to say that i was n't impressed by the film
it 's the kind of movie that makes it a
there 's a lot of good stuff here but there are a few
context to a film is that it 's a
we are supposed to sympathize with the characters and the story
when he gets to the bottom of the road the two of

richard gere is a great actor but the movie is just plain boring
although it is a bit dated and the story is very good the acting is pretty decent
the acting is very poor and the acting is just
his acting was so bad i could have sworn he was the
i do n't want to ruin the film by saying that i have seen
probably the worst movie i have ever seen
i was expecting a good movie
that is a good thing but i do n't know what the point of this
although the film is not as great as the original and with the exception of a few other minor actors it is a great film
except to the director who did n't make a good movie it 's not even that funny
especially the scene where the two guys are talking to the
entertainment was n't a bad idea
too bad they do n't have to be in the movie
we are left with a sense of the film
the movie is about a bunch of young people who are living in a small town and have been living for
we get to see the first two movies in the series
as a matter of fact the film was shot in a small budget
we have a movie that is so bad that it makes you laugh out loud
the acting is very good but not a great performance
there is a lot more action in this movie than most of the other films i
before i watched this film i had to see the movie and thought that this was a very well made
a few of the other actors are good but the movie is not very good
the acting is pretty good and it is a good movie
i do n't want to give anything away
the film was a waste of time and money
now i am not a fan of the genre but this one is a real treat
the story is about a group of four who decide to spend a weekend together with a bunch of people and their friends
i have to wonder how much the movie sucks
typical operating procedure is a film about an unhappy woman who is a teenager
he is not a good actor
the film 's plot is about as interesting as a brick 's cup of tea
god knows how to make movies that make you think and make you think
few movies have a shred of humor and the acting in this movie was horrible
the film is not about the evils of war but rather a political statement about a man who is a
still i do not recommend this movie
he is a very talented actor and he 's not just a bad
footnote the film has a great deal of humor in it
the film is a complete mess
the film 's main character is a young man who lives with a young woman in his apartment
blame for the fact that i have seen this movie several times and i can only assume that the director was a very
technically i think the movie 's biggest flaw is that it is n't even close to the
there is a scene in the movie where the camera is trying
i have seen the movie twice but i have to say i was impressed with the
aykroyd is one of my favorite actors and this is his most funniest performance
there 's no real plot no tension no action no suspense no action no
watching this movie i thought that it was
it 's a great story and it
it 's a shame the only negatives are that it has a very low budget
a very good story of the man who is a man who is searching for a missing life and is not afraid to live with his
this film has no redeeming features
however the film is n't so bad that the director
the acting is very good the plot is a little weak
the film was shot in black and white and it 's a very nice
i was n't expecting a lot from this film and it was n't even good enough
we have the same director who did a very good
throughout the movie i felt that i could n't get enough of this film
other than that the acting is pretty good
here 's where the story is going to be the
the film is about a young man who is diagnosed with a terminal illness that is not fully understood in his life
he 's a little stiff but it
at the same time the film has a very long shot and the actors seem
sequences of a film are so poorly written that it makes
he 's the kind of person who is n't afraid of being a hero
the film was shot in the early seventies and was very much in color
for me i have to admit that the acting is pretty good but the script is not bad
i was n't expecting anything else from the movie
mirren 's character was the only character that seemed to care for her character and she was n't even the least bit likable
finally the film is not as good as the first film
edward everett horton is a revelation
do n't worry to see it

i have n't seen the first one but i do n't know where
yes i do n't know what the point of this movie was
however the film is a little slow
director john woo has made an impressive film and the result is an
unfortunately it is n't the best movie ever made
the acting is very good and the story lines are great and the actors are all excellent
i do n't think i have ever seen
and it 's not even funny
the film 's plot is about a group of people who go into an abandoned haunted house to assassinate the inhabitants of the
lance hayes plays the part of the young and very very very very very rich
flynn 's character is a bit too
i was expecting a lot more from this film but it
i have to say that i was very impressed with the acting the directing
this is the best of all
mandy 's character is so stupid that you
the movie is very funny but not
i'm not saying that this film is n't that bad but it 's just not
a good cast of supporting characters and a good story
she is the only person in the film who is a bit more than a little stiff
it 's a shame the rest of the cast did n't work as
while the plot is n't the worst i 've ever seen i 've never been so disappointed by the
i was n't expecting much from this movie but i was expecting something
by the end of the movie you are a bit more likely you will have the
if you have a choice for a movie that is not a good one to watch and is not a great film
so if you 're a big fan of the original you will like this movie
indeed i have to say i was very impressed
the film 's main flaw is that it has a few flaws in it that are not worth mentioning that it has the
this film is a complete waste of
the film is a little slow but the story is very well written and the characters are likable
the movie was shot in a small country in california and it was made for television
i was expecting something like the first movie but the first one was so bad that i
this is a very good movie
this film is not only the most entertaining movie but
do n't worry about this movie
the movie starts off as an interesting premise
the acting is horrible and the plot
i was expecting the movie to be good but this one was n't
the movie is a very bad one
le cercle rouge is a very good movie
the story is about a young man who lives in a small

after seeing this movie i had to say i
erika eleniak plays a woman who is trying to solve a mystery
i was n't impressed with this movie
sometimes you get a chance of a movie
i have to say that this film was a
sure it has some of the worst acting
i think this film was a waste
grodin is a great actress in this film
though this movie was not a good one it is still very enjoyable and very good
when the movie was released i had a headache
there are many things wrong with this film
she 's a great actress but she 's not the only one who has the chops
this is the kind of movie that i
it was the worst film i have ever seen
it 's a shame because it is
in the end i was n't really expecting a movie
whilst i am a fan of horror movies and this one was a complete disappointment
it has a lot of potential and the acting is pretty good

it is a shame that this film is so bad that i ca n't wait for the
it is a very good movie and it is
nowadays i do n't know how to describe
that 's the only reason i can watch this
i have to say i was very impressed by this film
based on a true story this was a very good movie with a great cast
it is not even worth a look for a movie that 's just as
any movie that has a plot to be a good movie is a waste
tha is the only thing i liked and i do n't like the
and that 's not all it 's supposed to be
people who do n't like this movie
i think the director should have done a better job
anyone who has a sense of humor knows about this movie should be
i have seen it many times
i do n't know why this movie was released theatrically
however the movie was n't really worth watching
after all this is a film of a young woman who 's been kidnapped by a man who has been murdered
the film has a very interesting and interesting ending that i thought was a little too long
all the characters were believable and i was very interested
i think that it is a great movie
never mind that the film is a total failure
you have a good time watching this movie
i do n't know why i did n't see this movie at a festival of my
on a side note it is a film that is not a complete failure
actually it 's not a bad movie but it does n't
they are all very funny and funny
happy to see a film that was released theatrically and released in the
ever since this film was released i was a little surprised by the way the movie
i was so excited about the movie i had to watch it
this is a very good film
the acting is horrible the script is awful the acting is awful the script is bad
even though it was n't a good movie i would have given it a lower rating
her husband and her son are the only one who is a
i have n't read the book but this movie was not to be missed
i have n't seen this movie since i was a young kid and i still remember it vividly
so the film is a little slow and it does have some nice parts but it is n't
you can see that the movie is not the best movie i have ever seen but it 's
but it is a very good movie
it 's a great movie and i recommend it to everyone who wants to see
but this is a film that will appeal to all ages and should be
the film was a waste of time
they are both a good movie and a good one
the movie has a great deal of suspense and a good story but the acting
linda blair is one of her most beautiful and her character 's are the most memorable
they were n't even good enough
it 's the kind of movie you 'd want to watch
this movie is not for everyone
again this movie is a total waste of time
the movie starts off as a comedy
i was n't expecting a lot of it but i was very impressed
i was expecting a lot more from the movie but i found it to be very boring
he is a great director and he
this was a great movie for a rainy afternoon
this movie has a great cast and
like i said the acting is pretty good and the script is
henry fonda is one of my favorite character actors
in the end it was a great movie
this film is a very bad attempt to make a film
people who have been looking for some of them are not very good at this one
the film was shot in the seventies
the film is a bit of a mess
1st watched this with the intention of seeing it in the theatre and it 's a very good
the film is about two men and their relationship with a married woman
i do n't know what to say about it
he was the only one who had to
hartley 's direction was very good
it was a very nice movie and a great one for the whole family
it 's a shame that the director of the movie did not have the money to use it
and the movie does n't make any sense
i have to admit that i was n't impressed by the film
the film was very funny and i think the director was trying to make the movie funny
the film is not a bad film
instead of being a good guy he is a good guy
i do n't know why i have n't heard about this film since it was
with a few exceptions and an interesting story this movie is a very interesting one
the movie has a few funny moments
i was n't expecting a great movie
as i said earlier it was a very good movie
broadway is a great film that is not only a classic film but also a good movie
when i was younger i was so excited to see a movie with such a good cast
the movie has some great scenes but it is a bit too slow and too slow
the movie is very good and the acting and direction of the movie is excellent
first off the acting was horrible and the story
war movies are not the only one in the world that they are made
as a result it 's a little too talky for the viewer to suspend interest
again i do n't want to give away the fact that the movie
these two are not the only ones who are willing to go to a party
i was n't expecting a great movie but this one is so bad
and the movie was so bad
all in all a great film
but the movie is a bit of an action movie and it 's not
i was expecting a good movie
the acting is horrible the script is awful and the plot just seems to drag along
voodoo and blood and gore is a film for you
first of all the acting is horrible
according to imdb users that i have a problem with the film and
another thing that bothered me was when the first one ended up in the middle of the movie
but i have to disagree with the
this movie has a very good story line
it was a very nice movie
the movie has a lot of good things to say
what a waste of a film
his character is so annoying it 's impossible to believe he 's supposed to be the hero or the character he plays
sailor is a very funny movie that is n't
i have to say that i 've seen this movie
spoilers ahead i do not know what it 's all
a few years later the young man is still alive and the film ends with him
oh yes i know it 's a good movie
the movie has a very nice soundtrack but the music is also very
she has a very good body and she has the same accent
it is a very funny movie
then there 's a scene where a woman is killed in the woods and is stabbed in the head
the movie is very well acted and the story was
the movie is a complete mess
i have never seen the original so i
straw gordon is a wonderful actor who
slowly the story is told in flashback
in fact i would have preferred to see more of him in
if you want to see a great movie that is a good one to watch and is definitely worth a look
the film 's plot is so thin that it 's difficult for me to find it anywhere
she is not only a little girl but a very human and a very loving person
never mind that this is an excellent film
visually the movie is not about the evils of life and the
in the first movie there is a very funny scene where the two men
the film is about a young woman who moves into the house to
you know that the movie is a good idea for a
it is n't that i have to admit that i have to admit it 's
as a result i was not able to find the remote of this film
spoiler alert the movie has a few moments of comedy but it 's just not enough
from the beginning of the film the viewer is treated with an explanation of the characters and
along the way they are arrested and the family is killed
i was surprised that this was a movie that was released in the early 1980s but it is still a good
spoon eater is a very good film
this movie is so bad that it
more than a few things that have been said before and i have to say that the acting is good
i was n't expecting much from this movie
i was expecting something better from the movie
the movie is about a group of people who are in love
spoilers the film was n't a complete waste of time
however the movie is a little too much for me
so the movie is a bit too long and the ending was too abrupt and predictable
the film was made in a very cheap
the acting is very bad the story line is bad the script
though the movie was a little long i did n't know what the director was trying to accomplish
distributed in the us and the us
first of all it is a movie that
the film is a complete mess and the acting is horrible
the movie is a little bit too long for a movie like this
the acting is good the story is great and the acting is good
ace ventura is a very funny movie
one of the best of this series was the one in which the two main characters are in the background
sydney is a very talented director and the film is a perfect example of how a film should be
some of the scenes are so bad they 're funny
in fact the film is a bit slow and it
can the director 's cut to the film 's end
total crap and the only thing that
i'm sure that this movie has a good
it is a very good film
one of the best of the series
i do n't know why i did n't see this film in my memory
what is the difference between the two
apparently the film 's success is not a good one
inspired to the very end of the film
in this case he has to be one of the greatest actors of the silent era
and the ending is a bit too abrupt
stale and boring and not funny
it 's a very funny movie
i have n't seen a movie so bad that i
the movie has a few good moments
thanks to the fact that the film is not only a comedy it does not have a lot of funny moments
i was n't expecting the usual suspects to make a movie but the story was pretty good
several people who have commented on this show are either idiots or people who are n't interested in anything but
as i said before i do not like the movie but it is a very good
the acting in this film is excellent
for a long time i have to say that this is the best movie of the year it 's not a great movie but it is a
panzram is the most powerful and most sympathetic character in history history
and i have no idea why it has n't been a cult classic since the dawn of the dead but the
i was n't expecting much from this one but it was a great movie
some people have claimed that the movie is a masterpiece of its
the movie is very funny but it
then again i do n't know why i do n't know what to say
much of the acting was horrible and the plot was just too weak
with this one i would say that this is one movie that i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good movies
davis is the only one who seems to be able to
james garner is a great actor
and i do n't want to spoil my feelings about it
but the film is n't that great
some scenes were filmed in a very
it was a great movie and the actors were great
you have to be kidding me
i do not recommend this film to anyone who has n't seen it yet
first i must say that i have never
cringeinducing acting terrible acting and a bad script
so if you are a fan of the original series
in the end i was n't sure whether the director was trying to make it to the next clouseau 's
the film is very well made
this movie was so awful that i could n't even finish the movie
overall it was a pretty good movie
when i was a teenager this movie was a joke
inki is the most annoying movie i 've ever
the film is a little slow but it 's not
in this film the characters are all very different from the original
the film is not about a group of people who live in a small
and i do n't think it is a good
despite the fact that the movie was made by a group of kids it is a film about the evils of life in a small
the film has a very interesting plot and a very good ending
despite the fact that it is a very good movie i think it is
you 'll be glad you did
they are not in the movie for
besson 's direction is excellent but not the greatest
from the very beginning i found it hard to believe that this was a movie about the evils of the human condition
in fact it was so bad i was n't expecting a
this is a movie that you can watch with your
after seeing it i was surprised that it did n't have to be seen as a movie
for me i was a bit prejudiced
faith domergue is a good actress and
the acting was good but the script and acting were horrible and the plot line was just plain stupid
the acting was horrible and the writing
maybe it was because i had a hard time believing that it was the same movie
it is a shame that the movie is a bit too long
after a while i was hooked
the movie is about two men who are married to the same man who is a child and they
this is not a movie about how
the acting is good but the story
in the end the movie has a lot to
if you have n't seen this movie you should see the original
med students and other relatives are all in
there is a very good reason to watch this movie
this is not a movie for everyone
the acting was good but it did n't work
i was expecting a lot more from this film but i did n't think that the
where is this film going to make it
it has a good plot and great acting
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
but the story is n't that bad
i was expecting a lot more than this but this one was so bad that it could n't be
the movie is a complete waste of
it is n't a movie that i would watch for any more than i
when i saw the movie i thought the movie was very interesting
another problem is the fact that it is a very
playing the role of an old friend who is a very young woman
david cronenberg has a great sense of humor
she is a great actress and she
the film has a very interesting story and a good story
but the film 's biggest flaw is its lack of originality
if you want to see a good movie that has been done with a lot of money and the
they are both funny and funny
watching it again i was n't impressed
the movie has the best of the three
oh and the last scene in the movie was a bit too long
santa claus has a lot of fun and
perhaps the most important element of this film was the fact that the film was
so what if the movie was n't that bad
spencer tracy is a great actor and he 's very good here
it is not that i do not have a problem with it
the film was shot at the height of a small budget but it was n't
the story is about a group of young men who are married and have a
2 it was n't a movie
the film has a very good plot line and a very nice ending
the acting was good but the script was so poor that i could n't
the acting is very bad and the script is just awful
storywise it 's not as good as the
it 's a shame because it 's a great film
and the ending was so predictable
if i had n't seen the first one i would 've been a little surprised
sadly the movie was made to look at the camera and the actors
spoiler ahead i was n't expecting much from this film and was pleasantly
in the end the movie ends up being a little predictable
but i do n't think it 's the best movie in the genre
from the very beginning the film is very well made and the acting is superb and the acting and
the movie is about a young girl
it was a good movie to watch
firstly the movie is a bit slow but it
the movie is a bit of a mess
it 's not that i have n't seen the film
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
the acting in the film is so bad that i could n't help but laugh
but the real star of this movie is the fact that the
secondly the film is not a good movie to be honest but the movie is a good
jackie gleason is the perfect villain and he plays a character who is
rounding out the cast is the array of actors
an excellent film with a very strong cast
sure the movie was a little too slow
he 's a great actor and i can tell you that i am not a fan of
the movie is not about a young woman named seita who is married to the woman who has been murdered by
three of the characters are a bit of a caricature and the film is
it was the best of the four films i 've seen but it
if you are looking for a movie to make a movie watch this
even the actors were n't very good at this time
use the same plot as the original
i was expecting a lot of the same old stuff but i did n't like the
this movie has a lot to do
a few minutes of my life that i had
they have a lot more to say than they did in the
and the acting was n't bad
they 're all very well done
unless you 're not a fan of the original you 'll probably enjoy it
the movie was made for television and was
but this film is a real stinker
the movie is a bit slow but the ending is a bit too abrupt
best of all is the fact that this film has no redeeming qualities at all
i was so impressed by the story and the story
there are some good moments and some very funny moments
i think the movie has a lot of fun and i recommend it to
enduring reality is the most interesting thing about this movie
how did the director and producers manage to create a film that is so utterly devoid of
i was n't expecting much from the movie at least not as much as
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
well it 's a movie that you can do without a lot of
ace ventura is the most beautiful and beautiful character of this film
the story is a little confusing but the movie is a bit too slow for its own
so the movie is n't really a comedy
another thing that i did n't like about this show was that i was so excited to see the show and it 's so bad
art carney is a good actor in
this was a good idea for a
how many of us have seen this movie and have n't seen it in the theater
all in all a great show
i have to say this is one
lancaster 's portrayal of the character is very believable and he 's not the only one in the movie that is so good that it
wish they had made it a little more fun to
i have n't seen it since the late sixties and i had
let me say that i was n't
watch the original and see if the film has n't been remastered in
if you 're looking for a movie that is n't funny
colin firth 's character was a bit annoying
do n't worry that i wasted a rental
be careful if you have n't seen the film
particularly the scene where she 's talking about
the movie is a bit slow but the plot twists
it was a waste of time and money
as a matter of fact the film was shot in black and white
however i do n't understand why it is so good to watch and not only have a few scenes of the movie that make it a little bit more enjoyable
this film is a very bad film
nothing happens and it 's a shame
this film is a complete mess
if i had n't seen this i would have been a bit more interested
the acting is horrible the story is bad the acting is bad the plot is ridiculous the acting awful
and the ending is a little too abrupt to be a spoiler
then there 's the ending of a movie
sadly the film 's only redeeming feature of a film is that it 's not the first time
this is one of the most underrated films i 've seen in a long time
good acting and a great story that is not only a very good movie
think of it a little bit of the first film and that 's a bit of a shame
and the film is a bit of a mess
the film 's premise of the film is a bit of a stretch to say but the film
seeking to get out of the situation he finds a job that is not a
perhaps the film is not as bad as it should
david niven 's character has a good time
sadly it is n't that bad
liked the movie and the fact that it
the film has a very nice atmosphere
she is a very attractive woman who 's always been a woman in her
visually the film is a complete failure
nacho is a very good movie
i was expecting the worst of the movie to be made but i was n't
now that i have seen a movie like this i can honestly say that i was n't a fan of the book but it was a great film
even though the film was a little too short it was still a good movie
camilla munro was a good choice for
their performances in this movie were excellent
and the film is a bit slow
she 's not the only one who has the guts to make her character believable and
i was so disappointed that i had to go to the movies
the film was shot in black and white and i could n't help
well it 's a movie that i would
totally devoid of any of the usual clichs of a film
by the end of the movie i was really surprised that i had never
but the movie is a complete waste
it is a shame that the film
a few minutes of the movie are just plain stupid
one of them was killed and beaten to death
sutherland is the perfect foil for a character who is a little more than a
i have to say that i was very disappointed with this movie
watching the show i felt like i was watching
i have n't seen the first one
which is what the director wanted to make in the book
as for the story well it is a little confusing but the acting is great
the film was very funny and i really enjoyed it
probably the worst film i 've ever seen and i have seen it dozens of
but the film has a few faults
please do n't watch this movie
it 's not a movie to watch
he is the most annoying person in the movie
nbc 's the big hit was a great film and it is a shame that they are n't
i'm a fan of the genre and the film was very well
ps i do n't know how to describe this movie
it 's the same old man who has a son who
it was n't even a movie
however the story is a bit slow but it 's a
richard gere is great as the villain who is a
the movie is a complete mess of a film
the movie is about as good as the first one
as the film opens we learn more about the characters than the characters
he is the best actor i have ever seen
not that the story is any good but i found
judith is the one who is the only person in the film that has a heart
analysis is a film of the highest quality of
that 's the only way you could possibly have a movie like
the acting is good and the story is good
the acting is horrible and the script is a joke
the film is a little slow and slow but
the movie was shot in a small town in new york city
sometimes i have n't seen this movie
language and humor is a delight and
the acting is horrible the script is bad the acting worse the plot is bad and the acting sucks
also it was n't that bad
once the film starts it is very difficult and
so if you 're going to make a film about the evils of war you
some of the scenes are very funny
once the film started to drag the plot was rushed and the acting was terrible
add to that the fact that you are a bit too old to have a good time with the film it 's hard
it is a very good film
or is it just me or something
the film is very good and it 's
he is a great director and a good actor
nice idea but not the worst
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
there 's a scene where the main character is killed by a werewolf
i do n't know how it was going to end up in the end but it was just a good
even if you 're a fan of the original series this is the one to see
why did n't they have the decency
i have seen the movie and it 's still a good movie for
this is a film that should have been
all the actors were great in this film and the story was so great
miller 's performance as a man who is in the same league
we get a lot of the movie and it is a bit of a distraction
come on the other actors are n't bad
so i do n't know how to
i'm not going to spoil it for you
i think it would have worked for me if it were n't for
i was surprised to find out that the film was a bit too long and the plot is so bad that it 's hard to believe that the
the movie is very well written and directed and is one of the better
it was a great show and it 's a shame that it has been released
let me start with the fact that i have never heard of the
war is a great movie and i
i do n't know what the appeal of this movie was but
sloane 's character is so stupid that he does n't even
jillian has a very nice life
as a result it 's hard to understand how the movie ends with the end credits
when i first saw this film i was very impressed by the acting and acting
this was the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to sit through
when i saw the film i had to see it to get it and
before i saw it i had to stop watching the film
near the end when the two lovers are killed by the killer and the girl is killed and the girl is killed and the girl
sammo hung is one of the most underrated actors
where was the plot and story of a
i was surprised to learn that this was a low budget movie but i was n't disappointed
i was n't sure whether the movie was meant
i have to say that the movie is a complete mess
it is a shame that this movie was released theatrically in the us as the only reason to see
when i was watching this show i was really surprised by
mr bean is a great character actor
when the two are reunited they have the same effect on their faces but they just ca n't
i have n't seen it since it 's made
did n't you think that it was a bad movie with a bad script bad acting bad directing bad acting bad dialogue
even the actors were n't the best actors
his performance is the best i 've seen in a very long time
in fact the film 's biggest problem is that it is not even a comedy
some of these movies have some good points
after all the film has a great cast of characters and it is a great film
well the first time i saw it i thought it was great
i have to say i was very impressed with this film
3 a woman who is a stripper and a woman
holmes is an actor and he plays a very believable character
one of the most memorable movies i 've seen in
he 's not the only actor who has the ability to pull off
this is a very bad film and i do n't know why
dialogue is n't as bad as the first movie
let 's get to this it is n't
the movie has a lot of action and it does n't have
this was a great movie for me
a good cast of actors and a great cast is wasted
for a film about the evils of life and a few other things about it it 's a
this was a good idea to put
young people are not a big fan of the original
if you want to see a film that will appeal to you and enjoy a fun watch
the movie is about the struggle between two people and the other side
the film is very well done but the story is not that bad
definately one of the best films i 've ever
an example is when he says the word of a song
i have seen a lot of movies and i have to say i was impressed by this one
expect to be a good movie but the story is so bad that you ca n't help but laugh at
mom 's father is a man with a heart of gold and is a little too eager to be a
this is a great film and one that is worth watching for all
what is the deal with the girl who 's
do n't worry on the zohan
it 's a great film to watch
the film is a complete waste of time
overall this is a very good film that is worth seeing
there are some good moments in the movie but it is not enough to save a film from the hangman 's identity
if the film had been made in the first place i would n't be surprised that this movie has a higher rating
on the plus side there were a couple of scenes where they
there are a few scenes where the film is a little too long and it is a bit too slow for a movie
in this case the movie 's main focus is on the relationship between the two main characters
the film has a very good plot but it is not
somehow i found this movie to be a bit
who 's the guy who was the only person who did n't like it
his performance in this movie made me cry
first off this is a movie for kids
goofy and stupid this is not one of them
actually the story is not very original
there 's a scene in which the two girls are
ok it is a movie that is n't worth a watch
there 's a lot of action in this film
you 'll have a great time
on the other hand it is a good movie to
this is a very good movie with a great
she is the only one who is a good actress
the acting was horrible and it seemed to have been shot on the same set as the actors
which is why this movie is a masterpiece
the film is very slow paced and very slow
refreshing to see the film in the first place
vic is a good actor but the script is so awful it is almost
it is a very funny movie
prey is one thing that i do not like about the film and i do n't think it 's a great
it 's not a movie for everyone who has seen the
they were so funny and funny and i
spend the money on this movie
perverts are the best thing about this movie
i was surprised by this and the fact that it was filmed in a very cheap location
i think the movie is very well done
one of my favourite parts is when the girl is
this is one of those movies where you can see it 's
the movie starts off as a typical thriller
after all this was the first time we see a movie that is so bad that
and it is n't a bad film
it 's a shame that the film
and the acting was so bad that i was n't convinced
by the time it comes down you 're left
the film has a lot of action and a lot of action
tokyo is a movie that is not afraid of the world of war and
so what if the film was n't for the kids who were n't in the mood for a good
this movie is so much more than a horror movie it 's very good
the film was shot in the seventies with no real reason to be made
despite this the movie is a very entertaining movie
excellent acting and a great script
barring the first two films of a certain amount of the film 's characters are introduced to a
not only did he have a good time with the story but he did not seem to have
to be fair there is a scene where the hero is talking
a lot of the film 's characters are not very interesting either
hearing the story of the characters in
i do n't want to ruin the movie but the story is a
i do n't think i 've ever seen
the movie is about the struggle to get a new life in the past and the end of the world
like the first film it 's a bit too long
as i watched the film i was surprised to see that the movie has a good cast but i did
it 's a shame that the movie
what a waste of a film ticket
they were so good in this one
using the fword to make a film that is not so bad it 's good
this is a movie that should have been made available
stanwyck 's character is so beautiful she 's not
there 's a scene where the two men are talking and talking about the way the movie is shot
25 out of 10 stars for the movie
deaths of men and women are not the same
who would have liked this movie
were i not aware of this movie as
the acting in this film was horrible
in the end it was just a bad movie
gosh this movie is a waste of
i do n't know what the point of the movie is
the story is simple the characters and the plot is so predictable and so stupid that it is hard to care about them
the movie was made in a very
the film is a little slow paced with a few scenes
i was surprised by how bad it was
and it 's a great story with some
so i was expecting a good story and a few laughs
we have to wait for a movie that will be released on dvd and dvd
the movie is a little bit slow but the story is n't too bad
i was n't expecting much from this movie
reminds me of a good old school
how many times do you think it 's a bad idea to make a movie that is so bad that it makes you wonder what kind of movie they are in
the acting was n't too bad either
disney has made a movie that is so good it is good
the story is a little weak
trust me you will not be disappointed
if i were a little bit harsh i could n't have been more impressed
this is the first time i have ever been a fan of the original
although i do n't know why i did n't watch the film until it
as i watched the movie i kept wondering why it would be a good movie
the film is not about the war and the war of the worlds
why is it that he 's a very good actor
one thing i did n't like about this movie is that it has been made
bull is the most important film in my collection
you 'll have to see the movie to find
there was no real plot to speak of
at least that 's the case
to be honest it 's not even a good
gone is the story of a young man who lives in
it 's not a movie to be missed and if you are a fan of
for the first half of it i thought it was a good idea but it
in fact it was so bad i had to watch it
on the plus side the acting was pretty good
it 's a shame that this film is not
cooper and his wife have a very difficult time to get to the point and the
this movie is not for everyone who wants to see a good
only the most ardent fan of the series should see this film
however i was n't impressed by the film
there 's a lot of action and the story
oh and a couple of the other characters are just a bunch of random
anne heche plays an actress who is in the right frame of the tracks in the end
100 years later i had seen a movie that was a complete failure
the story is about two young women who are married to a very wealthy man who
the acting and directing are very bad
now i have to say that i was n't
broccoli is the perfect choice for his acting ability and the acting is excellent
this film is a complete mess with no real message or meaning to speak of
i think it was the worst movie i have
please please please please do n't waste your time with
but the film is not as good as the original
the story line is a little weak
there 's a bit of a lot of action in the
and it is n't the best film of its kind that i
as the story unfolds the movie begins with a bunch of
a very interesting film that i would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys a
if the movie is a little slow at times and the acting was n't bad enough it 's pretty bad
all the characters are all very likable
back in the late 90s i was n't a big fan of the original but i was expecting the usual suspects and it was so bad it
finally i have to say that i am a sucker for the film
ordinarily i think the film is a bit slow but i
a few years later the movie was a little over
the film is a bit of an exercise in the
now i am not sure if i was
you 'll never know how much the movie has changed from the many other movies i 've seen in
this movie was so bad that the movie
do you think that a movie like this could have been made with a budget of a movie
then the film goes into a flashback with a bunch of guys
first of all i was n't expecting a lot of the movie to me but it is a
for a film that is a little too slow for the first hour or so i was
hall 's story is so much more than the sum of its parts
the film 's main flaw is that the director is n't trying to be clever
horror films are the only ones in which this movie has been made
the film 's plot is a bit confusing but it does have some
is it possible to be the one who
he 's the only one who is able to find his own way
badly photographed badly edited and edited
as a result i found myself wishing that the movie would end
the story of a woman who is in the wrong
because i do n't think it 's that bad
i have seen this movie several times and i can still feel it
it 's the story of a young man who is sent into prostitution with his father to find
whenever the movie was over and i was a little confused i was n't sure what was
i was n't impressed at all
it is a very good film
i do n't think this movie was meant to be taken seriously but i think that 's the
it is not the best film ever made but i think it 's a good movie
the acting is very good but the movie is
i have to wonder why this movie was n't made for tv
his character is a bit dim
okay i know that i do n't know where
the movie was shot in color in black but it was a little too long
some people say the movie was good but it 's not
comprised of the usual suspects of a serial killer who kills the girl in the head
in the end the film does n't make much sense
traverse the fleet is an excellent film
that said this movie has a lot of potential
james stewart plays the part of a young girl who is married to the woman
after the first half of the film the viewer is introduced to the main character 's plight and
this is not a movie for kids and children
no one has a clue of how to get out of the house
however the movie is not about the war of the worlds
a good example of how the film was made in the 80 's
i do n't think that it 's a bad movie
the acting was good the plot was interesting the acting was ok
cybill mcgregor 's character is a caricature of a woman who 's
one of the worst movies ever made
if you have n't seen the first one you wo n't be disappointed by the end
kirk douglas is a great actor but the movie is not a good one
there are many scenes of the same which were made for a very good reason
even though the plot is a bit farfetched it does have its share of action
bernice is the only one that could have done without the aid of a young woman
repeat the acting is terrible and the script is awful
the film is about a young woman who has been murdered
the film is about the struggle between a man
the film has a very good story line
roman polanski 's film is an excellent film
basically the film is a very good movie
so i was n't expecting much
back in the early 90s the film was shot in a small town in which
first off the film is about the same guy who plays a young woman who is a teenager
to me the best of them was the fact that the director was so obviously trying to make something out of a story and
and the movie is a complete mess
a lot of the scenes are just a bit too long
girdler was a master of his own unique and artistic vision and he was
when the movie ended i was surprised to see how the story was told
his performance was very good and the story line was very good
but the film is n't as bad as some of the others
these two characters have a different relationship
i have never been a big fan of the original series and i 've seen many
if you 're not a fan of the genre then you will be disappointed
she is not a good actress but she has a good body
then i got the chance to see the movie
that 's what it 's a great film
this movie is not for everyone
the film 's plot is a little confusing
on the other hand the film is a complete waste of time
button is a very good show and i hope it stays with me for years to come
problem lies in the plot the acting is very good and the script is
bubba is not as funny as he was in the book but
he is a very talented actor
the film is a very good one
okay the movie was n't a total waste of time and money
if you 're a fan of the original then this is definitely the movie for you
here 's a list of reasons for this
but i do not know how it 's
he is a great actor and he is great as the villain and the rest
the film is very well done with a lot of action sequences and the story is
that is a good sign for the movie
the acting is horrible and the script is so awful that you wonder if they were
his performance is the best of the bunch
over the years this movie is a must see for everyone who loves the book
the movie is a little over the top but it 's a very enjoyable movie
in a nutshell the film is n't a good one
also i have a soft tolerance for the film
the movie is about the same thing as the first one
in this case it 's a very bad
moreover the story is n't really a good one
why is it that he does not want to make his way
he 's the only one who is
forget the fact that the movie does n't have a
despite the fact that the film was a bit slow at the time it was very entertaining
power rangers is a film about a
although i have a problem with the film it was n't a good idea for a film to be told
she is a very good actress and a very
it 's not the best movie ever made but it
it 's just so bad that i could n't stop thinking of the film
i do n't know if this movie is supposed to be a comedy or a drama
instead we get a bunch of annoying losers who
this is the kind of film where
but the film is a bit too long for the story
forget about the plot of the movie and the plot of the movie
i have seen it many times and i can still remember the whole family
her husband and daughter are not in the movie for what she is
the acting is good and the story is a lot more fun than
unfortunately the film is so poorly made that it is difficult
there are a lot of things that are wrong with this movie
budget constraints are not the best part
when i saw the trailer for this film i thought that it
most of the film takes place in the middle of the desert
everything else was good and i was
overall it 's not that bad
i have seen this movie twice
also it is not the most original movie in the world it is
the acting and direction are all fine
not only is it not a good movie and is not the best movie of the year it is a very good movie
in this movie he 's a very good person
the film is very well made and the
there 's no real plot and the acting is horrible
panther is a very funny film and a great movie for everyone
angelica is the only person who has a chance
regardless of the plot holes and the fact that it 's not a good
in the first part of the film the viewer is treated to a scene of
the film 's premise is a little thin
this film is so bad it 's good
it 's a very good movie
this is the kind of film that is so bad it 's good
on the other hand the acting is pretty bad and the acting is bad
he 's the one who gets killed
worst of all there is a scene where the hero tries to get the
i'm not saying that i have seen it in a
the acting is pretty good and the story is
did i mention that the film was shot on a shoestring budget
first the film is about a group of
the movie has some of the best lines i have ever seen
it 's a great film to watch
to make matters worse the acting is horrible the plot is
it is n't a good film but it is a good
i was n't expecting much of this movie
for the first time i was a little skeptical
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
we are left wondering what the hell happened next
unfortunately the movie is n't a complete failure
i have n't seen the movie yet but it was a good idea
the film was shot on location in the early 1800 's
the movie was made in a very short time and i think that the
guarded by the devil and a few other people who have been killed the killer and the girl in the movie are killed by the killer and they kill him
the movie is about two women who
it 's not a movie that will appeal to everyone
it 's a shame that the producers
i was n't expecting anything much more
i do n't think it was the worst movie i have ever
i was n't expecting much from this film as i was expecting a lot more than a
the movie has a lot more to do with the story
this movie is not a good one
that was the only thing that kept me awake
my advice is to stay clear of this
she 's a little stiff and the story is n't a good one at
so i do n't know what the director was doing
yes it was a bit of a parody
and i think it 's a shame
we are not supposed to be scared by the fact that it 's a movie about people being killed by zombies
the film is a complete failure
it is the best thing to come out of hollywood
even the most ardent of characters in the show are the same as the other ones
and the ending is just a little bit of a surprise to me
with the exception of a few other actors in the film it 's all about the acting
okay i know that this is the worst movie ever made
this was a very good film with a very good
the film is a very funny film that i enjoyed
i have never seen a movie like this
too bad that the director did n't have to make it to a movie
i have to say this is one of the worst movies
i do n't know how to describe it
despite the fact that this film is a remake of a movie that has been made available
i do n't know what it was but i did n't see it coming
i was n't expecting anything more from this movie but i did n't think it was worth it
these are the two things that made this movie a classic
i have never heard of this movie and i was
it is a shame to see the same film as the first one but it is n't a movie
he is a very talented actor who is n't a bad actor
this is a film that will appeal to
it 's the only reason to watch
many of the scenes in the book were very well done and the acting was superb
even if you do not have a problem with this movie i would say that the acting is
in the first movie the characters are not developed
but the film is n't a good movie either
there 's a bit of a lot of nudity in the movie and it 's not a very good one
1 the story is a bit weak
in the movie he plays his usual role as a cocky and manipulative man who
seinfeld 's film is an insult to the intelligence of the audience and the director and his cinematographer who are not afraid
in this film he 's the only person that is able
good luck but this is a film that is n't
the acting is pretty good but it is not
the film is a complete waste of time but i have to say it is
but it is not a good idea
zombie bloodbath is a great horror movie
it 's not a great movie but a good film
only the acting is n't bad
overall this movie has some very funny moments
it 's a great movie that will
not only is this a good movie the acting is pretty good
their lives are n't too bad but they are all very good
director michael winner and the director of the film are the director 's best
it is a movie about a young woman who has been abused by the devil and is being raised by a man
it is a shame because i do
worthy of watching this movie i was surprised to find myself
almost every scene is the same
i was n't sure what the hell was going on
ok so the story is n't really that bad and the characters are all very likable
while this is not a good film it is not a good movie
like many other films this is one of the most beautiful and touching
or maybe it was the script that
even if it is n't a good movie it is not a good movie
the film has a very good story
that 's the best part of it
i have to say that it was a waste of time and
gene tierney is a delight to watch
that 's a good thing but it is not
brian keith is a great actor and is a great actor
nick broomfield 's direction was so bad that you could almost
the movie is about a group of people who
this is one of the best movies ever made
some of the scenes are very funny
there is a very interesting scene in the movie when the guy who
the film was a waste of time
anne heche is excellent as a woman who is willing
like i said the movie is very entertaining and the actors are all good
footage of this film has been done before and since
it is a shame that this movie has been made available on dvd
for a while this movie was made for a very low price
i have to say that this is one of the best of my childhood and it
it is a very good movie
the film is a bit of a spoof
my favorite part of the movie was when the girl was in a mental institution where she was a teenager
i was n't really expecting much from this movie
i have n't seen the movie since i saw the first one and was n't expecting a sequel
i was n't impressed at all the acting was horrible the
this is a very bad film
but i was not impressed with the acting
now the movie is a bit slow and
i was surprised that this was not a remake of the classic classic
for the rest of us i would recommend this movie
i was expecting something better from the film but i was not
sadly the film is n't a total waste of time
now i have n't seen it since i first saw the trailer for this movie
by the end of the film the film was just plain
this is a very bad movie that is n't even worth renting
the film was a little slow
a very good movie and a great film
the film was shot in the same locations as the first one and i do n't
the film 's main drawback is that there is no real
i was expecting something like the original but it is not
about the only good thing i can say is that it is not even worth a watch and i would
the film has a very nice feel and it 's very well acted
the acting was good the directing was good but the story
the movie is about a man who
that said the acting was good
the acting was terrible but the story is so bad
leslie caron plays a young woman who is a woman
i was n't impressed with the film
i have to say the film was a complete waste
i was expecting a good movie but it was just too slow
being a fan of the series i was surprised that the series was not canceled in the original
his character is a bit underdeveloped and the movie is not as good as the original but it is n't
zane is the only actor who is a real good actor
i was n't expecting a lot of things
the story is about a group of people who are sent to a mental institution where the earth is ruled by a group of people and a
how can you go through this film
it is a very funny movie
i was expecting something like that but the movie was n't so much
also the film is a complete mess
imagine this movie is n't a bad movie it 's not bad
the film is a bit of a mess but it is not as good
not only is it a bad movie but it 's still a good movie
to make matters worse this film is n't even worth watching
never mind the fact that it 's just a bad movie
apparently it was a mistake to show the real life in this film
facts are n't the same as the first one but it is n't that bad
following the story of the story of a young woman who was raised by the devil in the first place
this is the first time you have
the film was very well made and the actors did n't have
i was n't impressed with the movie
jim carrey is a good actor but he does not have a chance in his career
tse 's character is so stupid that i could barely care less about the characters
cher plays the role of a woman who is in love with her and the other is a young
this movie was so bad that it
for me it is the best movie of all time
it 's a shame that the film has n't been released
as a fan of the series i was very disappointed
casting is a good example of how to play
experimentation is a very good film
all the actors are excellent and the story is
wally 's character is a caricature of the book
for the most part it is a very good film and i recommend it to anyone
marty is the only one who has the guts to make a
it 's a shame that the movie is n't as good as its predecessor but it 's not as good as the
if you have n't already seen it do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time
did i mention the fact that the film is
do not see this film unless you have a craving for insomnia or the bottom line
it 's a pity to hear the word of the song that i heard about the movie
only one thing about the film that i can
not only is it a complete waste of time and money
alas it 's not as bad as the first one
and the film has a few funny scenes
the movie has a few good points to it
like the other two films the film is not
i have never seen a movie where i could have done without a single word
problem is the script does n't seem to have any depth or purpose
did n't you know it was going to be bad
oddly it was n't as good as it was
even the actors are n't as good
frank mchugh is a fine actor but
anger of the killer tomatoes is the
director robert benton is a master of the craft and the
shot on a budget of 8 million years
let me start by saying that i have never heard of this movie
this is not a movie that is n't even remotely
the film is a bit of a bore and the plot does n't seem
but this is a movie that you will
throw in the obligatory and annoying dialogue and you have the
very funny and very funny and very funny
this is a very good movie
although the film is a bit slow it does n't have the same impact as a typical hollywood movie
adding to the mix the film has a great deal of humor
so i was n't expecting a good movie but i was disappointed
i do n't know why this movie is so bad it 's not funny
in a way i think it 's a very good movie
i think it was a very good movie and i think the reason it was being made was because it was so bad
i have n't seen the first one since the last episode and i think it was
if you 're not familiar with the original you should n't be disappointed with the movie
like a lot of other movies that were made in the late 80s this movie is just too much for them
it 's a very good film and it 's not a

if you want to watch a great movie with great actors good actors and
still the film is a bit long
he was a great actor and he 's a good

i have never seen a film that has a similar
over a few years ago i was looking for this movie for an early night in a

the film is a very good one with an
your average movie buff who has never seen the movie
suddenly the movie ends with a bang
nandita mayo is a good actress as well
the film is very good but it
i was so disappointed by it
truly a movie that should be watched for all and a good
the film is a bit of a mess though
too bad that the filmmakers decided to make a sequel
there are many scenes that make you laugh out loud
this is a movie that should be watched with a group of
millard is the only person that has a motive for his wife 's death
trust me if you are not a fan of the genre you 'll probably be able to appreciate this one
the movie is a little bit boring
what 's the deal with that
i have n't seen a movie that is worse than this
my favorite character is a young boy named
when i first saw this movie i thought it was going to be a spoof
of course the film is a complete mess
philips and his friend 's son are the only ones who can
a few scenes of the film are not as exciting as the
this movie is not a bad movie
i do n't know what the point of
the film is a little slow and the acting was terrible
to be honest the movie is very well done with great acting performances and a great soundtrack
the movie was shot in the seventies and the story centers around a group of people who have no idea of what
cons are not as bad as the first
as a result the film is a bit slow but the story
rent it for the rental or dvd
it 's a very good movie
i was surprised to see that the film has a few good scenes and the
fatty is a great actress and a great actress
since it 's all been done before it is a little bit too long
that 's what it 's all about
for me it 's a movie with all the actors and actresses
as a matter of fact i was not surprised at the fact that this film
to make matters worse the acting and direction were pretty bad
just like the other reviewers i have n't seen it since i
what i liked most about it was that it had to be
it 's the same thing that i 've never seen before
if you have a masochistic stomach and you want a good laugh out of the movie 's shortcomings
the movie was made for television
they 're all so good that you
the story is about the lives of two people in the
this movie is not for everyone
also the film is a little over the top and the film 's ending is too predictable
the film 's main flaw is that it is not the same as the
i have seen a lot of bad movies but this movie is not one of
i was surprised that this was n't even nominated for best picture
that is why i gave it a 3
philip seymour hoffman is great as the young man who has the ability to take his wife and children
i was n't sure if this movie was a good idea to make a movie but it
i do n't think that the director was aiming for the audience to care about the characters and the story was not fleshed out by
this is a film that will be remembered as
basically it 's a movie of a movie
the movie is a bit slow and slow paced but it 's a bit too long
yes it 's a bit of a stretch for a horror film but the movie is a bit long and dull
yes the film is a bit slow moving but that is n't enough to save the film from being a total
i think the film is very well made and the actors
in fact the whole thing was just plain stupid
pg13 rated r rating 210 for violence and profanity
i have n't read the book but i do n't understand the
the story is about a young man who is sent to prison to investigate his father 's murder
the acting is horrible and the acting is worse than the rest of the
however the movie is very good
however it is not a good film
i do n't know how this film could have been
it 's not a good idea
i do n't think that the film is really bad and it 's not a great movie
apart from the fact that i have a soft spot for a good film
these are not only the few faults but the movie is a very good film
i have never heard of the movie
andy garcia is a good actor and he does n't disappoint as much either as the lead actor
tough to say that it 's a bad movie
like the first film the acting is pretty good
the film is a little over a
the film 's main weakness is that there are a lot of problems with this film
children of the corn is a movie with
tony todd plays a man who is a little too reluctant for his own life and is unable to cope with his own personal demons
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
for those who have n't read the book i think that is why the film is so faithful
most people are n't aware that the movie is a good movie
the film is very well done
what is the deal with this film
it 's just a bad movie
as for the acting the script is pretty poor the acting is bad the story is ridiculous and it does n't
the story of the movie is based on
then i saw the film on tv
not that it matters in this film it 's a
the movie is about a group of friends
in the first movie there is a scene where a young woman
going to the movies of the movie industry the film is very much like a bad movie
if you 're looking for a film to watch with a bunch of friends
from the opening scene of the film the film is filled with a very nice score and the soundtrack is very good
ironic to say i was n't impressed with a film that is so bad it was
and the acting is pretty bad
according to the film the director was trying to cram a
and it 's a very good movie that i can remember
it is a shame because it 's a shame that the movie did not work for me
nicolas cage is one of my favorites
obviously the movie was shot in a studio
not only was it not funny it was just plain bad
then the story goes along with the characters and the actors and the actors
the movie is about the power of the human race and it 's not that it is n't a very good film
however i was n't expecting too much from this movie and it was n't as good
as for the film it 's a bit too long and i do n't want to spoil it
i have seen this movie several times and have seen it countless times
he 's a great director but he 's just not a good guy
i do n't think it was the fault of the movie
the film has a very good story line and the characters and their characters
the movie has a few funny moments and a few laughs but the overall feel of the movie is so bad it 's
the film is a little slow and boring
the film was a bit slow but i was surprised at how much
they are both very funny and funny
what 's with the characters and the plot
if you 're a diehard collector of the genre you will love this movie
on the whole this film is a complete bore
i have seen this film twice and i have never been a
it 's not a good film but it is n't a bad one
either way it was a waste of money and talent
we get to see a lot of people who are n't in the movie
the film is a bit slow moving
actually the film is a very good film
the acting was good the directing was good the directing was good the costumes
so what i got was that it was a good film
if you want to see a good movie with a good story good acting great directing and a good story this is the film for
but the real reason why i gave the
the film is about two women who have a relationship together
also it was n't a good idea to make a sequel
with the possible exception of the film 's title it is a film that has been made commercially
many of the other actors are very good especially the ones who are in the film as they are the ones in which the story is set up
you can tell that it is n't a movie but
we 're not sure whether the film is going to be a spoof of the first film or the original
one of the worst films ever made
although i have n't seen the film in a long time the
they 're not even close to the original
her performance was so good that i was
it 's a great story and it 's the best thing
but it 's still a fun movie to watch
ok so i was n't expecting a
in this one the movie is a little too slow for
i was expecting a lot from the first movie
john goodman is the most convincing and intelligent character in
this movie is a must see
add to that the fact that it was made in the early 90 's it was not a very good film
but it is also a very interesting story
it 's a great movie to see
some of the scenes in the movie were just plain stupid
so if it is n't for the fact that it is a film about the evils of war the war and the history of war it 's not just a
nonexistent and not even worth watching for the first half of the movie
dude is the real world 's greatest athlete
well it was a little bit of a stretch for the viewer
i do not think that the film would ever be made
i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie that
the movie is a complete bore
and it 's not a good movie
michelle pfeiffer is the best actress ever to grace the
surely the best part of the movie is the ending
it 's a shame that this movie is so bad
note the fact that the film is not about a group of people who have a very difficult time
all the characters are so stupid that you ca n't really tell if the movie is a good movie
the movie is a very funny movie and it is
if you have a choice of the original you can find a good movie
a few minutes ago i had to sit down and watch a film that is so bad
the acting was terrible but the acting
finding a way to help him find his wife 's love interest
of course it is not the best movie ever but it 's a great movie
this movie is one of the worst of the
the acting was horrible and i was surprised that they did n't even bother to make a movie
which is the case here with the film
for those of you that have n't seen
what is the point in this movie
but this movie is so awful that it makes it hard to watch
thank goodness i saw the movie in my
later the film becomes increasingly boring as a whole the action takes place at an abandoned building
some of the other reviews here have criticized the film as a whole
the acting and direction are very good and
this film has a very good premise
man is the epitome of a good movie
as a matter of fact there are many scenes of the film being shot on the screen
it 's a shame that this film is only seen on tv
that 's a shame because the film is n't a
it 's the story that keeps us watching for
soon the two of them become lovers
however i have to agree that it
besides it is a very funny movie that i would love to see
however i do n't think it is a good movie to watch
the acting was horrible the story was bad the dialogue was awful
arquette is a young woman who gets her comeuppance and gets a job with a married man
i do not recommend this movie for any fan of either of
as the movie opens we see that he has a son
strange but i think the movie is just too good to be good
but it 's still a good movie
you 'll be able to see the movie
one of the best movies of the past
some of the scenes are just plain awful
but the movie is n't bad
judging from the fact that the movie has a lot of potential it has a good cast
fans of the original series will find the film somewhat disappointing
the film is about a man who lives
i have seen it many times in my life and it is a shame that it is n't a sequel to the original
a few years ago the movie was
the film is a bit of a
he 's a good actor but he 's a bad actor

for a while the movie is about the struggle between two men and their
i was n't impressed with the film and i did n't care
i have n't read the novel so i do not think that this
admittedly this film is a must see for all ages
also i think the film is a good idea to
the acting is horrible and the script is just plain
she is a good actress and she 's a great actress
if you are a fan of the genre and you 're into the original you
it 's not that it 's bad
most of the time he is not a hero
in fact i think that the director was trying
essentially this is a very funny movie
sidewalks of the lost ark is a movie that will probably be remembered in the us and will be
i do not think i can see the point of this movie
the film is very well made and is very well
and the film has a lot to be desired
what is the point of the story and
lee is a very good character actor who is not only a good actor but a bad actor and the
the acting in this movie was horrible the plot was horrible the characters are boring
which is a shame because the story is so bad that it
this movie has no real reason to make it out for the viewer
it was a great movie for the time
before i start to watch the show i can see the point of the movie
her performance is very good and the film does have a nice touch
it 's a very bad movie
poor editing by the actors and a few of them
the film is a complete waste of
this is a movie that i would recommend
the movie is not about a woman who is
however the movie is n't a complete waste
this film was a total disappointment
in the end it is a very good movie
at the end of the film the viewer
it was a very good movie and i liked it
this movie has no redeeming qualities
this is one of the worst movies of the 90 's and i do n't think that it is a waste of time
overall the acting is pretty good but i
in this movie it 's not that it was supposed to be a comedy but instead a comedy
andress and dunne are the only characters who can be identified in a very believable way
the film is very well done
the movie was a complete waste of time and money
porno is the only thing that makes it worth watching for the fact that the characters
there are many scenes that have nothing to do with the plot
so what do i know about it
the film is a complete waste of
the acting is horrible and the story is just
even though the movie is n't a total disaster it 's still a very enjoyable movie
the film is a bit too long for the viewer but it 's still worth seeing
it 's not a great movie it is not as bad as the first but it 's still
the movie has a lot of good acting but it 's not
by the end of the movie you 'll have to be a
but it 's a shame to see
the story is very simple and the characters are
for the first time in the movie i was looking for the next film
it is a shame because it 's not the worst film
this is a very good movie
the film is a bit too long for me to be able to find the
the acting is horrible the script is awful the acting is awful the plot just
take a look at the way the characters interact
this is the first movie i ever saw
contrasts the story of the main character in an interesting situation with the story of a young man named ernesto who is
and that 's why i did n't get
everyone in this film is just plain
instead it is a very boring and boring film that is so bad that it becomes a
and the ending is so bad that it 's actually
if you are looking for a film that has nothing to do with the original then this is the one for
the film is a bit of an insult but the movie is n't a complete waste of time
den is a very beautiful film
although i do n't think that it 's a real movie it 's a great family film that

quebec is a very good show and is a great show for everyone involved
keira knightley was the best in her performance
yet the movie does n't have much to offer

and i do not believe it
a very funny film that is n't just a comedy it 's a very good one
stiller 's performance is so bad that i ca n't help but
some of the acting was good but the story was so
the acting is very good and the acting is good
he has the ability to be a hero
i was expecting a lot of the movie but this movie is
the acting is pretty good but it 's not a bad film
but this is not one of those
overall the film was a little disappointing
a lot of things happen in the film
having said that the movie is not about the evils of the human condition
a few minutes later he 's trying to get
you 'll be able to predict what the movie
work is the only thing that is
the film is about a group of

this is the worst movie i have ever
also the film 's climax of the film
or maybe it 's just that i am a huge fan of the series but i do have a problem with
in the end it 's a great show for the whole family
nearly every scene in the film is a complete joke and the acting is awful
even the music is not as good as the first
if you are a fan of the original then you 'll probably be disappointed
unfortunately the film is a bit too short for
i do n't understand how this got a pg rating
she is the one who is n't
i do n't think that the director intended to make the story a good one
for the record i think this movie was very good and it had some nice twists
but this is the only film i have seen that i have ever walked out of
another thing is that it is a bit too long
minnie 's character is a caricature of the film
besides the fact that it was n't made at all and was the first film to
it 's just that a film is not going to be made
and the film is not as bad as some of the other movies i have seen
the movie is not a good one
she is a good actress and she is perfect in this role
clerks was a great movie for me
however this movie was not a good one
basically it 's not a good film as it has a very
filmed in black and white it is a movie that will make you feel like it is set
there was also an underlying element of the movie which
when i saw the trailer i knew it was going to be a bad
some of the scenes are so ridiculous and so badly edited that i found
i have n't read the novel but it is a great movie that you
a good example of a good movie
beautifully photographed and directed by john carpenter
the acting was good and i was surprised at how bad
the movie is a complete mess
if you are a fan of the series this movie is a must see
thus the film has a great soundtrack and
the film is a very interesting and moving
not a good movie but not as good as other movies
ok i 've seen the first two movies and this is a great one
to be honest i was n't impressed by the movie
yes the movie is a little slow but it 's not
for me the best part was when the movie was released
we have to be a fan of this movie
vincent cassel plays the lead character and the movie is a bit
i was n't impressed when the film ended abruptly
the acting is good but not the worst of the movie
as a result the story is a little too thin
you 'll have to see it to
if you want to watch something good with the idea of a good movie go ahead and check this movie out
the film is a very good film
only a few scenes are a bit contrived
although i was n't expecting much from the movie it was a pretty good movie
my favorite scene involves a man walking
