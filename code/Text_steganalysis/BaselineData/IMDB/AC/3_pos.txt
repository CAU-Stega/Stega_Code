sadly the script does n't seem to have developed a purpose and the characters are so unlikable that you ca n't help but feel sympathy and care
the film is a very very very bad movie that 's not even worth renting the dvd
sigh i am very impressed with the
he is an extremely talented actor and is very good
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
instead it shows what a great artist he is in the movie business
i do not know how to do it
he is a master actor of a film he is a master of the industry
it was so bad i almost forgot it was just a bunch of kids who were n't laughing at it
come on you do n't have to be a fan to be able to sit in awe to
this film is a very good film with excellent actors and great supporting roles but this is a very poor movie
the film has a very nice score to accompany the mood and the acting
stimulated the movie to get the oscar nomination of the first film
sometimes it seems a little too long and the characters in general are n't very likable either

proving i have been in this movie for years
you can read the other comments by people who do n't like them
some of the scenes are really really bad
but it is not a film of all things
worse than this is the fact that the
kudos to director michael cimino for trying the first
now the plot is n't really that simple and i did n't care for the character development
one of them is in the movie that she
the film is a bit dated
and the acting is n't very bad
yes it 's a bit of a bore but i have n't been afraid that the film will
and that 's not a bad thing
this movie is a very entertaining movie and a mustsee if you want
she was so bad that i wanted to see her in her underwear in the shower
instead of watching the show we learn that a lot of people have n't been killed and are n't
many people have said the film is a complete waste of
it is a great show and a good one
it also does not make any difference
interestingly i had the privilege of viewing my local video rental for sale as a child and
he is a very talented actress in the movie
this is a very bad movie
ultimately they have to be a bunch
mark hamill is a good actor but he 's not as good in either the role
the film 's only flaw is to have a little more of a plot line
casting is also great as the two leads and a couple of memorable
imagine what it 's all about
and i do n't know what i was talking about because i was in for a big disappointment
i would have loved to have seen more of the characters in the film
overall though i have to give it a
dennis quaid plays a very complex character
i think this should be a classic film
i have been in for two months so that i can watch this movie over
overall it was not a total waste
i'm a fan of movies that are made by people who have not had a chance to see this movie
he has a lot more to say about this film than he should
the only thing missing was the use of the soundtrack
this movie is not worth renting on my
it was just the worst movie i have ever seen
most of these were n't the ones who were trying to do a little research to be funny but it was not the way to make it
it is a great movie and one
i was hoping for some sort of closure to the film but i was
cut to the dvd extras and extras of this movie
finally the movie ends with a twist
mighty peking man was a really cool
normally the acting was n't as bad as in the first part but it was a very good movie
i 've heard that this was a movie that had to be made by amateurs but that did n't make sense
when i saw the movie the first time i had heard about it and found my own copy of the movie
just like in my case of that
implausible and predictable with a bit of the same old stuff
after a few episodes of that season of season one i thought that was one of the best
the story is very simple and i was expecting something more from a movie
much of his movies have n't been done before
really it is not as bad as the first movie but the one with a
if you like watching a movie about a bunch of friends who are trapped in a world where people do n't know what they 're
i am not sure if it was made by a junior or b school
the film is not as good as
as i said before the plot is very predictable
the acting ranges from good to mediocre to downright awful
absolutely one of the greatest horror films ever
but if you are into the whole movie you 'll have a
great movie for everyone who has ever been in a military school
so what is the meaning for this movie
all of the actors were very good but the script
it 's all a matter of the word for a movie
i was very excited about the movie
i have to say i was impressed
spoilers ahead there 's a few things to say about this movie
so many of them have been given a chance to be the next film they were going
this movie is just plain awful
i have to admit that i did not have the pleasure of watching this film
on the one hand it 's an enjoyable little movie with a
i'm not a fan of this type of genre but i can forgive it as a whole not for the good of the masses
i 've been watching it countless times since i was
historically the movie is not so well done as a tv show
overall it 's an excellent and entertaining experience
like in all of the movies he has done it 's time to make it easier to make the mistake of being a great filmmaker
the movie does n't even try to go with the book but it is n't the worst either
spoiler alert spoilers the first movie was a bit confusing but the plot was so predictable and so lame
so what 's the point of this movie
the acting is good and there are some funny scenes in the movie
you have the ingredients that were so good that they did n't have to be done with the movie
there is an interesting reason to give the movie the benefit of the doubt but there was a very good
i do n't think i 've ever heard anything about it
it 's a shame because there were a few moments that could easily be shortened
i was so excited to see this movie on a whim of
thanks to the fine supporting cast of supporting actors
that 's what i would have done a great time to do something else
in the end i was left wondering where the real sympathies were going
here the cast is great and it is difficult to

i saw this film when i had a friend who was in the mood for a
a good movie to be seen and
i saw this movie on tv when i was about 6 years
i would n't be surprised if i had a good movie
the acting and direction are so bad and the acting is so bad
anyone who does n't like it will find an extremely annoying and unnecessary story about the war between
or maybe the film is a little too short
please please let me give it a 10
for example the scene with the giant critter and a little girl getting shot is a little overdone and the movie
it is n't that great at all and the movie is just plain bad
while the film itself does n't make much of an attempt to make it into a movie it 's not a complete waste of time
bizarre is the only thing that is n't quite funny
and the film is not as good as some
a movie that i would recommend watching it with the right people
the movie does a pretty good job of showing a little romance between the characters and the actors who were
as a matter of fact i was n't really expecting
the story itself is about a woman who is engaged
the plot of the story is simple the characters are n't developed enough to develop a relationship between two men but the film is very entertaining
on this level there is some great action sequences and the action sequences were quite good
all the characters in the movie are very interesting and there is a lot of action and action that
in a scene where they find an attractive
also the scene in the middle where the father was
then the movie is over and they 're all about to be taken with them
let 's not forget the last scene with the main character

however i found the acting pretty good and the script was a very entertaining and interesting story
why did they need to do that
routine is a very good movie with a very nice cast
as a fan of the original i was impressed with the story
yet it was a little too short and for me it was a good idea that it could be made in the
sidekicks have to have a good time to do so
i do n't know how to make movies
boris karloff is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
the film also shows the difference between two people in the film and that it is not only a very important thing that they
that was not what i expected but it was n't
i do n't know why the movie was released on dvd but it is not a complete copy
the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the actors were so
i'm not sure why it is so bad
trying to find it is not the worst movie i have ever seen
as a result of the fact that the film is based on
that 's what you would have to say when the film is set in a very

for some reason they are both very good looking and have a great body
anderson has the best lines of the entire film and has the ability to deliver a great
technically it was a very good movie
i would n't be surprised when the director of his own
at first you have a hard time figuring out how to end the movie
this is the best film ever made
ever since i have seen this movie i have n't been surprised at the lack of depth of the story
coleman 's performance is also very convincing
we are told to watch this film in a theater
even if the characters do not work in the movie they do not make sense
after seeing the movie it was a very enjoyable and touching film
there were so many things that happened in life that would make
it 's not so much in the
the film was directed by the legendary director costagavras but the acting in
i'm afraid that it was just the same movie and was n't funny
it 's not a movie that 's supposed to appeal to you
well i have to admit i was n't a fan of a film
but i would n't have given this movie
it 's a very good film
action is a good thing that is so good in this movie as you can see it for
preminger 's character is a bit of a caricature as his character was so much better with the character he was supposed to play and
being a fan of the original phantasm i have seen a lot of horror films but this one did n't
some of the other reviews have pointed out the ending but i have to say i have never heard of this film
meanwhile the film is a bit slow and slow in the end
how can you go to see such a great movie
i have seen all of this movie
technically though a very enjoyable film
after seeing this i had to say that the story is so good it is n't a good thing
i saw this movie for the first time in my childhood and loved it as much as the next

this is the worst movie i have ever
blurred with the most famous film ever made it
i 've seen a lot of bad movies and there is something worse
the only reason i watched this movie was because the movie 's title is n't as bad as it sounds
this is a good family movie and that 's a shame because it
liza minelli 's character is a caricature
while this movie was not good it was not a movie to me i 'd say it is the best movie i 've
fortunately i found it to be a rather dull
remember this movie is a remake of the first and the second
the acting is terrible the directing is awful and the special effects are so fake and laughable that it actually makes the film a bit campy
she is a good actor who does well to her
okay so if you do not believe the movie and you 're looking for a great film i would advise anyone who likes this one
most of the time the characters were too busy behaving like a real life and
like many of the comments on this forum i 've read a lot
try to find something better on screen with
daniel daylewis is perfect as the villain who plays himself in the film and he is the most convincing actor
i was n't disappointed to say so
ummm the story is just a bit too thin for the viewer
in fact the film has no substance or reason
just as they should have been the one i did
that is a shame that this show
mom and son are a bit too much of a societal and
however the film also shows the audience
that is not what this film does
i 've never seen such a great cast
the script is not very original either
the acting and direction in this film are so bad it hurts me that a film can be made
although the film is n't very good the acting is n't bad and there 's even little blood in it
yes i know it was a big budget film but that 's all this movie
there is an attempt at a film to be made in the first place
the movie is a little bit of a disappointment
there is no real reason why the director is the
the film is an utter failure to look at
i 've always loved it and i was
anyone who has seen it should be able to get into the mindset of the story and its
there 's a very good reason for watching this film
good movie for everyone involved in making this
as for the acting i would n't call it bad
if i had to give the movie a chance i 'd have been better
the story is about the adventures of the two friends
all the elements are so bad the movie is just boring
the film 's plot is simple the characters are likable and the script has a strong and believable ending
you have an eightyearold woman in love with a woman who lives in a village and
all the other elements are not very interesting
some parts were so much that you 'd want it in the beginning with a few twists and turns that you can relate to
listen to his music and dance in a very
vera morton is excellent as the mother who 's been a little over the top for some time but she 's also not too young
the film has a very good plot and very believable characters
the film is a very good film
the movie is just so poorly done i ca n't even begin to describe how bad a movie is
this has to be the best and funniest film i have seen in a long time
the script of the movie is quite interesting the story has
the movie does n't make any sense
he 's just too much for the role to be believable
this movie is so bad it 's
that is why this film is so great to watch
the first part of the film deals with
anyone who is interested in watching this movie should be aware of it 's a complete waste of time
i am surprised that such a talented cast and

he has a knack for making the movie a little bit more than just
if you want to watch the movie and watch it for what it is a great
he was also a very good actor who was not in the same league and
bad acting bad directing bad editing bad music
the only thing to have in the
dr the dragon is an odd and creepy film
i 've read the other comments here but i think it 's a good one to watch as if it were not for the fainthearted
it was n't so bad it was n't
in the first scene the girl is kidnapped in a hospital and the scene is a little long
think of a few good ones
even the soundtrack was awful the music was annoying the acting was horrible the music was bad the acting was worse than the script and the
he plays the role he is the perfect choice
it 's not even a movie for everyone and i do n't think the movie is a masterpiece it 's a total waste of
and it 's so obvious that you 're watching a movie that is actually quite entertaining
essentially there is a lot of action
i would have liked to see a more convincing film
unfortunately the movie is n't worth the trouble
the acting is good and the plot line is good and
i would n't say that there is no point to these characters
he has been the smartest person for a long time so this is a very
the film is a very entertaining movie
the plot twists were so predictable and predictable that it could easily be avoided by any selfrespecting viewer
he is n't in any way provoke the ability to convey a sense
there is a scene of some kind of sexual
and the scene where the killer was shot is a bit of a joke
colbert is not as good as the first
scriptwise i do n't think i could
some of this movie 's humor is n't that funny
this film is a very bad and boring mess and i have nothing
the story is not bad and the actors are not bad but not that
it has a nice touch to it but i
will they survive or die for the rest of the movie
in a way he was n't the first person he

if i had the opportunity to see it again i would probably be in for
and i am sure that this movie is not a
there are a few good scenes in this movie and i 'll tell you that the movie is very bad
i am a bit of a fan and
as a movie this is a good example of the genre and it 's not
the only good thing i got out of this
this is a film which i highly encourage you to watch over and over again
best of all i have to say that this was one of the best movies i have ever seen
in fact the whole movie is so stupid that it is impossible to get
but the film is n't a complete success
nearly every scene is a joke
but this is what it means
and i do not think that this film has any redeeming qualities
do we really need to be able to
i saw a sneak preview of the first film and
it 's not that great either
well the movie was n't so bad
makes you want to know more about your own life and what you can do
but it is still a very entertaining film that will appeal to those
i have no idea who is doing that
this was a very good movie with a very good story
first let 's talk about the movie it 's not
and it is a shame it is n't a sequel as
you 'll see the ending of this movie
first there are several of them in the film that are so much better than the movie
this film is not a complete mess
the story is a simple one
but the fact that i was n't really
but then again i 've seen all of the other comments here
he 's an actor who does n't seem to
taye diggs is a good actor as the lead character
jay leno does a good job but he was n't really in the movie
but it was still a little disappointing to see
really it 's a good movie but it 's very
the film was shot in the late seventies
or even in one of the other reviews of the film and the fact that the director is n't really the director of the story
of course i am sure the writers and directors did n't get much of the film
the film was n't as good as a lot of the other films
it is the story of a man who lives in a small apartment in his life his family and friends
the only thing i did n't like about this was the fact that it was made in the early 80s in the late seventies
wow it 's not as bad as
sharmila tagore was a bit of a jerk in this movie
i saw this movie on the sundance channel and it sounded like it was going to be something that i had imagined and i had no idea where i was watching the whole thing
while i do not agree with the reviewer it 's not a very good movie
while the plot is a bit farfetched it 's not too bad for the most part
logic is a little off the beaten path to be a horror film
yeah i know there is something wrong with that one
the story is not very well told and it 's just not enough to save it
lincoln has a very small screen presence and is a very convincing character that will never have a chance to become an actress
no i think the director did a great
the only thing that makes this movie worthwhile is when it comes out on
he 's not only an action hero but it is an action movie
it 's like watching a movie that is just too slow
synopsis of the movie was the same
very disappointing and a very very good movie
i would have given the movie the benefit of the doubt
you have to be a little hard to get through this
technically the film has some redeeming features and i would recommend this
find a copy of the movie and watch that
the film has some interesting moments and is a good
okay i know this is a low budget film
any movie about the holocaust or even
dwight frye was a good actor and i have seen him in a movie that
he 's the only one who knows what he does and he 's really funny
film is a very bad film
the film is a real bore
all in all an excellent movie
it is a shame that the writers of the movie have made
the script is full of clichs and the acting is awful
i'm surprised that the director and writer did n't get the rights to a higher profile
although the script was n't very bad it was a little too long
now i 've seen a lot worse
i have never seen such a bad film
is this film supposed to be based on
there is a lot of the usual action scenes and the characters are all very real
i 've always been fascinated by the fact that this is an excellent film
do n't worry about this movie
cheadle is also great and he 's great in it
the story is very interesting and has some great twists and turns
so the story is not as complicated as in
the film is about a young couple who get caught up
whoever made this movie should n't be ashamed of themselves
and then there was the ending
one scene where he says he is a woman with the words is one of the best in
but it does n't even matter to me
okay i do n't have the words for
spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers this movie is about as much fun to watch
a very enjoyable and interesting account of the life of one of the finest people in the history of cinema
but i did n't have to pay for it
how many times can you say
the movie also had a very nice soundtrack
if the producers had to choose between them i would n't have given it a chance
this film has nothing to do with the book
when the first film ended was one of the most controversial of the 90 's i had to see what i 'd heard
randolph scott 's character is a bit dim and it is not difficult for him to make a movie that is not only the funniest movie he
daylewis was the best part of the movie
next time we see the movie we see the same old man who is the only one in the film who is the father of the young man
those who enjoy this show will probably enjoy it
you will see him as well as his
rush away from the film and then get it out of the way
despite the fact that this movie was made by the critics and the other critics in the cast list i must say
the only way the audience can see is the scene
i have been in high school since childhood and i have seen it over and over again and again and still remember the titans
the first time i saw this film i was not impressed
the movie is very slow paced and is a complete waste of time
gilbert roshan is also a good actor
the story is n't too bad but there is nothing new and it 's not that bad
during the first half of this film the viewer does n't care for any of
more importantly i could see what the director was trying to
i was surprised to find such a bad movie i was n't disappointed
frankly i do n't think i 've ever seen the movie
rudy vallee plays a very convincing character who is always the only one that can make up a fight
a lot of the dialogue is just
pooja has no problems with her
martin sheen is excellent as the villain and he plays a nice guy in this
thank god that the last one was so disappointing
even though the acting was n't all that great it 's not really bad
a very good example of what happens when the film goes
i think it 's one of the best movies i 've ever seen it was a great film
accidentally the two are reunited with each other
the plot of the movie is just plain stupid
with that said i did n't know what to expect
patton is the only one who can do that
the plot is pretty much all of a sudden rip offs of a mad mad mad scientist and the beast and it is a little slow paced and a little slow
the movie was shot in new zealand but it was a very good movie for its day in which i have been a little jaded and i can see it in my head and that the people in it are very well done
harry potter and matt clark were very good in this movie
films like this are not the case in this one
while a good movie is not about the effects i would have expected that a lot of them were not just the same actors who had to play in this movie
i am sure there are more reasons for why the two main characters
i think this film is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
highly recommended for lovers of italian literature
i think that the film was shot in a very small budget and a lot of it would have been so
now this is not one of the best films ever it 's a movie that should have been made
shia labeouf is the perfect choice for her part in this
whether or not you can watch it you will probably be bored out of their mind
although the characters are not developed in the film the plot is very contrived
erm the movie was n't that horrible but it was
it 's the story of three brothers who live together in a small farmhouse and are
this is a must see for anyone interested in film history or for the sheer enjoyment in the art of acting
could n't they just have had some sort
from the beginning this film is just awful
many people think that this is a good movie and should
just because they were all of a more interesting or more important
the story is very basic and predictable
the only saving grace to it is that it was shot in new york
starring the great christopher plummer as the lead
penelope raines as the heroine of the film is wonderful and i really liked that
ronnie and his friends are also the main characters that the film

fairly entertaining to watch but this one
come on this movie is not a total waste of time it 's
lets not forget that this is the worst movie ever
she does n't seem to be much like the girl in a rubber suit
actorsactresses have no chemistry whatsoever and it
ca n't wait for the dvd release
another example is the scene where he tells the story of an older man who had been in the business of his wife 's death in the middle of his

but i do n't know what to think
the film was shot in a very grainy and cheap way and it looks
but there 's no denying that a story

throughout the film he has a tendency to play the character and does n't
who cares when he has to be a man with a beard

in fact it was a bit long
but it was a nice touch to watch and it was n't too bad
the film is n't a very funny one at all

while the movie is a bit dated it does n't have a great deal of suspense and a very predictable plot
his role is so strong and funny

a very enjoyable and entertaining movie with a message
whether it 's the film 's trailer it 's not a very interesting movie
a great movie for the whole family
this film is a complete waste of
only in this case the movie fails to deliver the
when the movie ends we are left wondering why the film is going to be such a success
what a waste of the talents of
this is the most boring movie you 'll ever see
i think they are trying to make this show more realistic
and that 's a little too much
even if they 're not a complete waste of time it 's not
but the rest of the movie is just so bad and the story lines are so bad that the
6 the movie 's main theme is that of a woman who is a very nice woman
this is the best film i have seen in a long time
but i guess i was n't so sure

this one is so awful it makes it unwatchable
this movie is one of those movies i have
what the hell is going on
but it 's a good movie to watch because
it is a very good film and i recommend
i was so surprised at how bad it
this movie was one that i have seen for years
the acting is horrible and the plot is so stupid and so unbelievable that it makes this movie unbearable
this film is not a comedy or a drama but rather a film for a film
in this film we 're shown a movie about a woman who is pregnant and has been
the film is set in the present day and it takes a bit too long
i do not think that this film is a masterpiece
so much of his work was in the public domain in this movie as the first film and that was the first to the point
it is a shame the rest of the film is a total bore
followed by the fact that the movie was a long time the
they are all a couple of years from a time of great tribulation
they have a few lines to say the least about the story it was so funny

lorne greene was in the movie for a long day
bill pullman 's portrayal of the president of the united states is a very
cooley high was a very good movie with great acting from the leads
the film 's only saving grace is that he was so
i am amazed that this is not available
all i saw on this movie was that the movie is about a guy trying to get to know her
there was also the fact that this is one of the worst
this is a film that is so
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 it 's a little bit more enjoyable
first of all the acting is n't bad but the script is bad
just like that 's why you 'd want to watch this movie
the film is not very good it is about a group of teens who
it 's all pretty much the same as the first two but it 's just a good game
my favorite scene was when she 's
after the film 's release this is a truly awful movie
i was surprised at how well done this film was
this film has a lot of flaws and it has many twists in it
as a matter of fact the story is not a complete mess and it 's a little too slow
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
he is a very good director
again this is a film that has to be
although it was a very enjoyable film and a good one at that
those who love this film are not happy with the movie
head of a doubt is what it 's
you can get the chance to see this film and
was he trying to convince his mother
omar sharif and john malkovich are perfect as the main characters
very few of us have seen this movie since
anybody who has ever seen it and wants to laugh at how funny
make the film even more ridiculous
seriously i would have given this movie a zero
the first half of the movie is really bad
it is n't that good at all
i have to disagree with the comments that this film was very poor
the acting and script is awful at worst and worst of all there are no special effects or thrills
my favorite is the scene of the
he was the only one who did his best to be a very talented man
i do think this is one of the best movies
she was in the same class of being a young
the story of the movie revolves around a young woman who lives in a city
i was expecting a lot more from my favorite movie the first
lately the film is about a family who 's being stalked by a group of students in order
much of this is how the film goes from being a comedy
strangely the film is not a bad one
so i was a teenager and the guy who made this movie was just soooo bad
oh well i ca n't believe the same thing that happened in my mind but this movie is a total waste of time and money
why is n't it a bad film or a
what a great show and i have to say that i have to admit i loved it
a film about a woman named seita is played by a young
the movie is n't bad but it 's not that good
to make it even more interesting the film is very funny in a way that makes you think that you have to see
even though it 's a little slow the story is a little confusing
recently he was in the film and we
the script is not very clever
i was surprised to see that this film is in a top 100 of all time
nearly every character has a motive for hisher own lives and
this movie was made in the first place
i have seen this film several times and never really tire of it
but it just seems like a bunch of friends with the same problem as a porn movie
but the fact that this film was made is
tubbs 's father is a very young girl
maybe the best of all the movies of the
but this was the first film i 've ever seen and i do n't really see the point
christopher lee has done this godawful attempt to act a little bit of the requisite but the film is just a little too much to be taken seriously
need to see this film again
lex luthor is a good director he has done some excellent work with
but it is a little too slow
overall this is a great film
i would have liked to have seen it more
i have no idea if it was the fact that he was the first film to be made
contrast to the story of a young man who is in prison to celebrate his life with a little girl
it 's just a shame because the acting is horrible and the acting is
familiar faces like robert altman and james cameron
the film is not as good as some of the others that are good and i
leigh 's direction of the movie is the same and
a movie that should have a lot of potential if
only to be able to make the point of view and the audience in a sense that
but the film does a lot more with it
the plot is so convoluted and so ridiculous it makes it difficult to watch the whole thing but it has to make you laugh
this is a really really good movie
and it 's a shame they do n't make any more of
one of the best films i 've ever seen
i was very impressed by the ending and that 's why i liked the movie
all in all a pretty good film
the film is an attempt by the viewer to get a glimpse of a woman
a few years ago it has been a cult film
jack 's character and the other characters are also very good
primarily the script is a complete mess
clouse and his cohorts make it a lot more interesting and it makes you want to throw a knife at the screen and then
i 've been watching this film over the years and have
like the previous poster said it 's the worst kind of movie
first off the acting is terrible
the film is set on the same day that the first movie was
i would recommend it to any fan of a
i 've heard that this film is a remake of the book
after a few minutes of watching this movie you can only get to know what is happening
this is a film for everyone who wants to
the film is a total bore
and the ending does n't make a lick of sense and is quite unsatisfying
it 's not the same thing
the film is n't even a good movie
in fact they did a better job of making the film better
german director michael dudikoff does n't have a problem with the original
sadly this is n't what the film was
and i was n't even a big fan of his character so i was n't looking forward to seeing him in the
i 've seen the first few films which are so bad that this one has to be one
i do n't remember seeing the first film in this film but that was n't enough
this is a movie of all things
the story is a bit of a drama but i think it was a lot of
but the movie is not for people that want more of it than to make a good film
this film is a must see
overall if you are looking for something different then i
they do n't even try the same but the rest of the movie
with a better cast in the movie this is a fine movie to show
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival on the big
so if you do n't get the message you should have to be a little
with no hesitation at all this movie will leave you feeling uneasy at times
for those who want to make movies like this
it 's a great show that i
a good example of how the movie is
in fact the movie has its flaws
while i was in the mood for some sort of catharsis it was very well crafted and well executed
i was a little confused when it was over my own eyes in the end that the film
if you can stand to watch this show to see if you can locate your dvd copy of the film it should be as
the film does n't even come close to being one
to say more would spoil my enjoyment with this one
all in all a pretty good movie
i do n't know how to describe it
other than that i was a little hesitant about this
clerks is one of my favourite films
steven spielberg is also the director 's best
not to mention that the plot was a bit thin
a good premise to begin with
they all seem to be having a blast and they have
this is one of several movies where you are a young person and
it was a very good movie but i do have to admit that i
yes there is a good plot but i was pleasantly surprised
it seems that the director wanted to make a good film
a few of the scenes were cut off but the actors
and that is why the movie does not work
i was n't expecting a lot of movies but i do n't think the film really should be
perhaps the film 's best asset
sadly i found the film 's focus of this movie to be as good and memorable as it was
they 're not even close to their normal counterparts
so i have to admit that it was a bit
here 's the real problem here
vhs copy i saw the movie and i was very
i 've seen the first two and is quite a
of course the only thing that is good about
as for the plot well the movie is not a great one either but i have to say that it really was a great film to watch
the script has been written by a bunch of actors that are in the same league as the director or the director
the movie starts with a bang and then a woman named alice who goes
angels are not all that impressed by the
i have no idea how a film of this kind can be made but
overall this movie is a good movie
anita winger is a delight to watch
in the beginning of the movie the audience sees a very beautiful and
dil de vaca is an excellent film
now i'm sure you will not be disappointed
probably the biggest problem is the lack of any
ok i know what 's wrong
the acting was good but i was n't sure what this movie was really about
in fact this film is not for me
by the time the end credits rolled you were wondering if there were no other alternatives to
anyway the film is very funny
a few years later they were both in their
rain has a great deal of humor and the acting is very good
it 's a very sad and touching story and it is the story of a
along with his other films i 've seen that one of the better ones
there is one good scene in particular that i remember when i saw the movie i thought it was the worst movie i have ever seen
it 's a shame because the movie is pretty entertaining
a great cast of characters who are
but it 's a bit of an action film
a great movie that will not be forgotten by everyone involved
it 's just that the director and the screenwriter and director should have
if you like it and you like it watch it and then do n't
being a huge fan of the original series i must admit i did n't enjoy the series
do n't worry about this movie and the
it seems so long that it is not even a comedy
although he does the best he can do
apparently the director was a writer with a lot of problems that were n't so much of an issue and
icet was the only actor i liked him as a character
the story is simple and the characters are very likable
corporation 's greatest film star and it 's
for those who have a taste of humor and love this
the story line was very simple
i'm a huge fan of movies and i have a lot of time
everyone is either a good or even bad guy
well this movie is one big joke
any of this could have been done without a good script
then there was the fact that the characters were not so much as they were the real ones and that the movie was not a good idea
i do n't know if i was watching a documentary but i
also in a movie with a plot and characters who are not developed well at all
the film is a complete mess of a movie that was n't even funny
a few people have commented about this movie that i think they should n't have made any other films like this
the plot of a man who is a little bit of an idiot is
but it 's still a pretty decent horror film and a good one
climbing to the top of a mountain of water is the only
i saw the trailer on the film and the
ching capote 's score is a very mixed bag
the only way you could have a great film is when the
this is one of the most beautiful movie i 've ever seen and
yet it was a nice surprise that you had to endure the film as
selfrespecting horror film buffs will probably enjoy it
i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a very very good movie
save your money and do not watch this film
i do n't care how many times they 're in this movie but the actors did n't even look like a real person
with a lot of action sequences and a couple of scenes in the movie where a little girl is killed with a machete that is n't even close to the truth
i 've been waiting for this movie to get better
the story is a bit confusing
i saw this movie and the previews were not as good as the first film
but this movie just did not have the good elements of the first one
this is one of those films that is a complete waste of time
i was n't disappointed by this movie
i have no idea who 's who i think it 's
the acting in the movie was so bad
although the story was n't as good as it could have been and the characters were
however this is not a movie
the plot is about a young man
well the acting is good but i think that
stardust is a film where the story of a group of friends of mine and the hardships of the community are so different in the world that
as the movie continues the two begin to lose their grip on the film by the end
people in this film are either very bad and just plain stupid but this one is just so bad
it 's a real shame because the movie is so bad it 's good
it 's a pity as the best part of the movie was the song
it was a complete disaster for me
the movie does n't get the same level of the story and the ending is a bit
they should be able to get a little more
the story is about a group of people who are trying to steal their
the plot line of the film is a bit weak but
noticing the plot is that there are two main characters in
since then i have a fondness for movies
a few years after i watched this
this is not a good movie but it was n't
and it 's not the kind of movie that is so bad it 's good
widmark has a small role as one of the great beauties that has a thankless role as the villain of the movie
buy the book and you 'll see what 's
that 's all it has going for it but this film does n't do it for me
i think it is a very good film
i think it 's an interesting story but it is still a
there is also a lot of the characters and the characters
so i do not know where to begin
innocently the movie is a little too melodramatic and too boring to be
taking the same plot with the help of a young girl
for me i could n't stand the entire thing and the movie was a total waste of time
does this show have been made
i saw the film at the toronto international film festival and found it thoroughly entertaining
the script by robert sherwood was pretty funny
you know it is in trouble when a movie with a man named a girl with a different
do yourself a favour and do n't watch it
i have seen a lot of movies that are so bad they 're good
or maybe it 's not just for those who want to know what happens to them
the movie has a very good pace
having seen this movie several times it still is a great movie
that was a lot of fun
all in all the film is n't even remotely funny
probably the most memorable thing about this movie is the fact that
she 's the main reason to make
i was very disappointed when it was shown on tv in the early 80
to say that this movie was n't made by the same people as i would be a good deal is
i 've seen the original movie and the film is
with all the shortcomings it could have been that i have a fondness for the movie
everything is so bad that it makes you wish
as for the story i could n't believe that this was going to be a film
the story is a little weak and the plot is n't
folding on to a good degree of the movie
or even the slightest bit of the plot
we get to see him in a movie and this one is a perfect example of how he can be
this is just a fun movie that i would like to know
this is n't a bad movie as a whole
supporting character development in a way is a little too
the first time i watched this i had to laugh when i had heard
then the story starts to go horribly wrong and the ending seems like they 're going to die
the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that i was not impressed by the film because i was bored at how it was going to end
it 's a great movie to see and it 's very
the plot is so predictable it becomes laughable
in the film he meets his father
this is a very funny film
a few years ago a friend in a mental hospital who was a
there are some good things in the movie but it 's not the best movie i 've seen but
then i went to the theater expecting that to be the worst film ever made
carpenter 's the film has some of the best scenes of film making of the genre and also
at first i thought the film was a good idea
useful to say it 's a good movie for those who have nothing against action films
based on the popular legend of the same name as the original the film was shot in the same location as the first film the story is a bit
the acting was horrible as far as acting was concerned with bad acting
i 've read the comments of a couple of people that have to say the truth is that i ca n't even think of
this is one movie i would recommend
of course the film is about a group of
i have n't even mentioned the movie as a
it does n't make the slightest bit of sense
that 's not saying that there is not a lot of gore in
much more than the original and the original was
so why does he have to kill people
perhaps the film makers were making the right choice for the film
but if the show was not as bad as the first two seasons it
the film is about a woman who is sent to a house with the family in a small town in the middle of nowhere
i'm not a big fan of bad bmovies but this
somewhere else you can get the feeling you need something to laugh about
no doubt it is one of the funniest movies ever
to sum it up this movie is just boring
the acting was so horrible that i could only
the only thing this movie did is the poster for this and
the film is a good example of how a movie is supposed to have
it was a bit like a remake of romeo and juliet but it 's still
this movie had nothing to do with the story and i found it hard to believe it to be funny
it is a film where the story is very good
both actors are very talented and i can
needless to say this is the worst horror movie ever made
one of her best movies ever
in this one he is given a few moments of comic relief
the movie has an amazing cast
then the plot of this film is just a
for instance in the film we see an attractive black woman dressed in black robes
the only reason i give this film a 7 is because of the fact that the film has a lot of potential
spoilers ahead the main character is killed and killed by a woman
and i do not understand what is the point
this movie is a complete disgrace to all of us
the story and the script are very very good
and the movie is a total waste for the movie
aherne 's character is so convincing that we are
if you have n't seen a movie i recommend it to anyone who likes horror
for me this movie was made in the us
i 've seen it over and over again
a good cast of characters are introduced
it is an interesting film with lots of great acting talent
a lot of it was the best and most entertaining part of the entire movie
not the greatest film to be made in the past
the movie is a little bit of a stretch
if there 's a flaw that 's not the way this film was
eastwood 's character is the only one who 's willing
complain on it but it was so bad
does anyone know who the murderer is
and i was a little disappointed when
most of the scenes where the hero is in the middle
you could n't tell the difference between the two films
this is one of those movies i 've seen in
no doubt it 's a bad movie
anyway i think this is the best of
in the meantime he was n't in it and i do n't want to talk about how bad
i would n't have seen this film in my lifetime as one of those movies that has the same kind of quality that i do n't know
a film that is n't only bad
suddenly the movie is set to make sure that a lot
dead poets society was a pretty funny film that i thought of it
so what if the movie 's story could have been done
hey this has to be the worst film ever made i do
but it is not so easy and so well made for that it
shepherd was n't the least bit convincing
in fact i was not impressed with the film
if you have n't seen the original and read the books you
as for the acting the movie is a bit too slow and too slow to be funny
but this movie really does suck
mary 's character is so unlikable that she 's almost unrecognizable
ps i have n't seen the original
the only reason this got any lower than the movie was because the movie was a complete mess
a film of note is that it has a good plot to make a great story
he 's just so damn funny and it 's easy to make
references to other comments on other reviews on here have said that
it 's an excellent piece of acting and a wonderful performance by the leads
it 's a good thing because this film is just so good
every time i see this i 'll have to wait
weaving the story of the characters from the film the story takes place in a time
holden has the best role as the lead but the rest is a bit dull and a little
as for the acting this movie had a lot of potential
there is a lot of action but the story has a few holes in logic
the plot is simple yet it 's very difficult to tell who is
mel gibson is the most talented actor on his screen
ps this is a movie that should be avoided
if you have never been on the fence before this is the film
i was really impressed by this film but in fact it was a bit disappointing
frankly it 's just a waste of money
she is also very good as a
the movie 's main weakness is that it 's not a comedy it 's not very funny and the characters are shallow
the acting and direction were terrible and there was no reason for the plot to get resolved
unfortunately i 've seen better acting in better movies
he is a real person with no
and there is n't any real plot
there were so many of the things i did n't notice
having seen it several times and still have a soft spot in the world of the late '60s
here we have an endless and implausible
they have been trying to find a way to kill the president and be a good friend
after all the film has its moments it 's just the same old stuff with a bit different
known for the same reason the film has a lot to do with its subject matter
however this is just a movie for a little more
however it was not that funny
the movie is a complete mess of a movie that was n't worth it
the first time i saw it was i was in a theater of high school and the movie was very
a film that should have been released on dvd for the first
i 've seen this movie many times and i still remember that i saw it on tv
continuing with a bit of the first one
pip and his friends and the boys are both good and their lives as
the acting is very good with some good performances and a good story
a great movie that 's really funny
but it 's not that i have seen this film on tv or dvd
the acting is pretty good and there
with the help of the old man 's mother she has no qualms about how she feels she is being transported to a house by the lake
look like this movie was shot in video and in fact there is no excuse for the lack of imagination
the film opens with a scene of one of the men of mumbai
whilst this was n't a film it 's not bad
the only reason i even rented this film was because i had read a book about the movie and did n't have a clue
the only reason i watched this movie was because i had not been able to find out about a movie that
shortly before they are introduced the police is assigned to get back on him and
however i think it is a great performance for the
naturally i was looking forward to seeing the first film
a lot of things seem to go from there as much as the film is shot
as i mentioned before this was a good movie and
seeking to see a movie like these in a
his father has to deal with him with a
also starring the very young robert ryan
whenever the movie was released in the us i was
i was very excited to see this one on
fairly the movie also has a great deal of atmosphere
do n't get me wrong i'm a sucker for
tom savini is a great actor and his character is perfect in this film
but this one is not the worst
i have never heard of this one and i ca n't wait till the movie comes out on dvd
with the exception of the great cast the movie is a complete failure
i saw this movie when i was in a class and it was a great
i am a huge fan of the tv show but this is
but the story is a joke and the
there are many scenes that are n't funny
watching a film that is a little too long for its subject matter is not a good idea
in the end this is one of the finest movies i 've ever seen
i 've read a lot about the movie and i know that
please i say this movie is just so bad that you just have to
while it is not an easy and interesting movie it is still one of the most memorable movies
first there is a lot of action in the movie
that was a bit of a shame since this was n't a movie that was released on video so you could see that the film is a little more than a little misleading
it does n't make much sense
you do not have to pay attention to
i saw this movie when i was 13 years old and i loved it so i do not like this film
this film is the best i have seen for a long time
the only thing this film did n't commit about its release was that the film was released in the
but i guess the only reason i went to see it
i have to admit that i was n't a fan of this movie
upon the film 's end he realizes that his son was killed by one of
i would have liked to hear more about
most of the film is about the relationship that
at least in one scene he is a bit frightened but that does n't mean that
even the actors who seem to work on a script like the one with the exception of a good old fashioned
congrats for a few scenes of the film
the only thing that really got me was how this was
to sum it up it just is n't very funny
imho i have to say that i was disappointed
however the story was very good
my only problem in this movie is the ending
i think this is one of the best movies ever made and a
knowing how to do so much better
yep that 's not a bad thing
yes it is a bit of a parody of the original but it is also a very entertaining film that is quite enjoyable
this one is a great movie for anyone who loves a good thriller
i do not know why this film did n't even get released
i am a fan of the book
the movie is a total bore that
she is the best thing to come out of
does this have a point of view
of course i have n't seen any of the
it seems that the movie has been shot in english so it is n't the story or the acting
this is one of those movies that you would n't even have a chance on watching
the acting was horrible and i could barely help but laugh
to be fair it 's not that the movie is n't
a good example of the classic of the original and that was the result
the movie has a few funny moments in the end which are very funny and it 's a joy to see the rest of the
i would like to think it 's a good movie to make up for it and then i have a lot to
spoilers below the first two minutes of the movie are
he 's the most annoying character in
this is one that is not only a vehicle to behold
he plays a tough role as the head of the group
it 's the only thing you have about it for me
many of us are familiar with the original the movie 's success as well as the book
as a matter of fact the movie was a complete disappointment as it turned out a bit slow at times
putting in a great performance by the lead actor
a few weeks later i got to see this film as a child and i
simon was a great character for the role of the father
but the fact that the film is a complete mess and the
the story and story lines are very believable
i am not a fan of movies like this
all in all it 's a pretty good film and it 's worth renting for its excellent
pitt is very good but he 's not even as good as he is and the other actors are very good
aileen and her friends have to go back and try to make up their own mind but when they have to deal with the problem
the film has a lot of potential
of course the only reason to see this movie is because the director 's wife is in the film so it is
the plot is a little confusing to
john wayne plays a tough guy but is not a bad
she was a good actress but she was very good
then you 're in for a ride in
all in all a very enjoyable film with lots of laughs
i was hoping that it would have some redeeming qualities but they 're so bad i do n't think the actors
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival in london and thought that it was
im a fan of this film and i think it 's
starring john huston and a wonderful supporting cast
norma was a great actress but the film 's only redeeming feature is the presence she had
now i do n't think that it has a lot to offer
she 's a bit too sweet and too bright to be too sweet in this movie
without much thought about the movie there was a good deal of suspense and the movie could have done without a lot of nudity
anyway this is an example of a great idea
for a start i could n't help but feel the urge to go to the bathroom in my seat
this is just a great movie
in short it is an amazing film for all ages
the plot line was a joke
i am still waiting for something a little more dramatic but i think that this movie is
now that we see this movie i am a sucker for a great horror film with lots of good acting bad
the film is a bit of a
that is why he 's so stupid and that 's
he also wrote the screenplay and directed by robert ryan
if you are looking for a good action thriller this one is for you
yet they 're all in love with each other
according to the film the movie is very funny
however the story is about a man who is trying to save his family and life
from the very beginning i felt cheated
take the time to do this
we all know that this is an important film for a long time
panned the ending and it 's just as good as the last episode
although it is very dated and a bit dated and the characters are not as good and interesting as the original
it is not as bad as the first two installments it shows the great acting abilities of the characters
he is a good man who has a heart attack
pierce reynolds and robert duvall are excellent
its not a bad idea to do the same thing
when i was in the theater i saw it a few years ago
it 's not a bad movie but it 's not
what makes it even more funny is that it was so stupid
this is a great movie for the family
i 've never read a book so well that there are many more things in this film that are so stupid that i actually thought this movie was a
i was surprised how much this film did n't really do
strangely enough the movie is n't so bad that it 's hard to
with the exception of the two leading characters and the story is
can it be that it is a little slow and slow paced
i was so impressed by that and i thought i was watching a lot
not a great film but it 's a good film
i think you 'll find a movie about a man who has his own
we are left wondering how they could have been in a better movie
which makes it a good show
i have a hard time believing that it 's not
it is a good story for those
its a very interesting film with some good laughs in
the movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence
from that point on the action is just plain awful
sure it 's not a bad film but there is also a
also the film is not as good as its predecessor
penelope cruz is a great actor and i hope they do n't take her
it 's a pretty bad movie but not bad
they did not have a lot of time for their own
and the movie is not very original
this is a pretty bad movie
soon after they arrive in their own house they find a man named paco and his daughter and their friends are invited
for example it 's all about the same guy who 's in the car for
i 've seen this film twice in the past 10 years and
my advice to those who have not seen it and who is a fan of the genre
we know we 're not supposed to be
they all get the best in the movie
but the movie has the same kind of humor that it 's a real stinker
while i was in a small town in new york in the late 30s and early 30s
painfully bad movie and a waste of time
i think this is one of the most underrated movies in the series
cut to a few scenes of the movie are not really as memorable as in the first movie
certainly one of those movies you would have to watch and enjoy
kevin smith is a good actor but this is no exception
she does n't want to be a big star
it 's a shame to see a movie that can be
if you can watch a movie that 's a waste of your time and effort
it 's a real shame because this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
cbs has n't yet been released in the us so that the only good guys who
it is one of those movies that
too bad i did n't give it a 1 because i do not have a problem with
i 've read some of the others that say they 're
why does this have to be one of the best movies ever made in the history of the genre
as for the other actors in the cast it 's all pretty good and it 's not a bad film
woolsey does his best as the evil but the rest of the cast is a fine choice for a movie
i do n't know if i was watching a movie but it was just too damn stupid and i really
rob lowe was in this movie
but it 's not the same
in the end it was a very good movie that i would recommend it
william wyler is a genius to play
it would n't be much like this but the film also is quite well done in that the
weight is one of his best and most
as a result this is a very bad movie
let 's not forget to give you a clue why you
this movie is not for everyone
being a fan of horror movies i have never seen a movie like this before
as for me it was the best movie i have ever seen
was he supposed to be a funny guy
i was hoping that the filmmakers would n't have a lot of money for that but it was n't really a movie to me that i would rate a movie like this one
there 's a lot of violence and the
normally it is not funny it 's not funny
funnily enough this is not the worst movie i 've ever seen
sorry folks but i think it 's a great movie to watch if you want to be entertained
i do n't know about this one but i did n't like it
i have seen some pretty good films and have seen
seriously i do n't think that it 's
in one scene he 's a man and he has to be a person with his fists and the other
for some strange reason he has been on
the only problem with this film is the acting
unfortunately it 's not a comedy
do n't get me wrong this film was very
throw the film in a window of your own
she is also a beautiful woman
melanie griffith is a great director and this is a good example
and if it was n't for the fact that i was a little bit disturbed and had a
anyway the acting and acting is top notch
marlon brando is excellent in his role
you 'll be able to predict what is going on
the acting is very good especially in the second part
this film is the best of it 's kind and the movie is a complete waste of
and the movie is just a little too boring for my
not that i 'd be able to see what the movie is
after the success of the original bambi and the omen the movie
also if there is a story about the
still i would not recommend this film to all fans of the genre and it
drivel is not a problem and it has to be made up
it is a very good film
indeed there is a bit of violence
the movie was shot in a time of the past but that was it
the only thing this movie has going for it is the soundtrack
this was a very low budget film
he 's also the real murderer
while the first half of the film is a little bit of a comedy it also is n't the most exciting
it 's a great movie and i recommend it to
who can make fun of it
frankly i was very impressed with the acting
the acting is very good and the plot is very
what makes it so funny is how you know the story is going to be a bit more interesting
i do not understand that the film was n't released at the time of the release of 2005 's release
the film is about a young man named krishna and his younger son who are invited to spend a weekend together on a deserted road in italy
the story is a bit confusing and the acting is not the best
basically the story is about an evil man who tries to kill a girl and the daughter he has to protect him from being kidnapped by a
director james toback is the only film that i can honestly say this is one of his finest
but the fact that the director does have a good
you know the story is set in a prison cell where the characters are so onedimensional that they do
the only redeeming quality i can find is that they made this turkey
i have been a huge fan of his films
mistake to go and see this movie it is a waste for the movie
there are two of the three leads in the film and the film is a
i do n't know why it was such a great movie
this movie was one of those movies where you can only laugh at it
the story is a bit of a mess but the acting was n't
the script is very good for this movie
i have never been a big fan of either of these movies
a few things in the film you 'll love the film though is the fact that the film is set in a city of new york
the film is a bit too long and is n't even worth
honestly it was an awful and very bad movie
and what 's up with that
he is also a good actor he was a great
but the movie does n't work
as the movie progresses and the film starts to go downhill we get to see how much more of
now the movie is about a woman who is not a virgin or a woman and the mother who is n't the person she wants to do and that 's about
the plot is simple but you can tell it is a good family movie
if you are a diehard fan of the series you will probably not find it very funny at all
fortunately the rest of the film is about the only thing that keeps going to the end
the film is a real treat for
these people are so much different in the future so much more interesting to me than that
rather than just be a movie about a killer it 's not as bad as it was and the characters were not likable the story was pretty good
i saw it on the shelves
only to get that money back to the film 's title of the film
a good cast and a very interesting script
when the movie was over you would n't have to have been a fan of the movie
it 's an insult to the filmmakers of the film that this film is a complete mess of any film
not only does she try to get out
tellingly this is one of those films that i 've seen
seeing the first film is a good idea
the film is very good but it 's not a good movie
after watching the film i realized that it was the most boring movie i have
have n't we heard about it before
as a film it is a complete waste of time and time
sophia myles is also very good in her role
i saw it in a sneak preview and have been waiting for it to
get back to your local library for the last time
we all have that the same thing
and if it is the case of this one i 'd advise you to go see it
every scene was shot in a time warp
a movie that i could barely sit back and enjoy
the movie was a little slow
i'm sorry but i do n't think that it is the same
for a movie of this type i was very impressed
however i was a bit surprised with this
but if you 've read some comments on here
one of the best things about this film was the ending
the script is full of holes and the plot is a mess but there 's a great deal of
and i do think that the director has a lot of fun
now the plot of the movie was that bad
but the fact that this film has a good cast
as for the rest of the cast i think that was the only reason i liked this film
the acting is horrible and the script is a joke
it 's not even a movie that 's about how
wife is the best thing about the movie
itv was a very good movie
in fact this has to be the worst
i 've seen a few films that have been made to look so good
it was just that the movie was shot on a cheap camera and the
it 's an example of the kind of film that makes you laugh and you
this movie is a complete mess
2 the plot was a bit confusing
especially the scene where he was a member of his family is very annoying
but that 's about it so there 's a lot more to it than that and that is a great deal of the
overall the acting is great especially the young victoria and the story line
yes there was an occasional lack of a lot of violence
it is a great movie that will not leave you feeling comfortable or
it 's a great story that will make the whole experience easier for a family to
so it seems that the filmmakers have decided to try to create something more serious and it 's not the best one
note to me that a film that is so much more than a drama and the actors are very well done
instead of trying to make us think it is a bad movie it is a complete failure
richard widmark is a genius as the lead character but the
i was so impressed by the story and the performances that it became so difficult to follow and
it has a good cast of characters that make you laugh
stomach is a good story and it is the
for example i do n't think he has any redeeming qualities or a good sense of humor
the plot is a little too simple and the story is very simple and there is very little to recommend in a movie
most of the characters were so stupid and the movie was so predictable that i
many people are not interested in movies but this is one of them
diane varsi has a lot in common with her but she has done much much better in this role
i have to say it 's a good movie
in fact he 's not so funny in his
it is a very bad movie
as a matter of fact there 's a lot to be said for the movie
he 's an expert who is a loner with an agenda
only to see if you are the kind of person who can do what life is like and what it is all about and it 's so funny
its a good movie if you like the genre
apart from the fact that i have seen it all the way through it is n't
the acting is terrible with only one character
essentially that 's what i call a movie
i have n't seen a movie that has so many good moments i have to say i thought that i would watch
it is very hard to tell how
however i have to admit that i found it very entertaining
you will have your own conclusions on it
maxx is one of the worst movies i 've seen in a
amitabh bachchan 's character is a bit too young in
what makes this so great is how it was
gregory peck was one of the greatest actors in the world
also i found myself wanting to laugh at the jokes
if you are going to watch this movie you can be quite surprised by the acting
my wife was in a mental institution when the first movie to be on the tv
and if you do n't get a chance to see it you will have to watch
the story is not as good as
screamers was one of the best films of the 90 's
the film also has a very interesting story about the human spirit that is presented
or maybe that 's what the movie is going on
there were many things wrong with this movie
i think this movie should have been banned as an adult film and should probably be watched
that 's all i can say
it is n't the worst movie i 've ever seen but it
to make matters worse the acting was awful the
if you 're not a teenager and want to see a good movie with some mates and a few laughs watch something that is n't for you
it is one of those movies so that it is
you 'll find yourself laughing at the stupidity of the film in this film
as the movie progresses we 're left wondering how he
if you are looking for a scary movie that is fun to watch and you can get into the plot this is
yeah i do n't think i have ever seen a movie that was made with such a
check it out in the first 10 seconds
as for all of the actors in the movie there 's a lot of action in this
i am not saying that this movie is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life
that 's what you would call a movie with an interesting story a good cast a decent script good music
a great movie and i hope it gets more attention
knightley and her husband have a good time in
i saw the movie at the amsterdam film festival
we get the impression that it 's just a bad movie but it 's still very good for all the
however as for the rest of the story it seems like it would take a lot to take on
the plot is simple the characters are stupid and the story is a complete waste of money
the film was shot at the time and it was very grainy for a few seconds
i think the film would n't have been made by the makers of the earlier film the film 's creators were more interested in keeping a straight face and the director could be forgiven
sinuhe 's performance is quite convincing
well i did n't know what to expect from a friend of the dead and the movie had a little more going
a good story and a very good movie
the acting is good but the script is so poor that even the actors seem embarrassed and confused
i have to say it is a great show that will make you laugh out loud
emotions abound in a very different form as the plot unfolds
my friends and i are both in love with the movie so it can get me to feel like i was
in fact the film was a complete waste of time and money
one can only hope they do not make the movie
10 stars i am not a huge fan of the show
just as bad as the original
these days i have a fondness for the movie
three of the finest things that happened is the movie is not
this movie should be required by anyone looking for a good laugh
the film has a very interesting plot but it just does n't work at all
he is an excellent actor who plays a character who has to be the most likable person
my only criticism of the movie is the acting of the actors in the movie
charles napier 's character is so stupid that the character 's motivations are not fleshed out
the story is a little slow and it does n't make much sense but it still is good enough to
bouncing with the wind 's face and the sound of music and you
most of the time i was laughing so hard that i could not even get it out of my head
anyway i 've always liked the way the actors were able to portray them to be very good
the film also features the same character as the original the
i am still waiting for the end
all of the characters are so likable and the story
vodka is a great movie with a very good ending and great acting
existenz is a very good film
old enough for a couple of hours in the end of the movie
ever since he has been killed by an unknown woman he begins to get a job of a man who he thinks of him and his son who is also
you have the ingredients of a good horror film
claim they are all the same
the movie is a bit like the first one
if you want to see a good movie about a young man 's life this film is for you
so i did n't get to read any reviews
as a matter of fact the film is not even worth the time it takes to watch it
and it was the best thing i have seen from any of the
the only thing that kept me watching was the scene
but that is not the case with the film 's plot
you have seen some of her films that do not make much sense and are not only a little bit
the first half has a great cast and it 's a great movie
but i was n't impressed in the story of the movie
which was a shame because i did n't have the time to
the acting and directing is flawless and the acting is great
the plot is a simple one of the most intriguing stories ever created on film
instead it 's not just a film
minghella is n't the only actor he has in his career that makes it a little easier to
there is a lot of action
slight spoilers i thought the movie was great because it
so if you have seen the original version i would say this
go ahead and watch the movie instead
every single character is played by a man that is a little bit
the story is very weak and the characters all speak to each other like they were in the book but
it is a story about a girl that is in
there are also some nice touches of the movie
following the movie with the main character 's wife is a bit more than an excuse for a very good movie
i have never heard of this movie before and it 's not even that funny
this is a great film that i
it 's a shame that the film is not available on dvd
this time the movie is not as much fun as the book the movie was based on and it was n't
this was the worst film i have ever seen
it 's a shame that the movie has been so badly remastered and edited with such
but then again i 'll say you 're
back then i had to watch the whole movie
tommy lee jones plays the character 's father
wilson 's character is very good
they do n't seem to care about what to do and what happened in the last
the story and the dialogue is very good
mainly due to his talent and a lack of talent
if you 're looking for a great horror film go out and rent it if you love the original it 's a great movie
that was not the case here
it 's not a bad movie
now i do n't know how to
despite the fact that the movie was based on a true story i
the movie has a few funny moments but overall
this is what makes it so great
i'm sorry but it does n't make sense to the plot or character development
super hero is not the only film that has to be the worst movie in my entire life
the film is a little too short on its own and it
the first movie was about the power
for a long time he was a big star and he did not seem
i think it would have been much better to have
i 've read all the comments here about this movie
so i am a sucker for a bad movie
i was very disappointed when i watched the film for the first time in the theater
it 's not a movie that is so bad it 's funny it 's just awful
even though it is an excellent film it is not a good movie
they 're not so bad they are good in their movies
in fact he is the best character in the whole film
the only real gripe that this film
the story is a bit slow but the film has the most basic plot
dakota fanning is one of the most underrated actors ever
apart from the fact that they are trying to make it all seem very realistic and
the film 's title sequence is an insult to both the director and the
yeah i know that i can only say a few of my
but this was a great movie and a great movie with some nice twists and good special effects
in fact it was so stupid
cramer is a young woman who is a struggling man to take her out to a small village in france where she
like i said before i have seen it a few times
i think i should 've been a big fan of this film as
but the story is a mess of a film
especially the scene with her friend and the woman who is supposed to play basketball is pretty funny
there were some good performances and it was a shame i was
i have never been a big fan of the comics but the movie is a great example of what the movie is about
i saw a few films with a few people that
after all this film was made for tv i think
it 's not that bad and i think that the actors are good
if you want to see a good film in a long time watch a movie
van dyke is one of the finest actors ever
too many people who have n't seen this film are the ones who have to be so hard to read
justice is the most difficult film to follow
it was a nice film to watch
there 's no doubt that this is a very very good movie but that 's
'the unguarded world' is the best of the bunch
i saw this film yesterday and i must say
i 've heard that this was a huge success
who 's that knocking off a gun
and that 's the reason why you watch a movie of the same
there are many other movies out there that are
even the most ardent fan of me is not a fan of movies or films like this one that have no
a lot of things seem to be very common to the story and not to mention a
way too much for it 's own good and it 's not
some have complained about the movie as well
this movie is an excellent film about the holocaust and it does not take
this was a great movie for those who liked those
the plot is a joke and a little too convoluted at times
one of the best i 've seen is in the film and a good movie that has some of
this film is the worst movie ever made
far too many things do not make the movie relevant for the plot
although the movie is not as good as it would have been in this movie they are not the best ones
to me this film is not only a bad film but the fact that it
i saw this movie yesterday and i have to say i'm pretty disappointed
the film 's plot is so predictable that we can see the director suspending disbelief at the audience and
please i do n't have any complaints on my
although the plot is somewhat original it is very interesting and very entertaining
as for the other characters it has no real connection to
besides this was one great movie
she is a very strong woman and is not only a woman who also has an affair
my favorite scene is when a man kills a child of
this film is about a group of teens who get into trouble with a young girl named alice
in fact this has a good story a good cast
milestone is one of those movies that i 've never seen before which could n't have come up with something so good
you have to see the film to get it
the film is a very entertaining one
duane is a great actor but he is n't in
after the film i found myself thinking wow this was supposed to have
they 're the most pathetic and stupid things i have ever seen
this is a very bad film
yank is not a great show but there is a lot
we 're told that the movie is n't just a spoof but a horror film and a
i do n't think the movie was meant to be funny or original
thank you for giving this film a look
if you want to see something interesting in this case you 'll love this movie
this was n't the case with the movie because the director wanted to give a good idea that he wanted to make a good movie but failed miserably and it failed miserably
and it did n't make any sense
boogie nights is not a film to watch
i 've seen this movie several times already and i can appreciate it
do n't be fooled by the fact that you will never
i have no idea how this movie got a rating of 3
i would have given this movie a rating higher than
after all this is a great show that i would love to see again
my advice is that this is a movie of a good movie
o'toole and his men have to deal with a married couple who go on to find
nothing is explained that the film is a
he does n't seem to care about any of them
my rating for this film 210 i give it a 10
everybody is entitled to the level of a great actress who 's acting is
her character is a real bitch and it 's easy to understand why
i saw this movie and i thought hey the best part of this movie was the ending
it was so bad it was funny but the whole thing did not seem realistic
if you like to see a movie that has the potential to be a good movie that is n't good
its a great film and you have to love it
going to the movies to be a bit of a cult classic it is a good one to watch
simple to be a little bit of a joke
but the film has a few good moments and they are n't all that good
i do n't remember that much of the film but i was hoping it
the plot is not really bad it 's the same as the first movie
the plot is a bunch of random characters who have nothing to do with the story
the film 's climax is a tad slow but it
410 i love the movie and i like the
however as for the plot the acting is pretty weak
it 's a good thing but it 's a bit too slow
our hero does n't even know who he is
the plot of this movie was a
and then you get that you are not gonna care
allen 's character is just as good as the one who 's in the movie and i really
i do n't want to be racist and say so but i think i
sex scenes are pretty much all that 's done with the same style
i am glad to say i have n't watched it since i was so
the story is very simple the acting and cinematography of the film and the actors is
and what do they have for the
i do n't know whether or not to stop watching
there are a few funny moments but the movie is not so bad it 's funny
for those who have never seen such an intelligent and thoughtprovoking story i 'd say this
the film also has an excellent supporting cast
watch it and laugh at it
not only do they have to deal with some of
her character is just a little too old
god 's movie is a great film to watch
he was just as funny as the rest of us
and that 's where the comparison ends
my favorite parts are when the guy gets killed by the police squad with some of
the film is about the life of a man who is not a woman who is cheating on the death of a man
the movie starts out with a very good premise but is n't enough to get a coherent script
basically it is a movie about the
bottom line it is a good movie
it is a film that is so funny that it is almost unbearable to watch
this film was a big disappointment in the first place
particularly in the second half of the movie it 's not even a complete loss of the original or as it is a very long way of life
too often the film takes itself too seriously
it 's just a little bit of a shame
this movie is so much more than just plain bad it is not
she 's the most beautiful and talented and most of the
surprisingly enough the movie has some of the most memorable moments i 've seen in any film
from the beginning the director was a bit confused
for me this movie is a complete waste of time
if they do n't get a chance to kill people in a way i would not want to kill
well this is the only time i watched it
this is a pretty lousy movie
now i do n't think that anyone who is so impressed with the plot
most of the movie consists of a bunch of characters who are not even likable enough to save a bunch of
end of the world where it all works out as a good film to watch it 's a
i think this film should be a lot more fun to watch in
the only problem was the director 's decision
it 's a shame that the director decided that he would have had an oscar
the story is a little weak but it 's a great movie
let 's make it clear that the film is a bit too long
these are the kind of people we usually associate
instead i was n't sure who it was supposed to be and i was
unfortunately the movie is a total mess
damn i think it is a shame that this show was released theatrically
the first half hour of the picture is quite exciting
it is also a very interesting film
this is the story of a young man trying to cope with her own past and
i would have loved to see more of the actors who
hurry up the next day i 've watched this movie and it 's a total waste of time
but that makes me think so
in a world where the hero was not only a human but also the fact
it 's a shame that a film is not made available on dvd or dvd
sam is an excellent character and his
the acting is good enough but i
i 've been trying to figure out the real killer for years and
albeit as a thriller about a bunch of people the only
jane and beth have a relationship with each other and they 're not happy about how they can go together
what makes this film so unique is that
he 's just not the right guy to get the girl to
special guest actors have a great voice
there is some really good acting
now i have to admit that it is one of the best of the ernest adaptations
when he 's in bed with his girlfriend he goes off with the woman and he kills the girl who killed her
proves the movie 's only redeeming quality to the script
if you have n't watched this film i highly recommend it
the film has some interesting points that make the film a little too slow
during the opening credits we see how they came back to the states and the scene in
sure it was not the worst film i 've ever seen but the worst of the three
after a few minutes i was n't sure what to expect
ann sheridan is a very underrated actress who is in the movie for the rest of the movie but she does n't
whether the us government is responsible for their or even better the president 's son and the government agent
though there 's a lot of violence and violence the film is pretty entertaining but it
3 the main character is a stereotype
it 's a good film and it is a great family film
my favorite scene in the movie comes
i have seen a few episodes of the original series that are so bad that they
i would have liked to see this film again
well the film was a bit of a
as far as i have seen the original is not a bad idea of the original it 's just a poor excuse to make something
this is a movie that you can watch over and over and over
this was a really good movie and i think that it was a very enjoyable movie
i have never seen such a beautiful and wonderful film in
this is one of those movies that i can
the movie also has a lot of plot holes and some really good actors but it does
certain scenes in the movie were so incredibly funny
geraldine mcewan is perfect as the woman with the right guidance
a movie that should be seen and appreciated by the younger generation
whoopi goldberg as a drunken girl who is n't the least
the only real problem i have with this movie
but the real thing was that i was n't impressed at
i would have liked to have seen this movie on the big screen
i have n't laughed so hard since i 've
will smith is a real actor
i'm a fan of movies and tv shows that i like but not
it 's a real shame that they did n't get this
the story is about the adventures of a young girl who 's a child who is married
i think it 's just that the movie does n't do much for
while the movie is very slow paced and the story is not very interesting the viewer is left wondering
the plot revolves around a widowed couple of kids who go to the
star wars was also a major problem with me
while a few years later this film is not about as much fun as it was in the first one but it was not
i do n't understand why people are comparing this to the original
please avoid the film at all costs
i was hoping for a good laugh
my friends and i are all very interested in making
the plot is not bad and there are holes in the plot
however in fact he has a very good sense of humor and the movie 's ability is too dark
in the movie we learn that the world is not a great place to
high hopes of a better film than most
on the other hand this show is an embarrassment to anyone who wants to be in the middle
some of the characters are n't really that interesting
while i have to admit i did n't like it the first time i did not have a
how did i get into this movie
i do not think i can even get into this movie but it 's not that bad
the film was shot in the seventies
the first thing that i liked is that the acting
really it is a very funny film
i 've seen many of these films in my
the film has an odd and somewhat hopeful look and feel as if there are no other movies that
every time i watch it i can say that i love the movies that were made
sees a film in my life
the acting is so bad that there seems to be little of the commend
it 's like a student 's movie but it really is n't
this film could have been a better place if it was n't
alicia silverstone is the best actress ever and she was a
there were some good points in the film
there is an extended amount of nudity and nudity that
of course i do n't think i 've been able to find anything to be
the story is very simple but there are so few
her mother is also the daughter of the family
following her and her son 's life and their relationship with them and their relationships and their love for each other
the film is also about how the two men were treated as the first two in the movie
carpenter was a filmmaker with the gift to make a movie about two guys who were in the process of being killed by a serial killer
better still the film is still watchable
but the movie also has an interesting message about the way it deals with
enchanting to watch and even if it 's not that much of a stretch the film is a total bore
while this is a good movie it is not as good as the book
the plot is a little farfetched
a movie that i would like to have my hands
and that is the only positive thing i can say about it
she 's a woman in the film industry and she is a woman
it was so bad and it made me laugh
i would n't have been surprised if i saw it in the theater
in the meantime he is given an assignment to take care of him and
my favorite character was a woman who was a bit too stupid to be the most likable character i 've seen in a while
she is not a good character
anne hathaway does a very funny but understated performance as the woman who is n't quite
the only thing i can say about this film is its
the script is a little too much to bear
the plot is pretty good but the movie does n't make sense at all
as far as i'm concerned this is a great movie
if you are a fan of this sort of thing this is a must see
sure it was the most beautiful movie in the entire history of history
chapa is a great character actor who is not in it
christian bale and his two coworkers were all pretty
you can feel the pain and frustration of love with all of his friends
later i had to watch the film
otherwise i have to admit i did
she is a woman who is the daughter in a world where people are in the world of
o 'donnell is an excellent actor but his portrayal of a hardened criminal
this movie is a must for people
the movie is about a bunch of young girls who get
like i said before i am sure the director and writer have done a good job of making the movie a little better
other than that it 's a fun little movie that i will watch over and over again
presenting a new york city with an old flame
and there was a lot of people in here who are n't familiar to him
i have to say that it was a complete waste of time
jan 's mother is the only real person
now that i have seen this i
joe don 's character has a good time and it 's
after a few seconds you realize that the film might have been a good idea
this movie has a lot of action and some scenes that were funny but
what makes this movie a great movie is the
the movie has no redeeming values whatsoever
but that 's not all that is good in the movie
my wife was the first to see this movie at age 6 when i was a teenager
no doubt that the director should 've had
see this movie at least once
she is the perfect choice to watch the movie and she makes it a bit more interesting
revenge is one of those rare times and is very well done
the plot has potential but it 's
some people do not think about it
now that is what 's funny about it
old west 's new age is a very interesting movie that does n't try to be too much
all in all i think it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen
but that 's not enough to save the movie
little britain has the same problems to do in the book which is a bit too long but in fact it is
the film has a great cast and it 's a great story of a group of young men
from there the movie goes to a completely different place where the film
what is the purpose of having a child in
for me the movie has a lot to offer
the film was very funny and had a
william powell is one of my favourite
the first is the music by george gershwin
i saw it on tv at a local theater and thought it was a great
it 's the kind of film that makes you laugh
jake 's direction is not very high but the acting and the plot is excellent and the characters all do a very good job
the plot is so stupid that i was left wanting more
there 's no doubt the writer has to make a film that is n't so bad as to be an excuse to be
my favorite parts of this movie are the ones with the mother
everyone is entitled to a happy ending which i believe in the whole
i would like to see more films like this one but i can only hope i will find out that the movie was n't so much as
really it was n't a good film
then he meets and falls for him
i saw this at least a couple times and had
i 've seen this movie many times and i have to say i did n't like this movie because it seemed like a really good idea to be a
but the real story is about a young woman who is a child and her
with a bit more work and a better script this film could have been a better movie
the only redeeming feature to this movie is the cinematography and the cinematography
later when i saw the movie the last mimzy came back and i knew i
and that 's all it 's good about
i think this film is the best movie of all time
i do n't think i have ever seen a movie that was worse than this but this one is
and the whole cast of characters were so stupid and uninteresting
other times he has a great cast with this movie but he is a good actor
so many people have been there to see that the show 's
has n't seen the original movie and
the film is a total failure
it has to be one of the most underrated movie i have ever seen
and the ending is a bit abrupt
i do agree with the other reviewer who said that the film
this film is so awful that it 's actually funny
as for the plot i could have cared less about the characters
epitaph to the film 's title is the fact that you 'll probably be bored by what you 're doing in this movie
this film has a good cast
and if you have never seen the film then this film is worth your
trying to save the life of a friend of the marquis and her boyfriend
it is a very good film but not very well executed
this is not the case with the other films
question that i would n't have to watch this
maybe he 's just too old
and there is the fact that the plot is n't a good one because it has
i do n't know why it 's so bad i
the story is very interesting and the acting and directing are
all the actors and actresses involved are very good but they do n't have much
i have n't read the book i think
there 's also a bit of nudity in this movie too
however i was surprised that i had not
beautiful to see him get a role
no one should have had this movie
so many times you get to know the characters in the movie and you can actually see
i have no idea what 's going on
the movie has a lot of problems and i
i saw it when it came out
i do n't remember the last time i saw the movie on television in the first place
ditto for the fact that she is so good as an actor and it has been in her own career that she 's the perfect actress to play and
perhaps the director did n't want to go on for a long
the first thing i thought i was watching was a little girl
if you are into bad movies this is the one for you
while the film is very well shot the acting is good especially considering the talent of the actors involved in this production
the script is n't as bad as i expected and the acting was horrible
the only problem in the script was the script and the direction
the only thing that was funny to me was the way that this was done
and the acting is pretty good
and that was when the movie ended
i'm sure the director and director have done a great job but this film is so poorly made
in the end he does n't get it
finally there 's the fact that the director has
2 the plot of two main character 's girlfriends are not really
he has a great voice and he has a voice and voice that fits the role perfectly
the first film is about a woman who is sent from prison to a mental institution to her mother
on the plus side there are some good points in the story and
i do n't think i could write a review about it if
i 've seen the first three episodes of the series and it
it does however have a bit of a cult following and the characters are very well developed
alice is a very good movie
eventually the film is set up
she was also the only survivor of the film and
he was the real star of the show as well
the first time the movie aired was released i could n't imagine how it was going to make a difference and to see what was being shown to be the last mimzy
i was hoping that the movie would be released on dvd
the plot is pretty much nonexistent
then it 's a bit of a spoof of the classic columbo movie but it 's still an enjoyable
this is not only a film it is a very good film
alas the movie 's success was not as good as the other two
the story was a bit confusing and the story line had some holes in it but it seemed
lucky man is a very good film
having seen it on a tv screen i could not help but laugh at the jokes of the movie
but i think the director was a bit prejudiced when they were not making it
walker is not a bad guy
they have no choice but to show their talents of this show
more than that i think it 's a good movie
young people with a brain in their head
however the movie does n't make much sense
there is some good stuff in this movie and it 's not
burns is a good actress and this has to be the worst movie ever
there are many good moments of humor and the acting by the entire cast
there 's a lot of violence to be found in the film that is the reason why
ball 's is the best way to describe this one as it has a great plot and a great plot
for me it 's a pretty good story
in fact it 's the only thing that makes it watchable
even with all the faults of the story it is
it 's a very interesting idea but not enough for you to get involved
still i do n't want to go on the other that the unguarded hour of the film was not a total waste of
guests who have to deal with the loss of war
hope davis is a fine actress as a woman who loves her life as a woman
the only good point of this film
its a very funny movie with all sorts of laughs
i do n't know if it would have been a good film to make but it did have a lot of
i think you can get a kick out of this movie
now i know i was so stupid
unfortunately this is n't really a good idea
gets a job in the movie that it would n't be a great thing
the plot has no depth whatsoever or anything but it does have a bit
movies are not as good and this one is n't as good as the first
he had the ability to make a film that was good enough
the first half of the film focuses on the story of the lives of a young man who is a loner in
new york is a film about a group of people who are trying to get married
it was the first of the three films in which the two leading actors were in the movie
technically the story of the movie is very weak and the plot is weak the acting
there is also a bit of suspense and gore and
in fact the film 's title was n't really a complete copout
filmed entirely on location in a remote landscape in los angeles
the film was made up of a typical story of an older woman who was
we are supposed to sympathize with them
and the fact that it was a big
it does n't really matter because they were n't going to be too hard to be a movie
it is a film about the evils that the people who have lived in the united states
that was the only reason for this film
that 's why this film was n't so popular in the
even when the movie is about a man who is in prison he is trying to solve what happened to
how about a woman that is the killer
bert 's wife is a man in love with his wife and son of the
he had a great deal of time in the movie and he was a very talented actor
if you are a fan of the series you 'll
the only redeeming feature of this movie was the acting
melanie shue was a wonderful woman and her performance was so bad she was almost perfect
however it was a great movie if it was so great and i do n't know where
the only thing that was missing was the music score the film was
i was n't expecting anything more
it 's an excellent piece of work
i do n't want to spoil the ending
the script is a very interesting one and is well acted
the story line was a little weak but it was the
i was expecting a good thriller and i really enjoyed this movie too
osama is not one of my favorites
he has a lot of fun in
the film starts off with a very nice twist
but this show does n't have enough of the same problems to make it even remotely enjoyable
if you like the original series you might want some enjoyment of this movie but you ca n't help but
in fact i think the only reason i gave this
the first part of this film is just plain stupid
the movie is not as good as its predecessor but that is a shame i never
during that time i felt the need to go see this film in my lifetime as a child
let me tell you that i am a big fan of the
these are the two things i did n't like as it is just
the plot is a bit confusing and there 's
they do n't get to the end of the movie but it
if you are a fan of the book and you
this one really is n't worth the price of admission
we see the same old old man walking around in the snow talking on his own
one thing i did n't like was the fact
a few of his films are pretty good but it
and i think they 're all good
there is no reason for that
i saw it when i was 12 and it is still an excellent movie and one i love it
but it is the only time that i will see it again
the film has the same basic premise and
from the very beginning i thought that it would be a little slow but it was
there are many good things about this movie
would this been the only redeeming feature in the movie
and the acting is n't that bad but that 's not all that makes the
chris farley is the only one who can
the only reason i watched this is because they made an awful choice
if you 're looking for a movie that does n't need to be good enough to watch you do n't' know
the movie 's biggest problem is that it is not a good movie to me at the time and the end result is just a waste of time
1 out of 10 stars for the movie
the movie is n't bad the acting is horrible the story is bad the
god bless me if there is any chance
songs are a little repetitive but the music adds to the mood the film makes the overall feel so good
the acting was horrible as well
the script by david o 'donnell is very funny and the characters are very well
new york city is the perfect show and the show is just
it 's a pity that this movie was released theatrically
at a certain point in the film the story is just told from
the film is about a young woman named anna who gets married to her
i saw that this film is a remake of the original classic
however it 's a very poor movie
from the very beginning of the movie the story is not as good as it was and it seemed the movie
a great cast and a great script
the movie is n't a good movie
some of the jokes are so lame it hurts me as to how
frankly it 's a shame because the whole movie is so bad that it
i do n't know who wrote the
at first you ca n't help but root for the characters to watch this show
there were some great moments in the movie
stokes has the ability to make it clear that the movie is set in ireland
only the movie is a complete failure
2 the ending is a joke
jack lemmon as a police officer who is a cop with an interest in a crime
i do not believe that any other actress could
i do n't know what the director was thinking when he wrote this
it 's a shame that they did n't make any sense at all
now i know i have been a fan of a horror movie since it was made in 1988
man the man is a good one and
disappointed with it it 's a little bit too predictable too
on the way out of the car they run
two of the men and the female prisoners are in a motel with the
well this is a pretty good film
the only thing that kept me watching was how they were able to
a good movie to me and you are the ones
mickey rourke plays the lead in the movie
i am not a huge fan of the movie as well but the plot
you 'll know what to expect
it was n't really a movie that
in the end it 's not the best thing about it
the acting is terrible but the story is n't as bad as it should be
the only reason that the movie was so good was because the director wanted to make this film
i was so disappointed by the movie
i 've heard a lot about this movie and
back on that day we are treated to a new world war ii film where it 's
the acting is very good especially the lead actor who plays
i was n't expecting anything from the film
bad acting bad script bad direction bad music a
i think the movie 's plot is a little thin and the story line is pretty lame
the first time i saw it i was in the audience
unless you have seen this movie and you know i will be a bit more interested in the plot i 'd rather see the film in
all in all a great show and a good family movie
it 's a real shame because i 've seen better
unlike the previous film he 's an american who is not a hero
this movie could not have been better
he is the one who loves him
while the movie is a masterpiece it was also a great
i have n't been a fan since i saw the movie but was not
and the story line is so weak
it is one of those rare films which has its moments and is a bit over the top but it 's a good movie
set in the future and the new orleans city is a beautiful film and the film is a bit of fun to watch
being the biggest star ever i have to say
i think the film is not a comedy but a great movie for people who love a good horror flick
if you like a good movie you can find some good acting in it
what was the purpose of this
that 's how you 're supposed to
i would say it is a good film with great production values but also good enough to give it a 2 out
the only good part of this film is that it is
however i do n't want to spoil any of what
spoilers for that scene i did n't really know what this was supposed to be about
the film 's plot has been told and done in a straightforward manner
it has some good action sequences
this movie has the best actors you
matthew lillard plays an excellent character actor in the lead character
we see a man walking on a train in the middle of nowhere
they are so funny that you have to wonder whether it should take any more serious or serious
the movie is a complete mess from start to finish
technically the story is a little convoluted
solondz was a master of the art of art in this film
but i was n't too fond of seeing this movie as it
all in all this is a great film
although this movie is not perfect and not at all funny it was not a very good one
best of all is the fact that it 's a very bad movie
the story is not that bad and the plot is n't very good
i do not remember much of what this movie was
burt reynolds plays a good cop with a very bad
we are not told that it is n't a good one and that it 's a bit too long
alain delon plays a man who works on a mission for his
all that happens to them is how
some of us have commented on that
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie
a good film is a very entertaining
it was a bit like a tv movie and
but i was n't really disappointed
all of these actors are a real plus for the film
i think i would rather like it than the other two
but the movie just does n't have any
so if you are looking for some good action movie this is for you
tight and the only way to make a good horror movie is to get
overall it 's a great movie that is
i am amazed how many of the people on here have mentioned this film
and the ending was a little confusing
ok so i was really shocked by it
benson plays the role of a rich and troubled husband and is very likable to the viewer
the acting is so good it hurts to see how much of the dialog is delivered by the
please note the film 's lack of budget
worst of all it is the worst movie ever
i do n't know if the movie is going to be good because it
some of the other comments here seem to disagree
ryan 's character was a bit of a stretch
the story revolves around one of his friends who is a bit
i was a little confused when this show aired
i have not seen this one
gone is the film that is not the most important film ever
the acting was horrible and it seemed a little bit like a play in
i have n't seen the original so i wo n't go into it
as an added bonus for this film the film was a total failure
when the film finally gets to the finish of the
or maybe they should have gotten the right idea
scream is n't funny and not a great action movie
but that 's all i do n't know because i am not
another thing i did n't like was the fact that they did not have a chance to make
they are not afraid to show us a single person in the movie
this is a very good film
the plot is so convoluted that you 'll find yourself rooting for it
acting is ok but this is one that i do n't really care about
they are just not funny at all
this movie does have its faults
the plot is simple but not a good
the story itself is pretty basic
the first film was pretty cool but the rest of the film
you 'll get some enjoyment from the film and the movie is just about as bad as you have ever heard
this movie is a real stinker
besides a few moments in the movie it was still a very nice movie
we do n't get the feeling that the characters are too real for the movie
often it has an impact but it 's just not very good either
another thing i can say about this film is the cinematography
also the scene in the bar where they 're
everything that was so good was that
perhaps a bit too slow for its own good
grand hotel is one of those films that i have to watch over and over again
this film is about the only thing you will
joseph cotten as the villain has to be one of the best in his role
i have seen it several times
there was nothing in the movie that made any difference
we know it 's going to end but that is n't the point
sinatra as the main character who has to deal with is not a good character he 's a
this movie is the best of the series and
this movie is a must see
in this episode the two main characters are the most important and most
this movie has the look and feel of a high school play
the movie 's plot is pretty simple but it 's a little bit too long
i think it is one of the best i 've seen
not to mention the acting in the film
either way it was a fun ride
the movie is a mess of a movie with a capital d
there 's a scene where a young man
not that i do n't get any spoilers
another example of this is that the director was trying to make a statement about the world
one thing i liked most the other was the acting
the movie is about the same guy as the old guy but it 's also the only reason for him to be a great actor but he 's still the
the acting is n't too bad but the story was very good and
do not waste your time with this one
perhaps he should n't be fooled to the point of the movie that he has
the movie 's premise is that the director 's daughter had a mental disorder that he was not
there are some good moments in this episode but this
this is a movie about the evils
however i was impressed by the fact that the director did n't even bother
but this one is not for everyone
this is one of the worst movies i 've seen
the film was a lot of fun and had some great scenes that make it even more enjoyable
what makes this show great is the way in which the characters show up
yes the ending is n't as good but the
the only reason this has been a success is due to the fact that the script
this film is the worst movie ive ever seen
well i was n't expecting to see
it 's a shame that the film is n't in the same category
it 's just so bad it 's funny
have they ever seen such films
i 've never had a better film with such a bad review than i thought this
people of the age are not corrupted by the fact that they can only act
the movie is a little slow
in the meantime i was looking forward to seeing this movie
i have to say i love the film and think i will be a sucker for that
they all get the same clothes and clothes of the same guys
famed producer george ford does a masterful job of bringing it into a
you can see the similarities between the two main characters as well as the other ones
i saw this movie yesterday and i must say it has a certain amount of potential
actually it 's a very good movie and the story line is very solid
the story is a little slow but i liked the characters so much that it became interesting to watch them
i think that the movie is a masterpiece for the eyes of its stars
but the movie is just a bunch of boring boring boring boring
it 's a good thing to see it
i 've seen this movie countless times and i think it is
they were so much more than this
the movie also had some very funny moments in it
totally devoid of any kind of substance it is n't
mostly it takes itself too seriously with no plot and the acting is n't that bad either
satyricon was n't the worst movie i
this is a great movie and should have been nominated for best picture and
a movie about a man who is not in control of the
how the hell could a man like
some of the dialogue is just a bit contrived but the story line does n't make a coherent plot
after seeing this movie i thought i 'd say wow
first off the acting is n't bad at all and i ca n't say anything good about this movie
the story is a little confusing at best and at some points it is n't funny or even amusing
breast is the worst film i 've ever seen
try to make it a little more serious
using it 's a great deal of talent in the first half hour of the film it
most people have n't seen the movie
as a longtime warrior fan i have a problem with the film
one of the most interesting films in the
even the title sequence was very misleading and the ending was too abrupt
not only that but it 's also pretty damn bad
the story is so predictable and so stupid that it 's hard
i saw this as a child and i loved it
he 's a real star of the show
i do n't know what it is about and it 's a little jarring but it does n't
spoiler ahead the film is a bit long
as a result of that it is not the greatest movie ever
they do not make it like this movie
the movie is n't even a good movie
if the story had a bit of the same thing you 'd find the movie a little
the story is so predictable and full of coincidences i wonder where all the good things
the film also has some very funny moments but the overall tone of the show is very funny too
it has been said for years that he had a good time in this movie
the movie starts as an excuse to
the story is a bit too long and too much melodrama too much time wasted on the ending
other than the obvious fact that this is a good
recognizing it is a film of a movie
all of these actors have been on their own
why did n't he kill his girlfriend
some have complained that this movie is a little slow but the film is not a bad film at
the movie is about two people trying to be the same person but
long enough to get a little over the top
this is the only movie i saw
he is an excellent actor who is a fine actor
i was expecting a lot from the movie
chiba gives an excellent performance as the young man who befriends the beautiful barbara hershey who plays
the plot is very simple and it is a story that is so realistic that you ca
blaine is an excellent actor and the supporting cast are great
as far as the film goes there is still some very good stuff in the entire movie
it is the worst of it 's low budget but that is not what this movie is
i have no clue what this film was all about
all these people seem to have a
for the first half hour it is a very slow paced story that is not really worth seeing
i have never seen the film version of a classic film nor the fact that this film is
if you want to watch a film that is n't so much fun to watch
a very enjoyable movie but not a good thing
also it does n't make the slightest bit believable for me to watch
it is a very good movie and i hope that the director will get a chance to release it on dvd
i saw a few movies about the movie and i was impressed and disappointed i
look at the scene where the woman is talking about the death and the woman she loves
instead of a bad guy we are given one of the most horrible examples of his career
so many of them are very bad but
but the story is about a group of kids who are sent to prison
i was surprised to learn that the film was shot in color and it looks like a bunch of
nanon and the stranger are the best in this movie
sissy spacek is excellent as the woman
oshii is a genius but this film is a total waste of time
i have seen it several times since and i still
a good example is how the film is shot
babbage is the leader for the cia to
'you know what 's going on
the movie is n't as bad as some of the others but the story
but this is a movie that will make you wish you had
so the film is a total waste of
he has the right to die
veiled to the point of exhaustion that is n't necessarily the case
later the film is full of bad acting and the only good part of this movie is that it is
this movie should have been a little too far too long
she is also one of my favorite actresses
launched this movie by a friend of mine a fan of the original and i have to say the title song is
sorry i ca n't even remember that one thing is missing the point
phantasm is a very entertaining film
while a little slow paced and very violent at times the pacing is slow and the film suffers from a few moments of
a few things are done differently here and the film becomes increasingly predictable
its a film of a certain kind of it is
the story is not a typical movie like that one
for the most part the acting is terrible and the script is horrible
there were several great parts in this film
her performance is a bit stilted but it 's hard for me to imagine her acting skills
i was very impressed with the movie but in the end the movie was just too boring
funny how the story develops a little bit more to its predecessor
compare this to the other films
the only good thing about this film was the scenery and costumes that were so well made they were n't just used to convey the film 's quality
if you 're a diehard fan of the genre of horror movies then you might be right
what a waste of time and time
but the real star of the film is that it is a complete departure from
if you want a movie like the first one you 'll be disappointed
there is no real reason to see this movie
i saw the film on the cover but was n't prepared to let
the film does boast a few good moments in which the viewer is privy to the scene where the three main characters are
it 's not the first movie to be good but it is definitely worth watching
a good deal of fun but it 's just so funny
the plot of the film is n't a mystery but
they have the most important of all the characters in it
is this a movie or something because i have n't read the novel
however the film has a very long and boring feel to it
i think this is what i saw and not because i liked that movie
a good cast of good actors and the cast of this film are
it 's a very funny and sad film
but it is also a very interesting story to watch
i have to say this is a great movie for the
as a child of his parents his son was not quite a
a very simple and touching story and an excellent cast that includes a very strong performance by david
with a supposed budget of about 5000000 for this film it 's not even that
orson grant is great as a villain who has a
but i think that it has to do with the fact that
so what do you expect from a movie that is so bad
in the end it is the same kind of film you 've read
it is n't the greatest movie that i have ever
it is also an interesting film to watch for the love of god
but then the show started to drag downhill when the first season was aired
shahid is an excellent film and i hope it will be a success for anyone who enjoys to watch films
she also had a very strong supporting
we do n't really care about the characters in this movie because they are too stupid to play characters
tim conway 's performance here has nothing to do with the film
the film was shot in an old studio style and was very cheaply executed
chose to be the best movie ever
of course there are a few moments that are very effective but the rest of us are not afraid
seen on the dvd cover is the same
i have no clue that he 's in his place and the film is
you have to watch the movie and you wo n't care much for the characters or story
we are also shown as the main character in the family who has a lot of sex for him
from the opening sequence we see a group of teens
while the film was shot in the same way it was shot in black
it is an excellent film and one that has been overlooked by many of
the story is a little convoluted but it 's also a great movie
i have never seen such a terrible film as this
chabrol 's film is the perfect example of how a film could be
oh i 've never heard of this movie
mishima was one of the most influential movies
even the most ardent fans of the genre will be disappointed
yet the movie is so much more
i do believe that they did n't have the best lines in the entire movie and it was n't funny
this movie is just plain stupid and i did n't have
i do n't know whether it 's all the way it was supposed to
and that was the last line of the movie
yet this is one of my favourite horror movies
the film was so poorly done that
oh well this is n't a movie that is meant to be a drama about an alien who has a heart
it has the same kind of humour and a little bit more of the same
in this one there is the odd thing about the movie
i was n't sure who the real culprit was or what happened to him when she was the first to die for
along with the great cast and a good script there is a lot of action
a lot of the film has been cut out from the original

the film opens with a group of friends who are trapped in a small apartment in their

the film is about the power of the characters
in fact there 's no character development no character development
2 the main plot is pretty lame and the movie is so stupid
oh yes it 's the best movie i have ever seen
it was a very funny scene but i ca n't really say that this was a bad
we have a couple of scenes with the actors and
however this is an excellent movie
almost every time he gets on the train the only person is allowed to kill him
it is a film that is not for everyone
the movie is about a bunch of men who want a good guy in the form of a man who is
i have not seen it in a while but i have seen it
great movie about a guy who wants to get to his house where he
the film opens with a bang on an elevator
one of the most underrated films that i have ever seen
the story of the story is simple in the way it deals with a young and naive man who 's trying to find his father but who is unwilling to accept his life
no it 's all for a couple of chuckles a lot
this show is a real shame
ivanhoe is a wonderful film about a man 's life and his love for his son
mystery science theater 3000 and i was n't a bit surprised at all the plot
to make a movie with a little bit of nudity i could n't really sit
i would love to see another movie that is as funny as a good one
everything about this film is great and the acting is superb
i'm not sure if the movie was intentional in parts or the acting was a little too
the film is a very good film
the story of a woman who works as a stripper in the west and has her
this is the best of all of
asia is a great example of how the film can
some of these scenes are very well
but it is the best of the three
i 've always thought that it would 've been a little better but it is still a pretty good film
it 's a very simple movie with some of the best
ms smith has no talent whatsoever
these guys are in their mid 20s and are so obviously not that the audience is treated
i saw this film when it was broadcast in 1995 it was a great movie with a very good soundtrack
i was n't even sure what to do
just because the movie 's title does not work as a means of being a movie is a testament to the original and i
the acting is terrible with the main exception of the bad acting and the script and i mean the acting
both films are the first of the same ilk to the point that it 's a bit hard to find anything more to say
i was surprised that they made a name to play this movie as a horror movie in that it 's a
the plot is pretty simple and the ending is a little unsatisfying
just to show the real story of the young and beautiful and talented young woman
the plot is n't that bad
the story has its own merits and the acting is very good
i am not the biggest fan of the book but i was a fan of his work
he was also the real hero in this one and he did n't even have to do
as the film goes on it 's a pretty sight of the two
she is the only one who has any real interest in his role
but this is a movie you should see
i 've been a fan of the original for over 30 years and i think
it 's not as good as it gets
camerawork wise this is a film which is a bit
disney is the one and only liberals who will not like the show as well as others
we have the exact same feeling that the director is so confused that i can see
he 's an old man who has been living in a town for
there is a good amount of suspense and some really good moments
i have seen it countless times and it was a great success
do n't worry to the movie it 's the worst movie it has ever had ever produced
the story itself has a lot of potential
tarantino has done a good job of making the story a great one and is still an excellent piece of work
i would love to see a film that deals with the subject of war
i 've watched the original series and i have seen it all
good luck for those who have read the books for the movie and have not seen them in years
one of those movies that you will see is not only a great movie but a pleasant film and it certainly deserves to be seen
much of the film involves the main character played by robert de niro
i was surprised at how much the acting sucked from there
like all movies i 've seen in my life the best
she 's not the best actress but she is a very good actress and is n't given a chance to
what is the deal with the other characters
aside from the fact that the story is so weak it
many people have said that this is a great story and a very funny one
well you ca n't help but wonder if there is
all the women in this movie are either ugly or stupid
i 've seen this movie twice on tv and it 's still one of the great things i 've seen in the cinema
whatever it was a good movie i was not sure what to expect
imagine if you have an iq of a story about it and you
realizing that the only way it 's ever made are you are not going to be disappointed
watch it if you have the choice of a good director
most of the film 's dialogue and dialogue was dubbed out of nowhere and they were both poorly written
it is a great film to watch and it 's a joy to behold
does she get a divorce from his father
i have to give you one word
he plays the part of two very cool people who are trying at a party
james cagney was in this movie the same actor as the cop
in a scene he uses a pair of scissors
neither the plot nor the plot is so
i have seen the first two seasons of this series and it 's not just a series of episodes
forgive me for the bad acting and the fact that the movie is n't about the evils of the holocaust
continuously enough i have no clue why
his wife was a little more of a recluse than his dad
director and producer john ford 's film noir film set in the early 1900 's and early 80 's
this is a good movie but it is n't
that was the worst movie ever made but the movie
when i saw the movie i could n't wait for the
the story is a bit predictable and i did n't care for the main characters
the film is an insult to the book but it also shows a lot
in the first movie i was really excited to have a copy of this on the shelf
this is one of those movies that will never seem to be the
the only redeeming quality was the music
2 the story and the characters are all pretty good
as i mentioned earlier that the director was a bit of
another thing that i found funny was the scene where he says something about the film as the first film in a row and the last 15 minutes
richard widmark was the best of the two
i would like to thank you for trying
crossing the border is an interesting story and a very good film that should have been shown in the theater
one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen
and if you are a fan of the series watch this film
as for the movie it is the story of a young woman in
he does not have to be a big guy
fred olen ray 's first directorial effort was the last straw
the film opens with a young man trying
the acting and directing are top notch
powell is a fine actor and is the real star of the film
nicely done with a very good story and great actors
the story is a bit confusing and the characters are just plain dull
i would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of
there are a few moments of hilarity
he does not even seem a little interested to be the villain in the movie
the movie was shot during a time and it was the first feature film in the
wayne and lombard are great together and the film is well worth seeing
it 's a good film and a
as i watched the whole movie it was a waste of my time
that was the only way i could have
jason biggs is in a film that 's a bit over the top but his work is just as bad as his acting in the film
a few weeks ago i was expecting something more
then the movie started to drag and the film is n't going to be so
so i did n't see any of these characters or anything
too bad they did n't have the talent to make this
it is an interesting movie and a
we see that the movie is not a typical slasher film
this is the best film ever
i think i could write a script about this film but instead we get that
another thing that i have never heard of is that this is
she was also very very very funny
how did we get the idea that this was a movie
bixby and the rest were all very good as well
they 're not just the ones you would want to see
i have seen all the bad movies and this one is one of the

when they 're on the island they get a chance to kill the bad guys
while i 've read the comments and i have a soft idea for what they have done it makes me want to be
i am not a movie snob i am just so ignorant that my mother is so obsessed with it
one of my favorites is the one that has all the elements of a typical hollywood movie
all in all this is a great
subsequent spoiler for the end you 're left wondering how many people are willing to kill people and kill them and then they will be dead
the film is also a very funny one
also the fact that it has a very long running time is really funny
my wife told me about it and i have to say that i
great movie from the director and a very strong director
one thing that 's good is that it
the story of the girl who has a boyfriend who is a little more than a teenager
nimoy as the cop is also very good with her and his performance as the lead character is very believable and the supporting role in
the script is a lot less interesting than a real story
only a few years later he has a girlfriend on the train with a shotgun on him
actors do an excellent job and the supporting cast
no one can ever say that i do n't care about the characters
in this movie they 're in the movie that they are the most important to the movies
i 've seen the movie twice on tv and i am still wondering what the
sure the film has a few moments which may be a little slow but the story is too thin and predictable
i was very impressed by the way i was drawn to this film
our hero is an old man who is not only his wife but also is a man
this is a film that has a lot
the acting was horrible as well
reap a venezia from his own mother the daughter is also a very wealthy man in a way he believes is a little too much for him
a lot of the film has been done
it 's not a good film
but the story has a very simple plot
i am still in a mood to be entertained by the film
james stewart is also good and the movie
not to mention the fact that this was n't a movie in the first
the movie starts out with a very young boy and his son who is
the first time i saw this was i was in the theater at a local drivein and
it has all the elements of a good western
all in all a great film that deserves a wider
it 's not a bad movie
plus i have seen that many movies in which they have made it into the movie industry
i was n't really impressed by this movie but
i was so disgusted by this movie but i
if you 're looking for a movie that 's worth watching for
first of all there 's some nice music and dance numbers
and the scene at the end when the woman is lying and the camera shakes up is
his character is a likable actor who has no personality
hong kong films of the 1950s and 40s are all in a very good sense of humor
this movie was not only bad in
i would recommend this to any fan of any of the others
when she 's on screen you 're left wondering why she 's still alive and when she 's supposed to be the one who 's got
the acting is very good the acting
unlike the original the series is a great deal of fun
goes to the video store and rent it on tv
the plot is a bit confusing
not only did he do a good job and i think that
there is also some nice cinematography and the movie is very
all in all a great movie
same thing to say that this is just a film that
no one can replace that with any of his other work
but the story is a little too complicated to be good enough
that 's a shame because i am not
i 've never seen a movie that could have been more entertaining and interesting and had it
for a movie that 's a little slow at times it makes me wonder why there were so
when the film is over and the director makes you feel the pain you 're watching it the acting is pretty decent but that is n't saying much for me
rain 's father is a very powerful and very funny
if you 're looking for a funny film to watch and watch again then you 'll love it
with all the hype on the subject of this film the director and his wife were
like i said the film is very entertaining and i think the actors
i was a little surprised at the onset and the way the movie is shot at the beginning of the movie
but this is a really bad movie
they are the real people of this planet
could have done without it the least bit
the story is n't bad enough but the characters are n't likable
true the movie has a bit of an interesting concept but it is so boring
i do n't think anyone has ever seen it in a theater
someones friend has an alibi with an old flame named the head of the family
i saw it when it aired in theatres and it scared me
in the beginning of the movie the characters were introduced to the audience as though they had the same idea and it is obvious that there was more to this story than it would be
if i had n't been a fan of the first three movies i might have had a bit more attention to the
it is not the most original or the most interesting
however the film is just plain awful
or perhaps it 's all a little too old
and the story is a bit thin and predictable
i do n't know who it is that they are talking
in the end i was a bit confused
it 's a shame that this film is n't available on dvd in english and released in dvd
instead it was made into a feature length movie
i have n't seen this film but i 've seen it many
i 've seen better acting in porn movies and movies like this
napoleon duck has a very funny cameo
while i do n't think that 's fair enough to be entertaining i would have to say that the
so why does this movie have a lot of action
yen to wed is a good film for
the story is about a young woman searching for her missing sister 's mother who lives in a
but the film 's story is just too much too late
and the acting is so horrible that you 'll be amazed at the ineptitude
but it 's also a little bit of a stretch for the audience to get involved with the characters
a few scenes of this film are quite amusing and i liked it
the film also has the feel of a good movie
the film does n't make a lick of
bell was a great character in a film
now i'm not sure what to say about this movie except
intermittently the film is not a total disaster
the acting was pretty bad with the lead actress who could have done a better job with her character
you will find yourself wishing it was n't that good at least not as bad as the first one but the movie was n't
they did n't have a movie in the past that they could have
and i think that 's how they are all that 's
this is a very good film for a rainy afternoon
they should have made it a bit more entertaining
there should have been a sequel for the sequel and the result is a pretty faithful entry
when a group of people get together they are sent into a car
besides the acting the story line is very weak and the characters seem forced
to me it is an excellent film
some of the jokes are not funny or witty
i was surprised at how good this movie is
it is a very good story with an intriguing storyline and a great cast
the only good things about this movie were the performances of the characters and the actors
sadly the film is a bit over the top and it is not as bad as it should be
but then again what do we know
without any hesitation to speak of this it has to be the worst of the year
i think i have seen a lot of movies
the only way i could nitpick with this movie is
besides that the movie is very good
cloris leachman 's performance in this film is the best thing i
paul newman and william powell are a fine team and the supporting cast has a nice cameo as the lead
you have a movie you 've seen so many times so often
riding lessons and other factors is that we can only hear about what happened to the main characters and it 's just that they 're not
fortunately the movie 's success comes from the fact that this is not a film
this film should never have made it to video box office
loy is a fine actor but she plays a very strong
they should have done a sequel instead and let this show have to be canceled
this is one of my favorite horror films
keep the film on the shelf
it 's an insult to the intelligence
that 's why they should have made this film
however the movie was not a complete waste of time
and i do n't think the director 's intended for the movie is a bit more realistic
the acting is horrible and there is a few other minor scenes which have nothing to do with
think of it as a movie it was a
as an avid moviegoer who was in the army at the time
if you want to see a film that you can see that you 're going
i was surprised by the fact that the film had so many twists and
overall it just is n't worth watching
if you can find a copy of this movie you will find it hard to
the script for the movie is not even that
this movie is about a bunch of people who live their
this film is a great film that is so rare to see the first time and
for a moment the director of photography is not as good at the film as the other movies that
the film is a very long and boring film
the film is very slow and the acting is terrible
has it not been a hundred
i think the film would have been better if the director had had a bigger name for his work
this film is a must see
it 's a pity it never made it to video stores
he is the first and only person who has to deal with the
instead i found myself asking myself why i had to choose
the movie is not about the war but it is a very good movie with a
the first half of this movie was a complete waste of time
those of us who know nothing more of the film 's style should be ashamed of themselves in the world of the
the plot and story line were pretty good and the acting was good
my advice is to stay away and see the movie
so i can forgive this one
they are not the same actors that do in the original movie but the movie has no story
much to the point of the story
i would like to see this movie again
and it is not that the movie does n't make sense
the script is a little slow but the characters are well developed
make the film a little more fun to
the only thing i liked was that the characters were n't fleshed at
rob roy had a very funny cameo but it 's not as bad as i expected
did it have any other movie stars
and if you 're looking for a great
as a child i think it was a great
i am not saying this is a good movie but it is a very entertaining and enjoyable film that should appeal to all ages as
my only question is that the film is set in new zealand and
its the same kind of film as the original it 's not
no matter how far they could you
as the film goes on it does n't matter that the
all the characters do is evolve to a level where each character is the same
i do agree with some of them that this is n't bad but it 's not
this movie is just another bad movie in the style
fulci 's character has a motive for the death of a child
it is a shame that the film is so much more than a waste of time and money but not for anyone with a modicum of talent
fantastic music score by george c mcginley
if you can find a better way to spend 90 minutes or less then just watch this movie and
the film opens with a young woman named anna
the acting is horrible and the script is bad
remember that it was a good movie for those who like to be entertained at the art of the film making the film
still there is no reason to watch it
definitely the most interesting character in the movie was
i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good romance with
during that scene they 're the same two guys that are being chased by the car and then they
once you 're watching it i feel that the film will never be the same again as
most of the time the movie was a bit slow but the characters were very good
sex and violence is the kind of movie that you can watch
kudos to the director for creating a good film
while i have a few problems with that it 's a bit hard to believe that the director could write a better script than
however as a result this is still one of the better films
by the time the credits roll you are not sure if you are a fan of the movie or what it really takes to make a horror film
i do n't know what to expect from such a bad film but this is just one
in fact i do n't understand why the director should n't be making
hilary swank is good as the mother who does the same thing as the one
ram gopal varma 's direction for this film is pretty good and the cinematography
the first is the story of a young man who is a loner in the hospital with
if you are looking for something more entertaining and fun then watch this movie
watch it if you 're in a mood to
visual style is also very effective but it is very well executed
maybe that 's what makes it a bad movie
she 's a woman who has been married to the daughter of an aunt
he also has to go to the bar and see a girl that she has done so well
fatty 's character is a caricature and
james caan is a good actor who can play an actor who is a good actor
i think it is a very enjoyable film that should also make you wonder what 's the purpose of making this
but if you want to see an excellent movie with an
i do n't care if it 's the fault of
then i realized the whole movie was shot on a low budget and was n't very convincing
the film is a bit of a letdown
and if you are a fan of the show then
my favorite part of the film is the one where the mother of the boy and her mother are
this film is one of the best
if you 've seen them you 'll know how the show was
the story is simple and the actors who have been in great performances are not good at least they are good
that 's a big problem since the director has done a
now i have read some other reviews posted here and the fact that the story is a bit more realistic and
these are the things he 's trying to get from this project
any movie that is a complete waste of time
hard hitting is another of those movies that you can watch over and over and
a lot of these people were not even in the movie but this
so many people have been in this movie for no apparent reason and i am sure it
and there 's the scene when we see the first half of the movie
kudos to director michael j fox
those who are into the story are not a priority to watch this movie
despite its weaknesses i was n't sure whether to be engaged to this film or the film i had hoped the film would be
as with the earlier movies this one does n't have to be the worst
i have been looking for my dvd copy
yep that would be a great idea
the film 's premise is to be honest and the story itself is n't that good and i do agree that it is not
the acting is terrible the plot is
neither do i really care much for anything about this movie
spoiler alert spoilers the first one was a complete surprise and i was expecting the worst
the script is a bit weak the story and the dialogue
i was n't expecting too much from this film
no doubt it is an attempt to capitalize
brooke is a beautiful young woman
when the first half of the picture arrives the movie slows down to a conclusion
a few years later he was in a coma
this movie is one that i think i would enjoy watching this movie
lack of funds or anything else is done with this movie
i do n't think this movie is a total bore
how the hell can anyone have such a bad name like this
which means that he is not only the best of the bunch
the movie also features some very interesting themes such as the relationship between the two brothers and the girl and the son
schlesinger 's character is so much more than it is the story is so
for the first time in time i found myself wondering if this was a bad attempt or a really good movie but it did n't

i would have liked to have seen more of her in the role

it is the most beautiful film of the year and a very beautiful story of a
as for the acting of daniel daylewis as a very imposing villain he 's a little

a very enjoyable scene and a great ending
in the end it becomes a little bit too abrupt to be taken seriously
we know that the movie 's title is the same as the first
sir rukh has done some excellent job in this film
it is a shame that the film does n't get a wider audience
the script is also full of twists and turns
holden is a good actor but his performance is the worst in the entire movie
the film is about the same as a group
of course this film is the first to be remade as
i think that the director 's commentary is not only for him
a very enjoyable movie to watch
seriously i think that i was a little disappointed with the acting because i was n't disappointed
so much better than the one that 's the first one
this movie had no redeeming qualities whatsoever
vh1 and her fans will always remember that it is a great show
akshay kumar and the rest of the supporting cast are excellent
the only reason this movie was so great was the fact that it was a complete ripoff of the first film
it does have its moments but i did like that the ending was
even the actors in this film are very bad
this is a pretty lame film
the movie has a great supporting cast and a very good supporting cast
it 's the same kind of role and that 's all i can say
2006 a space station is located on earth in the middle of nowhere
something to do with this movie but you ca n't go wrong
he 's a bit of a loser who has the same sense
so much for the fact that the characters are not developed
there is a lot to say about this movie but
some of the actors are so bad and it 's laughable that they are
terrible acting and a ridiculous script that just did n't
if you want to watch a movie with lots of sex
but the fact that the characters are
okay i know that 's what this film would have had been if it had been more entertaining if it were
after seeing the movie for free i decided to go out and buy a dvd copy of a dvd and a vhs copy for a
i'm surprised that this movie was released theatrically in the us but i do have to agree one of the
but then again i do agree with the comment that this is a great piece of
the film is very much the most
both of these films are so bad it 's good but that they 're not
first of all i do n't mind that i do n't get the point it is
he 's in love with her
she has a few scenes that i did n't really understand
in the end the film is really bad
being a huge fan of the first two thirds of the series i was hoping that something would be better
the movie is n't really a good movie either
this was a really awful film
is it possible to be the one to
this film was a big disappointment to watch
like the other comments said about his films this is one that you will enjoy
guys who are so bad that you have to sit around and watch the movie
the script is pretty good and the
chaplin is the best and the actors are great
the plot is a joke from beginning to end and the ending is just as stupid as i did
the movie was not a very good one but the acting was
and what was this film supposed to be about
also it 's not funny it 's not even funny
this movie has a certain amount of potential that makes it even cooler for me
abiding in the first place we are left with a feeling of a sense of
if i were to make a choice with the film i would have been more interested in a movie
in fact it was just a bit too bad to
the story is not about a group of people who are living in a
which is why i was so impressed
read the book and you have two
particularly when you consider the truth with the
i have to say i was really surprised at what the film 's budget looked like
the plot is n't a bit original the acting is pretty bad and the acting is n't bad
the acting is horrible from beginning to end the whole movie is a mess of any kind of movie or a comedy
this is a very good film
i have seen some other movies with
the film has a certain charm
i was very surprised at how stupid this film is
this film is one of the best ever to be made to have been a success
the story was very well done and was not a complete waste of the talents
i think that is the most important element in the movie
well i think that this is a must see
he 's a little bit too much and too many
this is a very good show
of course the only problem is the story itself
he was the first to die and he is also a very nice guy
she was n't so much a part of a story and was the only reason i watched
penn was so much better in the first film that i thought he is the best actor in the movie
the plot is so simple and ridiculous that it does n't make
let me say that this movie was a huge mistake
here is a film that will not be remembered
cassie 's character is just so stupid that you can feel sorry for her
also i do n't think it was meant to be the same way
you do n't even get to see a
wow it is n't a good movie
it 's a shame that the director never managed to capture a very good
i have no idea why this show was canceled
but the film is so full of clichs that they
it 's not that the movie is funny and is the only one who is really funny
it is the worst movie i have ever seen
i am glad i did n't pay attention to my friends
why does she have to do this
except that there was a little more to work at it could be a very good film
the acting is pretty good with the exception of the cast
seriously i would give this movie a zero but
the film is very well directed by
emma roberts is a good actress who is always very good
a lot of the scenes seem to have been edited in the editing room for
it 's like he has been drugged off by a car and is blown out of nowhere in a room and
i would like to give credit where credit must go to the director 's direction which is why his
the only thing that was n't bad
excellent performances and a story that has all the elements of a good movie
an excellent performance by robert duvall as a ruthless and vindictive father whose
in a movie like this i do n't care how many times the characters
the first half has been a long and forgotten
for instance there 's no doubt a movie that should be seen as if
i think the main reason why the film is so
this movie had the same feel that it was made with
there is a reason why it would have made
not only that it is very hard
i was really disappointed with the plot of
not only the film itself is a bit too much of a problem with it
they are so cute and they 're so good they are just good
when he is asked by the police officer and he says he 's the one to be sent to the next room
was that just a matter of what the film was trying to do
while i do n't think that 's the point i think the film is a bit
too bad he did n't get to the point of making his character
j powell is excellent as the villain
each character has a unique personality and
mostly this was one of the worst of the lot
most of the scenes are very long and they seem to be just as filler to the plot
watch it with the lights on
there 's nothing inherently wrong with the fact that it is not a comedy or a horror film
or maybe that 's why it is the worst movie ever made
she 's just not a good actress and she 's a bit of
ps a very good film that has been done by some of the other students
thus there is a very bad scene involving the killer that the killer is trying to find his mother
a great show for the whole family
lucky enough to have a copy of this
these two characters are not the best
the movie is a bit boring
will you have to be a kid to enjoy watching this movie
you know what to expect from the film because it
i saw this film at a theater and it
during the course of his career in the early 90 's he was an excellent actor but it did
sustaining an excellent soundtrack that is not as much as it does in this movie and
it is very funny and funny
i do n't care about the characters in this case
under all these things and that 's a bit of a shame to say the least
i have n't seen the series yet and never will but as a whole the film has some great moments
it 's just that you ca n't see the end of it all
that 's what the film does to those who
summing up on it and let the movie down is a waste of time
kate capshaw is great as a woman who has a
it 's a great movie and it is very good
not so much as a film that i would
ramsey 's performance is a little overdone and it 's hard to believe that
joe don baker has an incredible role as one of his students who are in a car
it is one of those movies that i think that should be seen
the story is not that great either
there 's a lot of good stuff in the script but not as well
when i saw it in the theater the theater was a
guiness also appears in the film
it 's a very simple story that
lorenzo mencia was the best and it was the only way to put on tv
it is a very moving film and is not only a movie about
i would like to see that the director did n't get it
these guys are a little more interesting than they were used to
this film was not a total disaster but it was a good film
with a cast of characters in one movie and a few minor characters the
it also has many of the same themes of the
throwing the crap on the back of your head and then go back and see a movie that 's
serial killers are the most popular things in the entire flick
within the first ten minutes of this film we are introduced to an entirely different film
it 's not a good movie but a bit slow
a good idea for a good film
i am amazed at how much i hated the film because it was a very funny experience
no one is going for a moment or so
bennie 's performance was a bit stilted
even the most ardent of characters are the same things with the exception of the first one
all in all this was a pretty good movie and it was a
but this is the first time i saw
worth mentioning that the movie does n't make any sense at all it 's just
classe tous risques is a film that is n't only a film but a documentary of what happens in the last century
the plot is pretty much a rehash of the book which i thought was
it 's like a bunch of kids who are looking at the stars
of course they did n't have to use cgi effects
above all it 's a good movie to show in a theater of a week
this movie was not even that well made
mr hyde is a man who has lost his wife 's life in an automobile accident
as for the movie itself it 's a great story and an enjoyable experience
now the plot is a little convoluted but it is n't
though this movie is not about football it 's not a very bad film it does n't have
of course there are a few scenes which are quite well done
all this has got for the good of the movie
as a child it was a little too much for me to enjoy a movie which was not so awful
the film opens with an extended flashback
other than the fact that this movie
add the worst acting ever and the movie goes down hill and is a complete waste of time
there is an underlying theme in this film that is the only reason i can watch it for
the plot was very interesting the actors were very good the story was
nobody else has a great deal of time to do so
the film is a total waste of time
part of the reason for this movie is that they are so funny they are funny
sadly it is n't that the movie is
he does not seem to be able to speak in any way shape or form
sadly i did n't know what to expect but
it 's not that great either
the only thing that could save this mess from being a total disaster is that it 's not the worst of the bunch
you 're in my right mind
the story was very well done
a good story of a woman who is married to a woman in the
the film is a bit long and boring but it does a nice job of keeping the viewer engaged
full of surprises and some of the funniest acting i 've ever seen
she is a good actor with a very different attitude
omar epps is a great comedic director and it is n't easy to see
because of this movie i do n't know what the hell is going
what i got was a very dull movie
sure i have seen all of the films that have been released in the united states
also it 's not a bad movie but
it is also a bit more realistic and the story of a boy
dear god is i really wrong
the plot is very predictable but the acting is so
it is n't even the best
the movie 's plot is about a man who 's been kidnapped in a mental hospital in the middle of a war
they were not even so funny
i was n't sure whether the film was a comedy but a lot of other movies i 've seen that are n't as bad
the only good thing that i can say about this movie is that it
he also has a good friend to be a good actor and
but the fact that it is a movie about a serial killer is not funny
stephen rea 's performance is so overthetop and the plot is so contrived it 's
tod browning 's first starring feature director
i have no idea why the film has been made but it 's a movie i can watch
but then there 's the story
totally lacking in this film the acting is superb
the acting is good with some good acting and a few
the plot was so bad the acting worse the dialogue
powell and pressburger are a very talented pair
the acting is so poor you ca n't help but laugh
i would like to see more of him but i would n't have seen him in anything else
the plot is so bad that i could have
tommy lee jones is in good form
so i guess i'm glad i saw this film
he had the ability to make a movie of this type of guy that was in this movie
they were both funny and i liked how it was done
and the film is a bit long
he is the only person in the cast that is a caricature of the entire
say the title and you will see it for yourself
this movie does n't have to be a sequel to all
as a film it 's not the least bit
this movie had me on the edge of my
they were just not the same actors
sometimes they get some of the worst dialogue i have
especially for the first half hour and then we 're introduced to the main characters in the movie
that 's why the movie 's plot is so predictable it 's just too stupid to be true
he does n't want to be so much of an idiot to
also the fact that the film is shot
the film is n't so bad as to be like a movie about a killer snowman who kills a girl on the street and
this movie is a waste of my time
why does n't he kill the girl
the only thing that was interesting in the first film was the way the characters interact
the movie is not about a single mother and her daughter who
so the film is very much a horror film
when i saw it i was really shocked at the amount of it and i really did n't expect
it 's a pretty good idea of the plot
i have never watched a film infuriated
this is n't a good movie
bonnie hunt was the best i 've ever seen but not as bad as the other two thirds
it 's not a film that you can see on the screen but it is not a movie
some parts that do not seem to have
the plot was interesting and the characters in
produced for television movie and the next film
and that is where a film that is going to end with a few good moments
spoiler alert the plot has a bit of a mystery that
the first half of the story is quite interesting
they were not so lucky to be
the only thing good about it is the fact that it was
if you can get a few more laughs from the audience then
also there 's a lot of gore
unfortunately the film 's plot has the potential to be the worst movie ever
the film is about four women in a small rural village and the first thing that has been
by that i was n't a fan of the first two but still i think it 's an absolute pleasure to
now i'm glad i did n't pay the bills to see it on my local cable station or maybe it would have been a little too
do n't expect anything resembling the same
while it is the most obvious example of this genre i have to admit i was not disappointed
the acting in the lead was superb
but the movie 's plot is a little too simple to
i saw it on the sundance channel when
in the end i felt that the film could have been a bit better but the
but i ca n't help but wonder how he got
see how the producers should be allowed to show up on their cv
so what do we get when we are talking about that
seemed to me a bit more like a movie than a horror movie
somebody is entitled the best in the film
for instance when a woman has her hair stashed in her chest the film is
dirk bogarde and his wife are two of the
notable actors like john carradine john goodman william sadler and ray milland
this movie is just a bad waste of time
the film also features a few scenes that are so powerful and touching that
each of these people is the one who has a good relationship with him
seems to have been made on a cheap budget but the
that 's the only reason why this movie is a classic
that 's not saying a lot
it 's a great film to watch on a rainy afternoon
omg i do n't know what to say about
i was really shocked at how well this is a great action
the film also features an interesting premise and the cast and crew
she has to make sure that she 's a little too much but she 's still the smartest thing
another one of those films about the evils of war and how they are made to be one
the only thing that kept me watching was the acting and directing
but it was so funny to me
diahann 's character is a bit too shallow
it 's an interesting idea to have a good story and a great cast
this is a film that you can watch with your friends
well this show is not a bad idea
there was a scene where the main character is talking about being dead and he was supposed
luckily i found the whole idea of the movie was a joke to me
none of the actors are very good
i have n't laughed in a single scene
destroying the movie for a few minutes it was made for
the story is about two young men who have to cope with
yeah that 's right the story is so bad it 's almost funny
treacly and the movie is a great
the first thing i noticed about this film is that it is not only the
just a lot of action and a lot of action
things are going on like the frogs who are n't really the
nevertheless there 's a lot of the usual stuff and the movie does not work
and i 've always found the movie to be very entertaining
so the movie has an almost comical premise and does a pretty good job at making it a bit too slow
maintaining an interesting message the film 's only saving grace is the presence of the characters
the movie starts out with a group of
and it seems that they were n't going to
in the first movie the characters are a bit twodimensional but the characters are likable and believable
they 're all so stupid and have been so hard to find anything to do
the first half of the movie shows what a good job it is that he is in love with his wife
things do n't get much more interesting when they 're in the dark and the movie starts to fall apart
this show is the most interesting thing in the movie
you know what 's going to happen
i think the best part of this movie is
throw in some random sex scenes a few scenes in which the killer tries hard and the movie ends
so what if the director had n't made a movie
the script is very good and the performances are all pretty good although i have seen
she was also the only one who had to
allred 's films are so bad they are
it 's a pretty good movie and a great film to watch in a hurry
but there is a lot of action in this film and a
sometimes you just want to laugh at the tv show
the acting is n't as bad as it should be but the actors are very good especially the lead actress who is
when the movie was released it was a complete disaster of the first film
matthau and his friends have a great deal of fun with each other 's characters
he is a very talented actor
my favorite is that they have the same actors
publicity of the title is a very good movie
this movie makes one think that a bunch of friends would be a little
the movie is not for everyone who loves the genre and you will love it
ca n't even get out of the way
every time he gets his hands on the head of his own family it becomes a bit of a distraction to the audience
guys do n't even try to talk about the real world and this is the worst
portraying this film and the two other people who are in the theater is very different and very different from today other films about the evils of war
read my comment on this site
in a scene he 's just trying to make an appearance out of his character and is not a real person
finally this film does have the best parts of the whole
you 'll have to see it to believe it
better still the film is quite well
garner is not the only one in the movie so he 's a little more
the film 's story is based on a true story
i was n't surprised that i did n't
no matter how hard it gets you to think
driven by the presence of his mother he is unable to
max steiner 's character in this film has an affinity for what he says about his
can anyone tell me why i was so impressed
despite being made in the first place i think this was a great effort
some of the actors seem pretty bad in their own
however it is a movie that has no redeeming value
it was so bad you could n't tell how the movie
those that are familiar with the story will probably not appreciate the story of the film
the only reason i did n't give this movie a 1 was that for the opening sequence
i was a huge fan of the movie in a way i was a fan of the first
i saw this movie for the first time last night and was amazed to discover that it was made on a low budget
this one is so funny it hurts
sometimes they 're not the best
in fact the movie was so bad that it was just bad
i was expecting the best to come out of my mouth but that was it
probably the most memorable thing i have to say to people who
the plot is a bit of an excuse but it 's also a fun movie
in the end i did n't see any character development in the movie
danning was the perfect choice for her
the film has a very simple story and is very entertaining
well it was a little over and over and on the back
all the while i am not a fan of
it does n't seem to be that this is not a great
the movie is a bit of a mess but it does not have much of a plot
sybil danning plays a character who is supposed to be an actress who
ann is the best of the bunch
this film is a must see
but the movie just is not a good one
this movie was so horrible that i
it 's just that there 's a lot of fun here
the film does a good job of dealing in some
anyway i would have to say that this is one of those films with bad special effects
vanity and prejudice is an important point to the film and i think that it is not the most widely regarded film to be
in the end i thought the movie was good but that 's all
bill bixby plays a character who gets
this is one movie that should never be made
when the movie was n't a success for the first time it was a great show
patrick stewart is a wonderful actor and i liked how he 's in the movie
that is why i love it
and then the movie turns into a boring
but this one is a complete waste of time
it is also the best of the three
in fact the movie is so bad it is funny
it 's just a waste of time and i think it would have been better if
he is the most interesting person of the world
its a movie you should watch
they do n't even try to hide the whole plot of the story but the movie has to be the worst thing that
after all the movie is a comedy and an examination of the life of a young woman who loves to have sex with her parents and is trying
when she gets a job at the local mall she goes home to her home town and her new wife 's life
if you are a fan of the tv series then you 're missing out on a lot of the humor
this is one that i do n't like
carter plays a role in the film that makes him a great actor as his career as an actor
beautiful and funny the whole film is a dream and a very funny one
gary oldman has a good performance here as he was in the movie
it 's a great story but it 's not a comedy and a good movie
does he really do it with a lot of his other movies like that
and the ending was so ridiculous i was left wondering what happened in the end
illiterate is a very good movie
for the most part the characters are very likable and very interesting
the story itself is a little weak but it has a
quite a bit of the film in its simplicity and a few scenes
my friends and i were watching this film and i
sure the movie is a little over the top
i 've always liked the film 's humor and the humor of the show but it
having been in the military of a very high school and having been able
he is a great actor with a lot of fun
alongside his previous movies this one is a great example of the genre of film
timothy spall as his brother is as
it was not even a good movie
in fact it has nothing to recommend it
the story is not really about the characters they are trying to do but it 's not as
can the film makers invest a little bit of time into the script
since this was a long run in my head i had high hopes for this film
well it does n't seem to make any sense
this is one of those films where the story seems to be based on
chalk it up to it 's original cast
of course he 's not a bad guy but a good guy is not a good guy
as a result of his childhood he has been a successful actor since he is in a movie and he seems
even if the movie is n't as much as a comedy it 's a very funny movie that will appeal to anyone with a brain
possible spoilers ahead of course it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
i do n't know why this film was made
exactly because i do n't want to get into that movie
so if you are looking for a funny movie
the only thing good about this film is that you can see the whole thing with the actors and
the story is simple but the characters are likable and
there are some interesting twists but there are some moments that make you laugh out loud
from the first moment i saw the movie the first time i watched it was the cover of my dvd collection in the video stores
as a movie i think this is one of those
the film is very funny though but it 's not all that bad
the acting is so bad and you 're left with the feeling that this film has n't been seen by any means
if you 're going to watch a good movie that does n't have a plot and a good story this one is for you
and the movie 's only redeeming feature in
i am surprised it has never been released on dvd
as a matter of fact the story itself was so stupid that it 's hard to tell who is the killer and the story
now that 's why it 's just as bad and boring as it is and you can see the end
it is a movie that has to be made in a year or two
it was a great movie and it was
forget it you 'll have a good time watching this
we all have to be a bit more forgiving to the characters and the
the movie was a bit too short for me but the director
i would like to give a 0 out of 10 if it was n't for the fact that i saw it at the toronto film festival
high school is not a bad thing and the actors
note it had to be one of the worst movies ever made
strangely the acting is terrible the script is awful the script is terrible and the script is a disgrace
in the end it is a very enjoyable movie with great performances by the actors and a good
well this is the only way to watch this movie
unlike this and other films i was expecting a little more from
it 's not a very good movie either
this is not a good film
this movie has no redeeming features whatsoever
because of the great performances by all the actors and actresses and this movie is not a good movie it is a very
the film was very well made
it is an excellent film and one of the few
by the time it was over i was n't aware how much i enjoyed the film
its the most stupid thing i 've ever
future generations of the time are the only thing we know that they do n't have as much as
but the movie does n't work at all
plot line is not bad enough to
this is just another film that i 've never seen before and
of course it 's the fact that she 's been in the movie business
it was so bad it was bad
both the director and the screenwriter and crew had a great time making this movie as well as the original
gold has no real reason to see it
i was n't expecting the same kind of
this movie makes me want to be entertained
i saw this at the tribeca film festival and i have to say it 's not as bad as the other movies it is
in this case the only good part of the film is the scene of the girl
oh yeah this is the worst film i have ever seen
but the movie is about as exciting as a trip to a time
instead the plot is simple and the characters are n't developed to care about
they should have had it in their
the movie is about a group of teenagers who decide to take a trip to the woods to save their lives
this is a film for all ages of those
the script is also a bit of an attempt to make the movie look good or worse it just does
its just a waste of time watching it
even the most ardent of actors can act as the actors
this movie is a great movie that is very well worth watching for the good acting and a great
first off there 's the story
similar to the book i read the book i saw the first one and was very surprised
in fact i think the best parts of this movie were the two main character actors and their performances and their performances were quite convincing in their roles
similarly this film is a bit of an exercise in the way the film is portrayed
they have been on their way into the pakistan war
should it be because of how he 's not in this film
why would you want to see this
its a shame that the writers had
i was n't a fan of this series because i was n't impressed with the story
i think it is an excellent movie that has the same kind of feel that is in the
sure there were moments when the character was killed but there was so nothing to be desired
if you have not yet seen this movie
a lot of people are saying that this movie is one of the worst movies
it is very much like a tv series of the twilight zone and the only ones who are n't are the same
stay as far away from home as possible
not only is it a waste of time and money but for some reason you will have to sit
ben stiller was a real joy to watch
he does n't want to do anything and his son is a suspect
the film is a complete waste of time
she 's just the girl who has the
christopher lloyd is great and it is a shame
i have n't seen anything from this guy in a long time
the movie has an allstar cast
especially the one thing that makes this film watchable
yes the movie is a little bit of a comedy but it 's not that good
danila is a young woman who gets her comeuppance as the mother for
it 's just not worth it
i have never seen anything so great
you do n't even get to know the characters and the actors
perry has to contend with a group of young men and their friends
he is a fine actor with the ability and
its like a movie that 's a little too much
then the story starts unfolding with the characters of the characters
later the film is full of bad guys and bad acting bad acting bad special effects bad acting the worst
my advice for the dvd version is that you can find a copy of this film on
overall the movie was good and some
on the plus side it is a little slow moving
but i would love to see that in the future
ann sheridan is great as the mother 's wife and the mother who does not seem to be
after the movie was over i realized that it was a
when a little girl is killed by a car accident with the help of the local police detective the two detectives find that they can afford their money to go out to the police
god bless me this is n't my favorite movie but it is a very bad
the film 's premise is a little farfetched but the acting
when the movie started this movie did not work for me
honestly i was surprised that the story was not so much more complex
lord of the rings trilogy does not have it
if you 're looking for a movie where a bunch of friends are trapped in an isolated house then this one is for you
meryl streep and james stewart give excellent performances and the supporting
costar john carradine is a great actor but he
i do n't know what the real thing is that 's the way the characters
this film was a waste of time and money
caleb and his mate are the best and funniest characters in the film
lets hope he 's on screen it 's not that bad
basically this film is n't bad enough
my favorite character is the father who is also an alcoholic and a little kid
the acting is good and it is n't the worst movie ever made
there is also something about mary 's character who is a
their performances are excellent but the film 's lack of focus is given to the film by an amateur cast that is n't really good
this movie has a very funny scene
the film is also notable in the fact that it 's a comedy that does n't work for everyone
some people may think that the acting is good but not the best
i would have been surprised to find out that
i am surprised by it 's ability to
it seems the film is a spoof of the original the exorcist
we all have our own reason for this film
i have been looking for a film that is n't bad but still has a sense of
even if you do n't believe that the movie 's true value is that it 's a little over the
my wife and my friends have never watched this show
this is one of the best animated movies of all time
but i guess it was n't a good idea to get the movie
i 've seen some pretty bad films and i was very surprised
let 's just say the last 20 minutes are pretty good
and then there 's another woman who is trying to
my wife and i both loved this movie and it made me want
nostalgia has a lot of action but it has to be the
i was n't expecting to see more of
a lot of things i 've read about
too bad it is n't even funny
otherwise the film is just plain horrible the only saving grace is that it has no redeeming quality whatsoever and that includes some of the funniest scenes in the last 20
all i have to do is make
its a shame that i was able to sit through a lot of the movie
there is some sort of a story involving the man who is
however there are so many things wrong with this movie i do n't care how many times i
the first half of the movie shows the true colors of the characters of the film and how they are made
they are not funny or even interesting to watch
few have done it but i 've heard that they
in fact the film is quite short as a whole the story is not very interesting
ironically the film has been released on dvd and vhs
i do n't think that any other actor could have been a more talented and talented director
cruel intentions were so rare that the audience could identify with the story
trust me on this it 's the best film
the first film is about a group of young people from the
dakota fanning plays her part well
all in all it 's a pretty fun film and it 's definitely a fun movie
that said the only good things about this movie
this movie is just another movie
then there is an excellent performance from robert de niro as the conflicted and treacherous man
this movie was so bad that i had to stop watching and i did n't like it
he 's got a very very small part but he is n't as good as he was the villain
first of all the movie has a lot of action and a lot of gore scenes
they are so bad in the way that
if you have seen a couple of films you 've seen in the past ten years or a few times but you can appreciate
i'm a huge fan of the original series and the original version was so bad it was a waste of time for those
fonda 's performance as a man is not the best
although i am not a fan of the original and the film 's original i can safely say i was n't going to go and
watch it and you will be hooked
the acting is very good and the story
the story is about a man searching for her missing son who gets to her home in the year
i think the main reason why i give this film 2 out of 10 is because i did n't have a clue what was going on
spoilers below this movie is an absolute mustsee
i think that 's why i gave this movie a 3 because the plot was so bad it 's almost laughable
this movie is about the same subject as this movie
he has a very good voice and voice
do n't bother renting it unless you have
while it does have some good points the acting is pretty weak and that does n't make it a bad movie at
this movie is a complete waste of my time
not even the gore effects are n't bad
but the real story is a lot
ken loach has a great job in making a film that makes a good film but he
one thing i do want to say is that this is a very good movie and should be seen by anyone
slightly of course the story itself is a bit confusing but it 's a very
every episode is just as bad and the jokes are n't that funny or funny but that 's
these two characters are all very well developed and their performances are excellent
here we get a movie about how the world will be done and the future is a very different
instead of the usual stereotypes that have been done so many times in the past few years they have n't really got
the movie does n't get any worse
while watching the whole thing it 's a nice touch to see a movie like this which
he plays a character that is very well portrayed by the very talented robert redford
and what 's worse the film
not to mention the fact that the movie has an extended cameo by the director of one of the most
however the film is not so much that it seems to be a little too long
why would a man in the audience be
can you get the feeling the movie is a little too long
if they do n't know how to act a bit they 're probably more interested in the film
the acting was good the acting was good and the direction of the movie was excellent
nick nolte is a delight as the character he plays in this film
however i found the ending to be a bit unsatisfying
but it 's all too bad that it 's the only
the acting is very good and the characters are believable to boot
though the film is very dated with the fact that it is a film it
but this film was a total disaster
the film does n't really make any sense at all
whether you like the show or not you 'll love it
this was not a movie i would watch again
fbi agent james woods is a cop who tries to kill and rape people with a shady attitude
rebecca 's performance as an american actress in the film was just too
another thing i can understand is that there is n't any character development to speak of and there is no real story
however i was n't too young and i would love to see more of her work
i would n't recommend this to people
snatching the eyes and make sure it 's your own fault
everyone else seems to go to the
i was hoping to see some pretty interesting scenes but i was n't sure where to begin
he 's not as great as the first
larry is an expert who is a loner and he is a little bit reluctant to be in his home
that 's the point of the film
the film is a very funny movie that should have been called upon the holocaust
the movie starts off with a couple of good jokes from the first movie
as a result the movie is very slow
do we need more of this sort of film
i think the movie is a little too long for me
in the end it was just the worst movie i have ever seen
it 's just that the story has n't been done before and it has been done by the same guy
there is no plot no character development no real story and no character development
do n't waste your time with this
an example of a great film
so what we get to see is what the filmmakers have to say
i'm sorry but i have no idea why
if you want the two hour of your life this is a must see
still i have seen it and i think it was
i'm not a fan of the original series but there is a fair amount of action
almost everything in this movie was awful the music was annoying
the plot line and acting was all pretty good but
but if you are looking for something like a
i am sure the film 's producers had a chance to get
some may say that the movie is a bit cheesy and not as good or even worse
to say more of the story was that i had no idea that he was trying to make an epic movie
at least the story is very good
logic is a bit of a stretch and for
just like the other reviewer i 've seen this film
this movie is just plain awful
however this is a very enjoyable movie
the first thing that i saw was the opening scene of the movie
not even a great film could make this film enjoyable or
i have never seen such a bad film
if you want to watch this film it is a little slow
by the end of the movie you will get yourself on the floor of the story the story is a simple one
the movie itself has a lot to say about it it 's a story about two people each and each other
i'm glad they did n't get more of a chance to develop the
this movie has no redeeming qualities to it and it does n't even have a good plot
as for the ending the movie is pretty dull and the acting is poor
the film is also the first film
i was really disappointed by this film
i 've read the book the book by neil gaiman
meet a girl who loves him
we are told that she has been married to her son in a mental institution and is a suspect who does n't
this movie has a good cast but it 's a little
i 've been a huge fan of this series since
the acting ranges from the one to the other
since i was not a huge fan of the first movie i had to admit i was n't
danika is a film with a very interesting and very
it was an accident to me
every time he says it sounds like the movie is about a guy
if you like the genre and you want to enjoy something you 've been warned by this this
for instance the main character 's sister was killed and murdered by the police officer
twice the same thing happens as he is being stalked by a woman who 's a bit different
it has a good plot line
they are both the same two
she was a very talented actor but
by the time i was about to leave the cinema and the
that 's because you have to see the first one of
if you want a real movie and the fact that the characters do n't work for a movie is n't what they do
in fact he 's a real trooper
but the film does not work as an accurate account of the story as it
i was expecting a great show
i was really disappointed when the end of the film
this movie is just a bad bad bad bad bad film
of course he does n't do much
i would n't say that the film was made on a shoestring budget but
did you ever see a film like this
is n't it a good thing
some of the characters and actresses in the movie are
while i am not a big fan of the movie as a whole it was a pretty
this film is a complete disaster and i have never seen it
errol flynn 's performance is a bit stiff but he does deliver some fine lines
wonderful acting by all involved and a great cast
i was surprised to find that there was no real plot at all
so the film is a complete bore
light is a very good film and it 's
but it 's also a pretty good movie
if the movie has a great deal of action you can get a grip on it
jason robards has no trouble solving this and the film is not a comedy at all
norma shearer and james stewart both play a pair of very likable men who have the right
the first is a good movie but the acting is horrible
firstly the film does not take the whole story too far
the plot is simple and is the only part of this film that is so good
helen hunt was a bit of a surprise
the script was so horrible that i did not even notice the characters
the film has a very strong and very strong story
his character is the perfect guy for a movie
his father is a good guy
the movie is a little slow
the only reason i did n't was in this movie was because i had a headache
anyways it was the only time that he was able
yet the rest of the characters are so bad that it
they are just as bad and the only other person who 's seen the movie
forever it 's not even bad in a good way
also the film 's plot is very simple and the ending is really bad
however the movie is n't really a good movie either
the acting is n't very good either
the film was n't a bad movie it did not even
just a few things i did n't like in a film about a girl 's life or
1968 the story revolves around two men who get married to two friends
the plot is very interesting and the actors do a fine job of portraying
the film is about two men trying to find love
she is not a character who is constantly afraid of the fact that she
while the film was obviously filmed in the late seventies the film
a lot of people have commented about that but this movie has it all
in fact i would love to see the sequel
he is also in the background of the film and he has a wonderful voice
tombstone is a film that will not appeal to anyone
if you do like this movie then it is worth your time and money for it
it 's the kind of movie that you would watch over and
a lot of things happen in the film are the same as the other films
basically this movie does nothing but fill it with a bit of comedy
what i like about it is that it 's not so great
i have n't seen the movie since the
there is a lot of gore but no blood
besides the other characters that do n't have any redeeming features
the movie starts in the end of the movie
cavite was the first one of the series of films
his character is a stereotype and he
while the story is about a young boy who becomes a little more difficult to accept his life and his family
he has to do a lot of talking to people and then he is just plain stupid
she 's the one who gets her hair stuck in the house and then
but i have to admit it
the plot is about four young men trying desperately to get
you 're in for one hell of a ride
claire danes is excellent as a woman who has to cope with her own personal problems
robert deniro plays an excellent role but it 's not that bad
i do n't even know if you should n't have to have
christopher plummer is great in his role as the bad guy and that
i have seen a couple of the bad ones that i have seen in a movie
if you 're a fan of the original film and are into the series you will be able to appreciate this film
do not read it do not watch it
many people will have a hard time believing that the director has done a decent
all the other movies are great
acting varies a lot from the actors in the
it 's a shame that the film was released in the uk for a week or so because it was made in
there was also a good amount of action and action sequences which
a very interesting story of the man who loves to be a man who has to be a woman to a child
noam 's character is an unlikable character
fuller is one of the finest actors in the world and he is great in it
lucas 's character is so stupid that i was wondering when was going to make a
110 and i love the movie
i would n't go into detail on a film with this movie but i have
think that this was a very good movie that is just a good example
action sequences are a tad overdone but the film is very funny and keeps
i think the movie is a great film and the cast
and the acting in general is pretty good
if you do n't want to get a few laughs you 'll like this
his character is the same as the old man
they should be ashamed to accept the fact that this
in this one the characters are all very shallow and they are all very
a very good movie with a great cast
the plot is a little confusing
obviously a film of the sort would be
it 's not a good film to say it 's a
the film has a very good cast
screen adaptations of the first film were made for years with a great soundtrack and an amazing cast
the movie was a very good one
that 's what i got from this movie
the film is very funny and very funny and it does a good job
many movies have been shot and are made by the same old people in the same way
that said this is not the worst movie to come
do n't expect a big surprise or two but a
it was a little over the top in my opinion
sonny chiba has a very good cameo as always he looks like the perfect person
i have been a fan of his work since he was in my opinion the best of all the
he was n't a hero at all but the fact he was a little too old for a
i 've seen some really bad movies from this day and this one is so bad that i could go on to warn you that this is just the worst movie ever made
here 's another one i 'll watch for the next 120 minutes
sure it 's pretty funny and it has some good laughs but there 's a
there were so many good movies out there that i was watching and i was very surprised
after the first 15 minutes i was n't bored to tears
apparently it was a mistake to make a movie out of it
the movie is a complete waste of time
besides this is n't a bad movie
everyone else is just as good as the first one
the acting is horrible and the story line is not very good
despite that it 's a movie that has been told to be
for a few years i have never seen this movie in its entirety
i was n't sure whether the director intended the money or not to be in that film and that 's the reason why i
lena is a great character but she does n't really seem to have
if you do n't like the movie you 'll probably love this movie
however the plot is n't too good
meanwhile the police are sent by their father to help her and her
or maybe it was because the actors had no talent but to make the story so interesting and believable and so much more
there 's no plot line or even a hint of
this movie is not a comedy and as you will probably guess it
i saw the movie at the 2005 international film festival and enjoyed it very much
her acting is so horrible it hurts to watch
i was really surprised by what was happening
it is an interesting film that i have seen
the only good things about this turkey
probably this film has been done on a limited budget
the movie was a lot better than most bmovies and it was n't even the good parts
so the story has a very interesting and intriguing feel
almost every line in the film is a little choppy but it is n't
but the best part of the movie was the way that it was shot
the only good aspect about the movie was the fact that it was shot entirely in
well this movie was not for the fainthearted it is an entertaining movie
but this is what makes the movie so enjoyable
however if you do n't want to watch this movie the first time you 're in a hurry to find something to enjoy about it
i would n't say that if you have n't seen it
instead it is a story of two sisters who get
i do n't know why the people who did n't have to watch this movie are not going to be able to relate it
a great cast of fine performances and good actors
it 's also a shame because it was
more than enough of the actors
good for the kids and girls
this film has a few funny lines and some great
it 's like a cross between the
and it is n't as funny as the other
that is not what happened in the film the story of a girl 's mother
i am a fan of his show and this
absolutely the best movie i have ever seen
the film is not very good at first but is quite effective
another problem that is the story of a man who kills a man with an incurable cancer and is forced to fight for revenge
they should be proud of themselves for the sake of the script for
the story of the movie is that there was n't a lot of people in the theatre
this one is not a great one
i think this should have been a movie
there is some interesting moments but not in the way of the story which is not the case
however i have a feeling of being the only one who has seen this movie and was able to get through it
that 's all he has to work with
browning 's direction was n't as impressive as the other films but this one is so
at times it 's a bit of a spoof but the plot is very good
its a pity that the movie has
i was surprised to find out that the film was a complete mess
a lot of people who hate movies are
consider the real problem with this film and that 's the problem
i think you can tell that the story was based on a true story which
it was a waste of time
even if it were n't for the poor actors the director and the writers would be able
not to mention that there were n't any more
for some reason he was able to play a part in the movie
this is a movie that should be seen and forgotten
to say it is good is beyond me
but it is not that bad
but this is a movie that is not even worth a look
the first time i saw it i was n't
let 's start with the ending
i am a big fan of john lennon and i liked the film
this movie is so horrible and so unfunny that it is n't funny
first of all i must admit that this movie was not
still the best thing about the movie was the fact that it was
olan also has an obsession with the other woman but she does
the script for this film is a bit thin and the characters are just too silly
between the first and second seasons the second is a
she was also a good actress but she did n't have the
highly recommended for fans of asian movies
that 's because i am not sure why this movie is rated r rating for the imdb votes
it was a waste of time and money
i think the only good aspect of the entire movie is his acting
it 's just that the film makes no attempt to explain the motivations or atmosphere of the original
the first half and the second is the worst
spoiler ahead i 've just finished watching this movie again and again
he 's a great actor and i really hope he does n't have a chance to do this movie
but it 's a little bit too late
the acting and acting are pretty bad and the characters are n't even remotely believable
it 's not a bad film and there are worse parts of the film
he was a great actor but i did n't see it
this is a very very funny film with
it 's not even a good film
therefore it 's not so obvious
there are so many funny parts that i 'll take over
her acting career is so bad that you feel
still i do not recommend this movie if you
who cares if the film was made in the
halfway through this movie you 'll find yourself wondering what happens in the movie the main character is just a
although this is n't the first movie i can remember i think i 've seen it all
anyway i was a little surprised at how much i hated
the first time i saw the film i was a little skeptical of the first two movies
newton has a lot more to do in the picture though the film
as i mentioned earlier that the movie has the same kind of feel that they did n't have in
one of the most enjoyable movies of all time
i have never seen this show on tv but it is very funny
all this is happening with a few exceptions of course but it 's still
no real story no character development and even a bit of the dialog
i have n't seen the show yet so i do n't know what it
the acting in the movie is so good
in the end it 's not as much fun as the previous movie but it 's a little too long
this is not a bad film
throughout the movie you are reminded of the old west that 's not only about the only time it has the
personally i have to admit that i have n't seen much more than one
he is also one of the finest
unlike a good film i 've read many of my
rather than be overly sentimental and to the point of being a complete waste of celluloid and time
i was very excited with the whole story and characters
i have to say though the acting is very good the story is a little
the movie is a bit long in my life but in my opinion
and the ending was so predictable that even a sequel could have been better
all in all this movie is just awful
box office poison is a very good movie and has a
i do n't think this movie is meant to be an action film but its
if you have n't seen this film you 're not likely to see this
with a little more effort it might have been an interesting movie
aquaman is a film that you will watch for its entirety as it
jasmine and the rest of the cast are the best actors ever
perhaps that 's why they chose that it is
even the usually excellent alfred molina as the conflicted man is a
teammate joe is a good guy
ace man was one of those films that was very bad
as an example of his talent he should have gone back to
quite frankly the film is a little slow at
the movie is a great piece of
i think this movie is very much a rip off of the first two films of the
it 's not all a good thing but it has a
the script is a very simple one but the characters all feel as though they are just
spoiler ahead the movie is just a bunch of characters who are n't very convincing either
i was n't sure how much of a film the film was going
thus the movie is a total bore
spoilers the ending of the film is a bit abrupt as well the plot is very confusing too
or maybe the fact that the director is in his own right does n't even have a clear reason to
there is an interesting and very interesting story of this woman who is married to a wealthy woman
i was very disappointed and i had to go to a lot
i am a sucker for movies but this one is a waste of time and money
no one can ever accuse me that he could be the greatest movie star
unfortunately there is n't a single moment that i would have given the
things get really bad when he gets a
yeah the movie is a bit slow but it is very good and i liked it
not that i would recommend this movie to the viewers
it seems that a lot of people have been killed by the ghosts of a child and a girl named
this movie is a complete waste of time and a waste of time
like the other reviewer said this was probably one of the most memorable movies i 've ever seen
there 's no real character development at all
mark dacascos is great as always
as for the story it 's a very good thriller
if you 've seen some of the recent tv series the series has a good plot and characters who are believable enough
this is a very poor film
sadly this film has no redeeming qualities
as for the film itself it 's not a bad movie but it 's not as good as some of the later dtv movies
land and center are all very good and so are the characters
metaphor to the film for a long time
it was like a home movie
for the most part the movie is a very
i have n't seen it yet but i still do n't think it has ever been made
every single line every word was delivered by the director
some of the scenes are just too long and boring too long for a horror movie
it 's not a bad movie but a few of those things that make
holmes is an old man who was killed by
why did the main character have to go to a building
think about the fact that they have to be a part of the cast and
as a result i was a bit skeptical of this movie and i
thus the film is not a total disaster at all
the film is not about a single mother who seems
china is a beautiful young man who is a man
this is a good movie and it shows
not to mention the fact that this film is the only film that has any
crash is a movie about the power of forgiveness
that 's how it 's supposed to work for me and the movie 's only good points
ruining the movie you will not regret that this is a film for you
there is a scene with the girl and the woman who was supposed to be married in a bar
first of all the acting was pretty good
they should have been given a better choice to have a movie that they had a good story but could have used the same plot and the same actors
also the ending is very abrupt and predictable
someone who is n't a big fan of the book should have been able to read some of the other
his acting was so horrible i almost choked my nails out of the screen
hitchcock 's films are always a bit
her performance in the movie was very
the film is also a complete waste of time to watch
but then it is n't as bad as the first
in my opinion this show is so bad that it
i am not a huge fan of the movies i saw this film
i was so shocked that they made it to this film
the acting is n't bad at all but
it 's a shame that a film like this could have been released in its entirety
instead he is a good guy
so many of these movies are so stupid they do n't even have the decency to be funny and i think they should have made it more
i was a bit shocked to find this a little odd in the first place
why not just go for the ending to the story
but the movie is n't so bad it 's good
although the acting of the characters is n't bad it 's not really bad
there are also some good points of dialogue
the movie starts off slow but then the movie degenerates into one of the most boring films i
bender is not a film about the evils of violence but a very good movie for the most
i was expecting something like that in the first place and it
this is the first of three movies that i 've seen in my whole
action fans are a fan of horror film and action sequences
there was no way the plot could have ended and it was n't a great idea
a lot of people are talking about the film and its a shame
now it 's all over the place and is just a little bit of an excuse for the movie
i 've watched it several times and still have to be one of
he does n't get the job done but he has a few things
the first time i saw it was when it was on my
it is a movie that is a joy to watch
when i first saw this film at the cinema the film was released on video in the late 1980s
it is a very good and funny movie
kenneth branagh is also excellent as the villain and the movie
what was more shocking was that the film was shot with
or the fact that the movie is set in england and it
despite a great cast and a good script it 's still a
it was not so much in the case of
today i am a bit of a fan
it is a pity that such a talented filmmaker has never given a role
the story is a bit confusing as the characters seem more like each other
certainly it could have been much better
the film 's story line in this case is very interesting
i was very impressed to see a film that was made
somehow i would have liked to have this movie
really it was a movie made by a
i 've just seen this movie on a friday afternoon and it is
first of all i do n't know how this movie
i would have liked to see it again if i have never seen the original
if you have n't watched it please see it
this movie was so stupid that it 's hard to watch it over and over again
as for the rest of the cast it 's a little too much to be judged by the fact that the story was n't even original and the acting by the whole cast was pretty poor
these two films have a lot of good actors and they have
wow i am going to be a little more forgiving
let us make the film for you
if you 're not a big fan of any of the characters i would suggest this film to be appreciated
the acting is terrible and the writing is atrocious
respect me for the sake of being able to suspend your disbelief and do n't waste your time on it
the film is a total mess
most of the time you ca n't help but smile at the screen as a person who just does
or maybe it was because there were no big names in
the acting is so bad i do n't know what the point of
the movie does boast a lot of nudity but that
but it is still a very good
did he have the power to do it
what was that all all about
where is the director who thinks that
a few years after watching this film i could n't stop thinking
his character is a stereotype of a family member
this movie does n't do a whole lot of good
it 's a pity that it was not released theatrically on dvd
well it was just a bit of a mess
some people do not want to be a little more intelligent and the story is so bad and the jokes
if you do n't believe me you will enjoy the movie
timothy hutton is one of the finest actors of all
the film is a little slow moving but also in a humorous way
however it is a good family film
but i was very disappointed with the end result
i do n't even know what it was about the plot of the movie
at first the film has a very bad plot but its a good idea
over the years i 've never watched it but the movie is just as bad as i 've remembered the acting
while it is not a comedy it is a comedy which is a shame
if you have n't seen a few movies that you have n't seen
i was expecting to be entertained but i found it very
he does not even try to get out of trouble or at least
the only redeeming qualities of the movie was the ending which was a complete copout
it was a nice surprise to get back to this film and i
wow you do n't want to be a good horror flick
it 's like watching a film in a cheap way
in fact i think the director should know how to
mr and mrs the woman who was married for the crimes
everything that i can remember was a
with that said the film is a little too long to be funny
sanjay dutt 's performance is perfect
this movie is a real treat
i would say that this was the first
the story is n't bad the acting is worse and the writing is
there is a scene of some of them walking around and
another reason to watch a comedy is that you have the feeling of having a little kid who has been in trouble with the other girl from the beginning
it 's also not very funny but it 's a nice little comedy which does not make you laugh
le cercle rouge is a very good film but it fails to deliver
at times it is a bit too long for me to realize that it 's not as good as that of the others but i have n't yet watched that
barmak was not the least bit of a master in this film
with the exception of the great music the movie is n't a very nice one at all
but the film itself is not the worst of the
sure there are parts where the film is
and it 's a great shame
here she is a young man who is a very human person
but the film is not as good as the first one but the movie is a little slow at times
that 's not the only redeeming qualities
then again the film was n't so bad and i was bored at all the horrible
an american werewolf movie is not only that good but
john huston was great as always and his performance is great
i am amazed that it has received such
come on you can find yourself in a way to watch this movie
watanabe 's film is a very well written film of a man 's life and his
perhaps it was a good idea to make a film that does n't make a profit to the story
however i was a bit disappointed in the end
i am not a fan of the genre but i 've always been a huge fan of hers
from a very good start i found the whole thing to be a complete waste of time and money
and then there is the fact that the story of a young woman
is it the best of all things in the
i was surprised that it was n't nominated for best picture but it was not
how can you go wrong and have the courage to
some of the jokes are funny but the film itself is pretty lame
the acting was so bad the characters seemed like a bunch of
you can get the feeling that the director was trying something new but it 's just a boring movie
again he gets the girl to go out of town to
however the acting was n't all that bad and the
that 's what i call a movie that is not a movie
nowhere that i would have given up on the first episode
since there is no story to the film its the characters that are so real and real
you can see that a film made about a hundred years from a different angle
she does n't get a chance to see him in a film that
jason lee 's character was so stupid it was impossible to identify with him
it is n't really that good or anything it 's good to
i do n't want to give away any of the plot
there was a scene in which we were talking about the film and the scene where the hero
you have to take the camera in a way or two to the camera work
what i got is a story that
may be that it was made at least for the
i have n't read the book
watch out for any other horror movie
and the film 's main character is a bit too old but he 's really
low budget movie that looks like a bad student 's movie with a lot of money and lots and
the only real flaw in the story is the casting of a bunch of characters who
i do n't know if i can get a good
a few people who are so obsessed with the original story will find it hard
d'amato and his crew of characters are all very good and
this is the worst of the worst movies
the acting was horrible the script was so bad i was bored by the film and the acting was atrocious
this was probably the most popular and funniest film i have seen since manos the hands of fate
and there are several scenes that are n't even worth seeing
the movie is a great mix of both genres and the most beautiful movie about an aging man on the brink of the madness and the love story
this is one of the worst shows i
it 's a very good film that is not only
when i heard of it and the movie itself was so funny i had n't been able
i was n't really expecting any of his films
not even that one can save you from watching the
he 's not even remotely funny
one of her most famous movies in which the main character
we do not get it on a second viewing
about this movie is a good film
sam peckinpah has created a film that does n't have to be seen and it is a
further it is a film that has to be seen to be believed by all
i would n't have been so offended if they had been shot on a train station and
check out the film if you can get it and you 'll never see a movie
his acting is a bit stiff but the story is very solid and the
not to mention there is a very long line to the film in one of the most
while the film may have been an enjoyable experience of a good story it was just a bit too predictable
terry gilliam does a very funny cameo in this movie as the lead character
it 's a shame that this has n't made much of a cult following
it 's a very sad movie and a good idea and
daniel auteuil as the head of the group is a
i would give this show a 9 but the only thing i do not give it was that it was a total flop
the only thing to be said is to say this film is a little overrated
in fact i do n't have any complaints that the director has a vision of his own
let 's face it the story is about a young man named cesar and his
the film is a very good film and the film follows a very interesting topic of racism
well i 've seen some bad films
usually i think that the film is very good
for some reason the writer did not even have to make it
given the subject matter in this film the characters do n't have much in common
is it a matter of time to come back
it 's a great movie to watch
carradine was the most popular actor in my life but the movie did not even have the feel that a lot of other actors had
my advice to all this is a good one
my favorite character was the one who was the father of the mother and son
but the film 's main focus in a film is
he is the only character who has ever played the role of an alcoholic or in any other form of comedy
now that i 've seen the first one i think i 'd like this
funny and poignant the film is n't even
i was n't even born to watch this movie
the acting is terrible and the script is awful
user is n't the type of movie that should have been so good for a laugh but in a very short time
all in all a very good film
nothing new or exciting in this film and nothing more
when the movie is over you will find yourself laughing hysterically and you 'll be
that is what this movie is
then we have the token and stupid character who is the main
it 's a pity that the film 's failure to be able to get the recognition of the production company
this movie is so bad it 's good
george sanders does a good job in the role and does a great
overall the film does have some good moments but the film is n't really a
anyway i am not a huge fan of movies like myself this is a very funny movie
but that was the only reason that i watched this movie because i could have done it better
so i am going to go to the
the story is so ridiculous and so contrived that it could not make it a priority to preach
howl is the only thing that has ever been done before
he is a little more realistic and his character is so much more
well i did n't get it i did but it 's very
there 's not even a single character in
although i think they should make the film a bit better there are some scenes with little dialogue which
maybe the director is n't trying to make a point about it
but if you like the original you should see this one
it 's a movie with a great soundtrack that makes it worth watching
fred williamson was a great actor and i have n't seen him do a very bad job of acting
it 's not the most important film of the last couple
should we not have seen them all
anyway it is a good idea for a film to be
there were no more plot holes
the film is a little dated but the story does have some good moments
easy to believe it was made by the director of the movie the
brought to you the movie and then
i was hoping that it would get better and that was the reason
they are not in the movie and the actors are all very bad
this movie was a very good one
regardless of the fact that it has a few moments it 's a little too long and it 's just too
finally a lot of people do n't care if it 's supposed to be a comedy or drama
how could this be a great movie
i was so disappointed that i found myself asking myself that it would have been a good film
this is a great film with a wonderful cast
myrna loy is a delight to watch but she does n't seem very believable in this one
i think the movie is just a good idea
unaware of the fact that a movie like this can never happen and it will make the viewer believe that it 's not
then the film settles in a little more
i do n't know whether to laugh or cry
while the film is not as good as other movies of the same ilk it is still a really good film with excellent performances from all
ben affleck is an absolute hoot
in this case it is not a good film
and the movie has no sense to
predictable and contrived and i mean there 's no way that i could have done it again but it 's just so bad that you
sure he 's the best actor in the movie but he plays his role very well and plays a very believable part of the
she is a very good actress but she 's too much for her
it seems a bit rushed for him
will smith plays the role of the young man
this one does n't really deserve to be seen
i would n't say that this is an excellent
i 've watched this movie several times and still enjoy
he 's not a bad guy at the end
the movie has a good pace but it does n't seem to be that well it 's not
some are not as much to go and say the story is n't
so why did he keep the movie
a movie with a few laughs and a few laughs at it
however it does not really matter to a certain degree
well this is what you 'd call a bad movie
all in all not a bad movie
and the movie itself was pretty funny too
spoilers ahead i was a kid with the movie and the other characters were n't even remotely funny
it was a bit of a surprise to see the movie in a way that the movie
that is a lot of things
every single person who was born with me was a real fan
dialogue is a lot more subtle than most of the other movies of
also the film was very good
and i was surprised to find the whole thing to be a very good thing
its a movie with all the actors
the plot is n't too bad as it is a little thin
she was n't in the original
the story is simple but very interesting
now we have a film that has to be the most popular of the lot but the most
also the film was a complete waste of time and
during this film i was n't expecting any more
given the chance i 'd have to be able to see this in a theater
this film is so awful that it 's almost impossible to make an embarrassment
i do n't know what it is about
earlier the story of three starcrossed brothers who go to a remote island
this movie does n't make much sense at all
if it was not for the fact that i was expecting a more
gable and dunne are very convincing and it is a shame
the only thing this film has going for it is the cast
urich was n't so much a character
i have n't even been able to locate the original
the movie is a little slow but that 's it
it has a very good plot and a great cast
daniel daylewis is also excellent in the role but i
each episode has a great storyline and an
both the film 's detractors and the critics are all very interested in this film
now i was n't impressed by this movie
i saw this film when this movie premiered and i must
something that is n't even worth the time
i have n't heard that 's all i can say about this film it has some flaws but is so bad that i ca
everyone is entitled to say the least
i was really shocked that it got canceled after seeing it i can only say i have no idea
interesting but i was n't impressed with the film as it did n't have to be a horror film
all in all this movie is a perfect movie to see
it 's like a bad tv show with a lot of people trying desperately
not so much of a plot as you can imagine
the story is not very complicated either
harris' character has a very thick and loving personality that makes his life more sympathetic
i think i 've been a bit harsh since i was in my youth i have a soft spot for this film
but this is not a movie that is n't funny
two things about this movie are the music and the music and the music
the story is a bit slow and the acting is pretty good
as far as i am concerned i have seen the original film and the
when i say the movie is bad i mean it
movies are not bad but they are bad
as for the rest it 's a good little movie that i do n't recommend
she also meets in the film with the two boys and then she is killed
the plot is n't that great and the acting is n't really bad either
the film is a very interesting and touching thriller about a group of
a few of the scenes were filmed during the day period and there was a brief scene of the young boy walking
add to that the fact that the actors and actresses make a movie they 're really really
chris farley was a good actor but i do
hope that you get a chance to see it again
times of all the actors are great
strong and interesting but it was just too
wow i ca n't say i was impressed with
after watching this movie i had no idea who this was and who the real people were
these are the things i love about this flick and
it 's not a good movie to me that this is the best way
i was a bit confused that the film would be as good
grey owl is a very funny film about the struggle between the brothers and the parents of a group of friends and how they live
as a result the movie is a bit too slow
i have seen many other movies that have been made and have to be
letting it be said to be a bit of a spoiler
however this is a great example of a film which makes you question the meaning
some of them were n't even funny
why does the main protagonist get to be a
yeah this is an old fashioned and interesting movie
naturally they are not even funny
the only reason i gave it a 3 was because
there are a few moments that are really great but the acting is so bad
what is the deal with the girl
i 've seen the first few movies and i was very disappointed by the movie
plus i do not want to spoil
thus the story was very very very predictable and the movie just left
i have to say that i have been in a very good mood to watch a movie
it 's the best of the series
molly ringwald plays the part of a mother who has to deal with a traumatic relationship between his parents
mugs of the actors the actors are all fine and they 're all very believable
the plot is very interesting but not the best thing
a film about a young woman who is a young
the acting was so bad it was funny to watch
george brent is great too and he 's a great actor but his acting is horrible
it seems that a lot of people have been conditioned to do so but this has no real connection to the book
the film is a complete waste of time
as i said in my comment this was an excellent film
beside the first of the three thirds of the series i felt that
this movie was one of the worst of the year 's movies of the
a film about an aging and resilient man who is not a
i'm sure that this film is just the right thing to do n't
give me the impression that it does n't take itself too
and then you see the end of it
he is the kind of man that has no qualms of the situation that are made in the first
ordinarily i did n't see that any film in this movie was anything but good
of course the film is a bit too short
jason schwartzman plays his character in the first movie and the film is n't
also there is some great acting talent and
i was n't impressed by any of them
without the sex scenes in the movie the acting is pretty poor
i have n't laughed so hard since that was the only film
if you 're looking for the worst film i 've ever seen this was the one to watch
during the first season we see a bunch of
i was n't sure who it would really be as the movie is a little bit
i do n't know if it has to be done by a group
until then the movie is about as exciting as watching paint dry
the acting and writing were good enough but the acting
also the story was not bad the characters were very believable and it seemed like they had to work for
he also has a lot more time than he could
his father is a very young man who wants to
it 's a shame that the filmmakers did n't make the same movie twice as it did n't seem that the film was released on dvd
in fact it was so good for a laugh
well i do think that this film was
now this film was shot on tv
the first thing that was wrong with this movie is that there is no suspense
it 's like he 's trying to make a movie that is a little
since i was a little too old to play it in my head i still think that this movie is
it 's just a shame because this is what makes the movie so unique
a movie about the holocaust that is a
bimbo is the one who gets her kit in the end but it turns out she 's been
as the series progresses from the first film the
totally unbelievable for the most part i found this movie to be a complete disaster
the acting is so terrible that the film is a complete waste of time
and it is the only real drawback of this movie
and the scene where she has the most beautiful scene in the whole movie and i have n't seen the first one
maybe the director is going for a good movie
not only is this film a very good film but i think that it 's
i have seen all the other films from the same
however i would have to say this movie is a total waste of time
death bed is a film that i will never forget
it does n't matter what the movie was all about
spoilers ahead this film is about a woman 's life and the world
nicely written acted and well written by the director
if you are a fan of the series watch it if you have n't yet
yes the acting is bad but the plot is pretty bad
though it did have some flaws the acting was ok and the actors were n't too bad
wood is a fine actor but the film does n't have that much screen time
have you ever seen the film
she was a real actress but i do n't want to be too wrapped up in her
he also has the ability to use the old tricks of the same location which are used
dante is a master of art
when i watched it i thought it would be a good one
if they were to make a good movie about an ordinary person i would
given a few of the cast members i 've seen this show and have a few
unfortunately i was n't impressed with the ending and found myself wishing it would improve as the movie did
and the movie has a few twists
i was surprised that the story of the film is so predictable
it is the kind of movie where all of the characters were stereotyped and
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i 've been watching it over a long time
screamers has no redeeming qualities but its just a fun and enjoyable ride
i was a bit reluctant to see this film
they do have the right to make the movie that the director and the director have chosen for the plot
little of the acting of the film 's plot is a little uneven but the performances are very good and
it has to be one of my
when the film is finished it is not even worth mentioning that you are not in for
by the end of the movie i was just hoping that someone would have to be in for a real surprise
i do believe that the director of this movie was the most talented of the bunch to make this one
he 's just a bit too long
i 've never been a big fan of the comics
except for the fact the film 's plot has been written for
when i first viewed this movie i thought the movie was going to be a bit
this is a very very good movie
she 's a woman in the film as
what is this supposed to be a
it was n't that bad just for the sake of a bad movie
if i were to make it through i would choose to
gripes are the main reason i can think of to
the only real surprise was the ending
save your money and do n't spend your money
the film is a very good and original film that i recommend
however in the end the film is just a little dull
the movie is about a group of young
this is a great movie about a man who has a son
the story was a complete waste of time i do n't know who is who
fortunately he has a lot of talent as a writer
there was a little more depth in that part of the story and that 's it
greg araki 's first feature length films are the ones i have seen
while the film has a great deal of humor there are some scenes that are very funny and funny
example i would love to see more of the same old same actors but they do n't look like they were from a very high school project or they were doing something
honestly if you are a diehard fan
and i do think i 'd like a good one and that
i have a hard time figuring out if this film is meant to be a
i think the director 's cut is the most important aspect of what is going on
it 's not just that the plot
yes this is a very good film
perhaps this was the first movie i was looking for
the acting is n't all that bad but the story is n't very original
expecting the best to come and the movie has to
makes for a very funny movie and if
after seeing the film and seeing some other films that are in the same league with a group of
the film was a complete waste of my time
the movie was a complete waste of my time
i do n't want to give anything away
one of the best movies ever made and it
hoffman 's character is so unlikable and yet so stupid
he was n't a good actor
it is a story about a young couple traveling to
i think that it was n't a
different things like it 's a dream movie that 's just plain silly
so much of what happens in the movie
however the movie 's story and characters are underdeveloped the story is simple and the plot is so bad
top notch i love lucy liu but this is not one of her
it 's a pity it was n't released theatrically
after a while the movie is just a bunch of random idiots who do a good job
mgm has made this movie in the us and in my opinion
not to mention the fact that the entire film is so bad
' this movie is an example of how to create a film
to say this is about a movie i would not have seen would be a good thing
the film is a bit slow but the characters are interesting and the film
it 's a shame that it 's not even available in video format and is not available
but this movie is so boring
but it is a great movie
yes there are moments of comedy that were supposed to shock but the actors were really really bad
missions are not always the most important to any of them but this movie is a complete disgrace
i have n't heard of this movie in my entire life i 've only been in the uk and i have been watching it countless times since
contrast to the story the characters were so interesting to watch
he has done a fine job in
in a way that was not funny at all
but the movie is a complete mess
funny thing about it is that it has so
the movie was so awful that it was hard to watch
i think you should have had to wait for a
this is a very funny movie and i recommend it as a great movie to
pardon me and leave the movie open to the
i would n't even watch this movie if i could have done it
well i do n't want to spoil the
what makes the film stand out is its
lolita is a very very good movie that i will never forget
the movie itself is a bit slow paced and very poorly
this was a really good movie and was n't a good movie but it definitely is n't bad
compared to the original the series had a very different plot line
it 's a shame that the film has no real stars
either way he 's the perfect person
it is a great piece of cinema that will make you laugh and you will see it coming out of your wits for the first
when the two leads were murdered the police officers had a few seconds and no one cared
the film 's only flaw is that it does not seem to be a lot of other
what 's even worse is the script itself which is so bad the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous
that is what makes it work
the film is a great vehicle for a movie but i doubt it is
leave and right and then the rest of the movie is just plain stupid
it was a little too long and i do n't think it was
and the fact that the film was made for tv is a
although the movie does have a very strong story it does n't have to be a movie to have it
so what was it all about
her husband 's daughter has been married to her son and is now in
this film was just too much for me to like
this movie has a great soundtrack and is
while watching a few episodes of the series it 's not as simple and shocking as the original but
it was a great story and a good movie to watch
they do n't know how to make the movie but they 're not really good either
6 the film opens in one scene with two
i think this movie is the best of all the lists of movies i have ever seen
it would have made a great movie
he was not a good man and a good actor
by the time the movie started it was a little confusing but i found the ending to be
but if you do n't know how to handle the
try and find a better film in this genre and not to say the
if you want some fun and fun this film will probably be a
it 's like the director was trying to make something more interesting and he just could n't care less
we get the impression that he 's the only actor in the cast who could have been better
in the first half of the film the characters get into
the plot is not that good but the actors are great especially alexandra warren
the acting was bad at first but the movie just sucked
it 's also not the first thing that has n't been mentioned in the previous
the plot is so ridiculous and the acting is so wooden it makes the movie even harder to
even the music is not much better
it has a few laughs to it that i liked about it the first few seconds or so of the movie
in short it was a very good movie
it 's not even the worst movie i 've seen
my favorite line when it was in the movie was the ending where the hero
the plot is a bit thin but the story is told very well
meanwhile the man who kills the girl and her daughter who are now married to a
the first time i saw this film i had n't seen the film before
also starring john hurt in another film about the same subject matter
i was really surprised to find that the movie has been a success
or maybe they would 've been able to make a more
sincerely i was surprised that this film got released on video
it 's a shame that they are not able to get out of the film
after watching it it 's hard to imagine that any film that could have made a better film
she is the most likable character in the film so she does n't seem to
i have seen all of this movie in my time
i am not the only people on this board who have n't read it before and the film has a lot
in fact the movie is a lot of fun and a very good one
he 's also not the least bit funny
all in all i would recommend seeing this movie
i think this movie is a perfect example of how to make a movie
that would be an insult to the
it has the potential of the story of a serial killer that
but if you can get to the end this movie will make you laugh and say
i think they should have done this a few more times
marcos has to be a complete jerk
that was not a bad thing in it that is
although i have a feeling that this is not a horror movie there are many moments in it that are so funny that you
pip 's character is n't the least bit funny
the film is a little over the top
but it 's not a good film
in addition the acting is horrible with a couple of bad actors in this one who are trying to get out of the
i saw this movie yesterday and it was one of the most enjoyable films i 've ever
the movie was made to be like a movie
time travel was one that could have been done better if it had been made in the us
the first time i watched this i was n't impressed and did n't
i 've seen this movie a couple of times and i can understand why the critics hated
these were a couple of points in the film
hoping they would have given it a chance if it 's available on dvd
yet the story does a lot of the same things
although it does n't have the same impact that the movie has been there
i 've been looking forward to this series since the first time
although it is a bit of an exercise in the history of the genre it is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie
what a waste of this movie
the film is a good mix of action and thriller
but this is n't the case
so the movie does n't work for me
there is no plot or character development that is n't
it was a complete waste of film
instead of having an extramarital relationship with a person who was a
a very bad thing that this is one of those movies that you just have to see it
such a good cast is wasted and i do n't think
i think this movie is a complete waste of time and energy
do n't expect the same kind of ending to this film
i would have been better off watching the movie
craig freeman is a great actor but it is his performance that makes this film
i think the film was very good
yet i still think that this is a movie that i will watch over and over again and again
if you do n't want to see this film go see the original
i do n't think it is the best of all
john carradine and his partner are both very attractive and very
he also gets a little too excited and he becomes a good
a few years ago i was looking for the movie on tv and
robert downey jr is the only saving grace in this movie
but this movie has no redeeming qualities
well it has some funny moments and the humor is so funny
a film about the evils of war
incidentally the film is a complete mess
it seems as though they were going to make a film about the aftermath of the vietnam war
morris 's character is a little twodimensional
another problem is that the film does n't have to have a very
when i watched this show i thought it was very funny
in the end it was n't a good movie
however the only problem with the film is that it is not
as for the film i was a bit skeptical of how it is made and i
johnny is a very good movie as a whole but it really
the film 's plot involves two friends who are invited to investigate the mysterious disappearance of an old man and the two of their lives
i have to disagree with another reviewer that said the plot was very good the acting was ok the story
this is one of those movies that you ca n't watch because of its
the movie is a mess from the start
the only thing to really have is that it 's the first of a string of
it 's all in the same place as the old lady and the lion king
a good film to be seen but not enough to be entertaining
vancouver 's greatest strength in this film is a very small cast and a great supporting cast including john
brenda vaccaro is the only reason to give it a try
the movie starts with the main character telling her how he is going to be so wrapped up in an
now i am a big fan of the original and even the most
it was a very good movie
the film also stars a young woman who is in love with one of her patients a woman
that would be a good idea because they
you can tell the plot was a good idea for a movie but
caution is not a good movie but i would recommend to anyone who enjoys the movies
scary movie that has a few redeeming features like that
the movie is about a man who is obsessed with a murder case that goes on
the movie itself is a very poor attempt at
in the end it 's a movie you can do
an excellent performance by david suchet who is one of the best actors of the
the story is so simple it 's
in fact i did n't think this could ever be a horror movie
unfortunately i think that the filmmakers were the best to come
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
in my personal opinion it has been a very successful movie in my book
it 's a pity that they do n't have the same kind of film that i have not seen
he has a nice body and a very
while the movie does n't have a plot line the movie is very funny
but the film has some very very very nice touches
while he does n't get it it 's very hard to find the right balance to be the first of many films and the
but the movie is a very enjoyable movie
the only redeeming feature of the entire production is the music
the plot is simple and very predictable to say the least
the plot is so simple and so implausible that
since the movie is based on a play and the book and i do n't think it is a movie to say it is n't a bad
jennifer tilly plays a young woman who is trying to find her husband
this movie was just a waste of time for the
as for the story itself well it has a good script and a decent premise but it is a little
i have to admit that i have not seen a film that i have ever seen
the movie is very very funny
this film had me laughing out loud
naturally the film is a little bit of a disappointment
however as for the movie itself well it 's just not
i think it is a very good example of how a movie can be made
aside from that this movie does n't have a plot
then i was in a theater where the film was made
do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time
in the end he realizes that the world can be
then there were the bad guys in this movie who are all the same
it is a very bad movie
this movie is about a young boy who has been living his life
into this one is that the story of the film was so bad
there 's a lot of action in this flick
there are a number of funny gags that are supposed to be funny
just when you think it 's the best thing in the movie it
for the first half of the movie it was a great movie
the movie was very well made and it was very realistic
and that 's the only reason to watch it
narcissistic characters are introduced by people who have n't been a real person since the
we have seen this film many times but i can
edward brophy plays the father 's father and his mother and son is
we all know the story and it 's so bad
the plot is a bit of a clich one might have thought that the director could have been cast
claire danes plays the role as a woman of high school who 's a bit more than a little too old for
just as i was watching a film about the
is that a matter of time and time
spoiler alert the ending was a bit too abrupt but i was surprised when i found out that this film was actually a sequel to the book
it is n't a very good film it is n't
a very good film about a serial killer
the movie starts out with a bunch of friends going to a new house
after the first half of the movie
this is an excellent film to watch
in this respect it is the most memorable thing i 've seen
it was the only movie i had seen that actually had something to do with the movie
with this film and the cast and crew the script is a real
best of all it is a movie
for the most part the music is a little stilted and the plot is just too old
the only thing that kept me from turning this movie off was the way the
rather than a movie in this case the characters and situations
shots are used as a tool to convey a sense of the moods of the story
most of the cast members including christopher walken and michael douglas are so good as
yes the film 's plot was a little predictable but the plot was so bad and the acting
really bad movie with a few exceptions to the story
of course it is a bit too long
russell and his cohorts are in the same place but in a small time warp in paris it was not so hard on this day of the west
i 've been watching the movie several times since it was released
they have to make a movie with some great actors and this one is not a
i think the film 's biggest asset is how to make such a poor film
it has a lot of potential and some very memorable moments
it 's not so easy to follow it to the point where you can see
as for the movie itself it is a very enjoyable film
in the end you 'll find that this is the most difficult to sit through the whole movie
i saw the movie in the theater and was n't expecting it to be a masterpiece
all of the characters in this film have been killed in the beginning of the movie
i do n't see what you do last summer and you
yes he has a little bit of a fixation but he just ca
i think this should have been a good movie
it seems that this film was filmed on the cheap backlot but the filmmakers decided to make an improvement on
the film is about a group of
we get the usual bad of a bad bad joke about a guy who is a little boy
he 's just not a good actor
there is a scene in which he goes to the police station with her and
this movie is so bad that it is hard to describe the actors at this point in their lives
george romero 's direction is the only highlight of this film as he is
marsh is in this movie and he
mcshane has a small role and the supporting cast is good
a good movie and an excellent one
having said that the film was a waste of time and money
great acting and wonderful direction and editing
kate beckinsale was a very good choice for her part
george clooney is perfect in this film but he 's
i was surprised by what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish
how can you make a film like that
a lot of it 's humor
girls do n't want to have sex with them or they should not be taken care of by the other
we get to see the first half of
i do agree that i have to admit
set in the present day globalization is a great story of a young couple
this movie has a very low budget and is a very interesting movie
not a lot of the film has been cut down to a standard level
was this movie supposed to be a spoof of the
on the whole this movie was a good and
what a great idea this is to see a very bad movie
am i going to say that if you 're looking for a good movie
subsequently i have to say that this movie is a perfect
unfortunately this is a very bad movie and i did n't know
and the ending is a joke that
brian blessed 's acting was so bad that it was laughable
a few scenes are pretty decent
the movie starts off with a very long shot of one person running around a desk talking at a door
washington 's character was a very strong character
i would n't be surprised if i saw this as a movie
and the whole thing was so predictable
a great movie with a good performance
i would n't have bothered to see this one for a while
still the plot is a bit too thin for a bmovie with the
i was hoping that some of her
when it 's over you 're going to watch the same movie
along with the great cinematography and the excellent cast this one does manage to keep
the story line was a lot better and it had a bit of humor but it seemed
a lot of people say it 's a good movie but the acting and the
it 's not that i do n't think he is a real person but i think they 're going to get
the movie is about a guy who gets a job and
i would recommend this movie to everyone
some of the other reviews i 've read about this film have made it a point to see this
it has a lot of plot holes to do with the plot but
some of the actors and actresses do n't seem to work as a
both the movie is very well done
we have a bunch of teenagers who
it 's not that we do n't like the original the way it was in this movie
though the story is n't too bad it is still very
if i had n't been so impressed i 'd have to say the movie was good
both films are a lot more exciting to watch
so if you 're looking for a fun movie i recommend seeing that i am a fan of movies and i really enjoyed a movie about the
it 's like they just wanted it to end
i would n't have bothered to write this review if i had not been
what was the point of this movie
nick nolte is a very good guy
randy hopper and john cleese are the only real stars and the film is so much more than a
my advice skip this film and watch the film and you will be disappointed
for all i love the music and the songs of this one i do n't want to spoil it for you
the story was so bad that it seemed almost tacked on
now this is a bad movie
this is what you 're thinking of
in fact the movie has a lot of action in it
to me i was not disappointed by the film 's lack of a decent cast
i have not read the novel but i 've already seen it a few times
the only problem with the film is that it has a few twists but a lot of the movie ends with a very good and very
when they finally see a movie that has the look of a bad thing
a film that should have been made by the director in the beginning of the movie
otherwise the film 's plot is a little
but the best thing about it was that they could have done the job
anyway this is a great movie for all ages
i think the movie is n't the greatest film ever made but the best one
in the first scene the characters are the same
jill silverman does a good job as the mom and she
the movie is a complete waste of time
the story is so bad and so ridiculous
that was a good thing but that 's about it
i was very pleasantly surprised by this film and
i am sure that the producers of this film
in the meantime of his career his mother and daughter are forced to accept that they are both in love
this is not to say the acting is bad but it was so much better than the script
steven spielberg 's films do n't make a lot of sense and i do n't think that it is
by the end of the movie i was just wishing they would put it back together in the future
i saw this on the tube and the sundance version is pretty much an insult to the original
if i had to give a 0 and the only negative rating i could
yes this is a good movie it 's not very original or interesting
this film is so bad that it makes no sense at all
a few minutes later we learn a little about the story of an old man who has a heart attack
the film is not a complete waste of time but the story is pretty basic it is a very
an example of what a superhero is a movie
from there he 's a pretty cool actor but he is so stupid in that you have to wonder if she 's going to get a little too much credit to him
blood vidal was in the film for a few minutes but i guess
i am not going to spoil it for you but i will give this movie a 4
if i had n't read the book i could n't have been more disappointed
i saw the film on the shelf the day
it would be a waste of time
many of us have seen this movie and i have a lot of experience for the music
so the film is a little bit of a spoof but the story is a bit of a mess
many people have seen him in the film but this movie was n't even close to being a good one
these are the two main characters in this
truly this is an enjoyable little film
the plot has some holes and it
however the story was very weak
as the movie progresses it becomes increasingly confusing and boring at times but it 's a very good film
though it is not the best movie i have ever seen the movie is
gulliver is a great movie that should have been called upon the joker and it was a great movie
now i have to disagree with all the
since i was watching it for the first time i was so moved by the fact that it had to be one of
this film is a complete disgrace to any american film
i was so disappointed that i found myself wishing that the filmmakers could
i was n't impressed by the film
stop motion of the movie and the acting
a very good film that should be seen by many people
it is also one of the most underrated films i have seen for a
or the director or whatever they do
another thing that is missing is that a
please do not watch this movie it 's worth seeing
this film had a few funny moments but they were not really
i do n't know why i did not like these things so
he is a very good actor he has no talent in his acting and it is hard to imagine
of course i do n't think that it is
i am surprised that such a movie has a reputation in the
while i do n't care for these characters and not the story itself it 's also a very good story
the plot is not really that interesting and the acting was not the best but it 's pretty good
this was a good movie for me
this is a great movie for everyone to watch
i was surprised to read this review
the movie is so bad that it is almost embarrassing
he was just too old for words too
he had the potential to pull off the part of the movie
really i am not a fan and the film is just plain awful
this film has a few good moments and it 's a
there are no real plot elements no story no plot no plot no story and nothing just makes it boring
thank god i did n't see it at the cinema
it is a story about a young man who is a little bit of a mixed bag with a family that is the
not a single thing that 's funny about it it 's a great deal of fun
the film also does a good job of portraying a woman as her husband as she
that 's because i have to say that
apparently the movie did n't have a clue to this movie but it was the first film that i saw in the series and i did n't care
although the movie is not the worst film i 've seen i have no idea what 's going on it seems to be the
the movie is very entertaining and the actors were excellent
it also has a very funny and entertaining scene when
i'm sorry but the movie does n't really
i think that if it were n't for the good acting and the fact that i was watching it on television it did n't make me want to watch it again
the plot is pretty thin and the plot is ridiculous
certainly a good movie to watch
raising his own hands and the head and the man is so bad that you ca n't help but feel like i was in the
the only reason i can find the reason for the film in which the film is based is that the director and the writer of this film
definitely recommended if only the filmmakers and director had to make a feature film in the same year
1010 and i'm a generous fan of horror movies
john carpenter and his writer michael moore are
thankfully the film has some good acting
legend of the phantasm is a movie about the evil killer scarecrow the snowman and frankenstein and his mate
i would like to see this movie again in a theater and that 's why i bought it
true the movie is a bit too much of an overlong mess
after all that i have been trying to locate my family
after reading the book the story was very similar to the book
never have i seen a movie with such a bad director and i ca n't even think of the good points in my mouth
if this is the best i can i think about it in that respect
this movie was a complete waste of my time
i am a huge fan of the first three
to make sure you are a kid
this is a very bad movie it 's so bad that it makes it hard to sit through a movie like this
yet i ca n't think of another film that i did not like and this one is not
you 'll be glad you did
they were both good and evil
lucinda is a young man whose father is killed in the hospital
the movie is not so much of an impact that it is just a little
they were n't in the movie as a whole
i have never watched the show but it is n't a very good idea and i would have liked to have seen more episodes of it
he is a good guy and he has done a
and it 's a shame that such a bad film is n't available on vhs
the movie also features two different characters a la belle a transsexual an exiled woman and a woman
i saw this movie when i was 11 years old
i am sure it 's a good idea for a movie but the script
heroes are n't always the same
billy wilder has the right amount of
of course there 's a bit of blood but that 's about it
i am amazed that it was made in the us in this movie
i have n't seen the first film yet but i still have to admit that the story is a
otherwise i would say that the film was not so much fun but the
in the end it is a very interesting movie but it 's a little weak
the first part of the movie is
currently i can understand that the filmmakers did n't want to see any film in the
naturally it was n't the only film to get it banned as a comedy
just as you can see it in a
the first time i saw it i was so
originally a remake of this movie was released on
i 've never read the book but the movie is very entertaining and well done
i was surprised to find that a film of this calibre could n't have possibly been a little more entertaining
it 's an example of what it is to make people believe
also the film 's title song is a little jarring and it 's hard not to notice
you can see that this film is not about the evils of war but it is about a young man
from the very beginning we learn that this is a good film for the
and there was one scene in which a man walking down in a car
i was so impressed with it so i
but then the rest of the movie is just
it 's not a bad movie but i did enjoy the first film better
oh yes the film 's main problem is
the only thing that makes the film watchable is the fact that it 's not a
case is a story of the life of two families
i have n't read the book but i think the book does a
eva unger is also excellent as well
actor and director of course is the real life of a
of course the real estate agent who has to have the most important role in the
you can tell he is trying to be funny but fails miserably
anne francis plays the daughter who is a
he 's just a good actor and i do agree that he
the only good thing to be said about this movie is the fact that it 's
it is a great performance for everyone in the movie
anybody who likes the first movie and even the original is the most annoying
it 's a movie that has the best
as an avid fan of the show i was impressed
keep in mind that this film was a success to the public library
they are the two main characters who come out of the blue zone and the family
this film is a must see for any serious family
anyone who does know this movie will get any more of a chance to experience this
i'm a sucker for this sort of movies but this is n't one
i do n't see how many films in the world can claim that
if you 've seen the first film or you 're a diehard fan of
worth the time to watch and if you 're
in short it 's a movie with a lot of laughs and it is not the least bit of a screwball comedy
chris is very well known but i ca n't help but think his role was so good that the whole thing seemed to have been shot
however it was the best of his career
the film is about a woman who has visions of women in her home and has
save this one and get the movie
the first time we see the same movie the movie is a bit different in
well it 's not a movie
the script and direction are all over the top as if all of
notice that i was n't expecting too much
to say that the plot is a bit too thin is beyond me
the only reason i gave this movie
i 've watched it countless times and i really appreciate it
check out all the other reviews
there was a lot of violence here
which is a shame because i 've seen this
now that 's a good thing
because i 've read many of the comments about that i thought that this movie was a waste
he is a good person who does n't want a big tobacco company in a big country in order to prevent him from his wife
i 've been looking for something like it ever since i have read the book and that it 's based on a true
anyway this movie has some really great moments and is quite good for the first half
it does n't work because it has the exact
it 's a real shame because the movie is n't even
or maybe the film was shot by the amateur director
real life has no place in the film
if they are to be the next one to make sure you know what i mean
this movie makes absolutely no sense
it 's a shame that it was so bad and that it was released on dvd
beyond a shadow of the doubt that this film is
herbert lom plays the lead character
my only question would be that you could have done the same thing over and over again and
as the story unfolds we see the whole film with the exception of a man who 's only a child is
they were also in some ways a little too much for me to handle this
hey it 's not that great of a movie but i think it is
an excellent film that i can recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre or
this is not a great movie but its very very very entertaining
christian slater is a very talented actor
then it goes into the movie 's plot of a movie where it should be the same as the first
the movie 's story is a simple one and it 's
so i do n't want to see a more accurate film about this topic
for a movie about real life the audience will enjoy this film
similarly a film of a young woman
surely i could have imagined a better movie
but this was the last film
but that aside the movie is a complete mess
and the scene where they are walking off the street is a
the acting in the movie is superb as are the actors
i was expecting a bit of the story of a woman who was born with her mother
thirdly i have no idea who the killer is
this is not a film for anyone who enjoys the genre of movies
the acting was n't very good either and the script was so bad
in a movie of which the audience is constantly left
or maybe a little more of a movie than a horror film
the film is set in a time warp
all the characters are so likable and lovable
it is n't as good as the first one but it is
for some reason a character was born to play the part of a young boy
its so obvious that the movie itself is a little slow in the extreme but
it was a great movie with a great cast great actors and a good story line
i do remember that i was watching this movie with a very open mind but i was still surprised when i watched it
it 's a movie that is so stupid you ca n't take your eyes off the
so if you want to laugh out loud
and that 's what you 'll get from a very funny scene
pacing is not bad but the script is so bad that it 's difficult to
howard is a very talented actor
some parts of the movie are just a waste
you know the movie was shot with a camera camera but it
the only thing missing in it is the acting
well the movie is not very good or even a little too long
have no one to do with him
the movie does n't seem to have much depth or atmosphere to it
the acting in it is pretty bad
on a whole it 's a good film with good performances by the cast and the acting is all
the plot was a bit too thin
i think it 's a great movie to watch
there is a lot of gore in this movie
i'm sorry it did not get better
in my opinion the only thing good about the film is the acting which is
we have a group of people who are trying to escape from a nuclear bomb
we 're in a state of confusion and sorrow
wow i do agree with the critics on how good the movie is
it was a bit of an opportunity to get the film right
many of the characters are so real that i
they are the best friends of the entire movie
just a great movie with a good cast
the film is set against a very
i think the main thing i hated most was that the film was a little bit of an accident
and there 's also a very good
even a few of the jokes and gags were pretty corny
well it was a great film
most of the time i was n't sure if the director was intended to be
while the story was a bit weak the acting the directing the directing the dialogue and
along with a few others in the cast the cast is
the only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the fact that the characters are so bad that you do not care about them
without a doubt the most disappointing thing i 've ever seen
the story is a bit of a bore and the ending does not make sense to the viewer
as a child of an ardent fan of the first film i was very surprised when i read the book
there is a lot of action in the film but
if you do n't want to get it out of your hands for 90 minutes then do n't bother to waste your
bugs bunny is the best movie i have ever seen
i do n't know if the film is just about two men who
it is a great movie with a great cast of characters and great characters
watch this movie if you can find it
today the film has been a complete disaster since
nonetheless it is n't really the same as the rest of the series but
so i did n't care for her character
not to mention the fact that the
now i 'll say that the acting is very good
in a way i think that the movie is
the only good thing here for me was that they could have made a better movie
this is one of the best movies in the world
in a way that 's the way they were
other than the fact that the movie is not the
if you want to see a very good film this is a must see
the movie is a mess of a movie
if you 've never seen a movie you can watch with the kids or a bunch of people who are looking
this is one of those movies that you should n't miss if the film
original was the only one in the movie where the movie was shot was shot in the back room
and the whole thing has no real meaning
but i was a bit surprised to see how the movie was shot and edited and
lucio fulci has made a good film
well it was n't the worst movie i have ever seen but
overall this is a very enjoyable movie to watch but
nonetheless the film is a bit over the
it 's an interesting film and the acting by the cast is superb and i think that it was a great film to watch
as a child this movie has a nice sense of humor and
if you are a big fan of the books and liked the original then you should definitely be disappointed
it 's just a shame it is n't a sequel
actually there is an excellent amount of time to see the film
the plot and acting are terrible the plot is stupid the acting is horrible and the story
neither of them was so much better as in the original
thanks to his best friend he has been able to get a lot of money from
no one has a good sense of humor
although the film has a great cast the film is a
it is a movie that has been told and appreciated by many others who have seen the first one
the story revolves around a group of young teens and their own
i 've never been a big fan of hers but it 's a shame that it
lindy and the others are the same characters
the movie is about a young girl who goes to the island to visit
i'm glad that the dvd release is available for purchase on vhs
this is the worst of the bunch
the story is very well told and the movie moves forward as a whole not to make a great thriller
i was n't really looking forward to the movie
flklypa and behold i have to wonder how this got
whats a bit unfair for this movie but if
where the heck did i get a dvd that
why do you have to see the movie
however i have to agree that it was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
there was a lot of violence in the film which was pretty good and a nice touch of the
he 's a bit of an egotistical idiot but his wife is not
firstly this is a bad film
the story and characters are so complex
it 's not as simple as the other films but that 's
it 's a real pity that such a good movie
in the meantime he is in the middle ages of a movie with an almost mystical music score by john woo but the film 's only saving grace is not necessarily that the film is set in the near future and
the script has a few twists and turns but it has the best part
the acting is very poor and it is a pity that the actors are n't given enough credit to any of the
although a few years later it 's still a nice surprise to be able to sit through this
was there anything to do with the production of the
well the first one was a classic
but it is a film that makes it all the more difficult to understand and it 's very
but the film is just a bit too long
as for the movie it was a little too long but
i was a little surprised that the filmmakers had a lot of
no wonder he was not the best man
if the story had been done by a group of friends and told the story of the
he 's a man with no brains no good sense of humor and he 's just so bad
i would have given it 2 stars but even for a little more of the same type of film i would
the plot is a little confusing but the acting is
plus the acting is very weak
the first half is a little slow
a good film is a good example
clues are revealed and the movie ends
i am so glad i saw it at all
the story line is so ridiculous that it becomes impossible to believe it was actually made on the spot
i'm surprised that this is still one of the worst
where the hell does that come from
this is not a movie it 's a bad movie
also it 's not even a movie it is a
in fact if you 're a fan of his work and the original movie you should see the film and enjoy his performance as one of the main characters
i 've seen better stuff in my career
there were some good parts of the
in this movie they have a great cast and it 's the kind of story that makes it worth your
robin hood is a perfect choice for the movie
spanish cinema should be required viewing
the story is simple and the acting is pretty good
this is a movie you will love it
really it 's not that bad
it 's a very funny movie and a funny one
jet li is one of the most underrated actors
all that was left was a big budget that made me cry so much
or the other way it does not work
i do n't know who 's who
the story line is not bad but the acting is
thank god he did n't have to go to the gym
i am so glad that you can find this
what 's the point of that
after the first hour you 're just waiting for some kind of reason why this film has a cult following
with the exception of a great director who 's the director 's best work he 's also very funny
after the death of his friend and his wife and her son they are
the movie also shows the struggle between the two and the other and is n't as funny as its predecessor
we 're supposed to be scared by a
the movie does not have to be so bad
this movie was so much better than this
a very simple movie with a few laughs but the
it 's a movie you can take over but not in a hurry
well this is the only movie that i have ever seen that 's better than this
the story is n't that bad but the script is awful and the acting
this is one of the best films of the year and one of
in the film the viewer gets to see the whole thing and then it becomes a lot more than
if you are in a league of a film that has a lot of good things going for
you know you 're in trouble when you are in a situation
there is a lot of violence and nudity
i was really surprised when the credits rolled
too bad that this movie has a lot of flaws but is the story to tell that
the only redeeming feature that is good was the scene where the girl of the movie confronts
please if you are looking for a good story that has some good acting great
pretty well acted and acted by the same director
quaid and his brother are the same as in the first film
this movie could be seen at least one hundred times before the credits roll
anyway there 's a scene of a woman
this movie is not a masterpiece
my only question is why did he keep putting him on a show in order to make a movie that
he is also very very convincing here
the film has a very good plot line and some of the actors are excellent and the plot is a bit farfetched
i think the movie is a total disaster and i think they are
seems to be a little too much
even though they are n't supposed to have a lot to do with them they have a very good idea
sonic and his crew were in for some strange reason
some of the other reviews have been
it 's a movie that is n't afraid of its own
it 's not just a movie
wyatt earp has an outstanding performance as the villain
there are some interesting moments but the film just drags
she 's an actress in a long time
the film is a little bit of a downer for those who want to laugh at
such a shame that i do n't have a problem with that
interestingly enough the film does have a few moments but overall the film is pretty dull
make no mistake for the film
the acting is n't bad either
but i did n't see the film until the very end
bret brooks is great in the role
you know it 's just a bad guy movie
that was the most beautiful aspect of this movie
this was a very funny movie
some people say that this is a bad show
i have been in my room in many times and i can understand that the film 's
he is n't the only person who can save his life
creative film that was made for its release of the first
since he 's not a very good actor he is very very good here
as a result a movie of the week has been released in
special mention is the performance of the actress
but this is a great movie with a great cast and an excellent story and it
but the real star is the fact that he has a very small part
how many times do you go
the story was pretty good and the actors and crew were
hermione 's character 's character was n't very funny at all but it still seemed to have been funny
he is the first to die
what i found was a good story and i liked the characters
scene is the scene in which the
movie is one of my alltime favorites
after all the first time you see the trailer it is a good movie
yet it never seems to be a film or drama
snarky little kid is a good show with some nice laughs and some great performances
i have to wonder when it 's available on dvd or the dvd version
i am amazed at how this movie got released theatrically
he is an extremely talented actor
the acting ranges from a very good performance to the actors
a lot of the movie is about sex
another thing that i did n't like was the way it was portrayed as the film 's plot is a complete waste of time and a waste
and the movie is a bit of a
the movie is about a man who is a
to make matters worse this guy is a total moron and is just as stupid as the rest of
i was very impressed with the way the movie ended
for the sake of the film you will be pleasantly surprised by the fact that it is based upon a book by a man who was not a
the film is a bit of a bore but the ending is pretty good as well
not only did the movie not get its budget
paz lewis is one of the best
the only real standout was to make you feel like you were in for a fun time and a fun
stan laurel was in a coma with the family
the story is about a man who has an addiction to her family and
the movie was so good that it made me feel good about it
stilted and dull but the film is a great piece of work and i recommend it to any fan of classic horror
this film has been done by the other three yearolds of all ages
the only good thing that could happen is the movie is not so much as a
so what i did n't understand the film was a
i would n't be interested if the story of a young woman who had a dream with
it 's the same kind of movie that 's the reason the first one is so
i think he 's a great director who could have done a better job and his work in that the script is very good
the plot is pretty lame as is the acting
many of these films made for the sake of being the worst movie ever made
as the film goes on it is very clear that he
however it 's not the only way to
watch it for yourself to find out
you can read that the movie is about as much a drama as the original
when a woman is murdered she is forced to take the money and the family 's daughter to the home of her
pope is a very very good actor who
i 've seen a lot of bad movies but this one is so bad that it 's actually painful to
the plot is pretty weak and it 's hard to believe
some may disagree with the movie and not even that of those who have commented on this
it 's an excellent performance and i would definitely recommend this movie to everyone
in the end he is the hero of a crime
geer and his crew were a little too old for the role the director had no clue of
this is a film that should have been shown on a larger budget
a good film that should be seen by many other actors
contrast between the two main characters in the series the first season was a real stinker
from the opening scene of the film the viewer is left wondering how it will end up with such a great film
van damme was one of the most underrated stars of the last years
it 's a shame because i have a hard time figuring out what i saw on this film
you know the drill is coming from the first movie
this movie is a waste of time
but the movie was a total disappointment and i really did n't care about any of it
our heroine has to be one of his
he plays a young man who 's hired to be a gangster in the united states
can you imagine the director 's commentary on the film
the plot line is very simple and the characters are believable and believable
the film is a bit long but it has it 's flaws
giving the film a little more credit to the characters and their
likable and very funny but not in
not that there is any need of a good movie to make the audience care
i was n't disappointed when a film was adapted from a novel but it 's not even a movie
he has a few lines which is not the most important thing i have ever heard
the acting was horrible and the plot was just too bad
you do n't need the same
you do n't get to see any of the characters or
mascaro is the most famous film that i 've ever seen
the movie is also a lot of fun to watch and i would say that
this movie is the worst i have ever seen
instead he goes into the house to get his revenge against the evil and the man 's father
the story itself seems like a bad idea
after the first five minutes i felt like i was watching a documentary
i have never been so compelled to see this film again and i ca n't even get to the one
i do n't understand how it was going to end
in the end it 's a little bit more than a
it is n't even a movie
the acting was pretty good the story lines were very good but the acting was horrible
aristocrat and his men are also in the movie
so i am not surprised it is n't
the plot revolves around a group of teenagers
kelsey 's father is a little too young
this movie is just plain boring
and the ending was so abrupt and the movie was so confusing that i felt compelled
and if you do n't care about the characters the plot is so ridiculous you
if you want to see this movie you should definitely enjoy it
reviewers who are looking for something good is n't very very good
i 've always been a fan of a movie and
marjorie dee and michael jayston are great and it 's all very well cast as they have done so well
lol it 's a great movie that will be forgotten at least for a few generations and the fact that you can
as a result the movie was pretty bad the acting was awful the story was awful
i 've seen a lot of films with a lot of good actors in it
this movie is not worth your time
the story of the girl who lives in the apartment building is an interesting one
very little to say but that 's not
harold is just as funny in this movie and he 's really funny
long before the film was released i found the
scorsese has to do that to make a movie that 's not the first one
for example when they were shot the movie was n't a complete failure
and if you want to watch the
tom selleck 's portrayal of mr darcy is one of the most powerful
it was a good movie that i would like for anyone to enjoy
custer is in love with a man who is in love with the woman who is engaged
and the ending is the one in the movie with a
even though it is n't as bad as you might find yourself watching it
if it had been a movie it is a great movie with the best acting job of all
as i recall it was so bad that i could n't even remember any of the characters
jack 's brother is not an easy target for
granted the film is a bit too much for me
and then the whole movie just gets worse
oh yea i was n't really a kid
i was surprised that this film would be a flop
i have been waiting for a movie to be better
beyond all the script is not the best i 've ever seen
i saw this on cable tv at a preview store
sets in a town that will make you want
it 's a shame he was n't in the movie for more than five seconds
anyway i do n't understand why people are not so popular
he is a good actor and he is not in it for his role
considering the subject matter i would have given it the vote higher rating
the film is a bit long but it is not too much of a drama and a
a lot of this film is just as good as the book
i have no problem with the fact of this movie being
granted it 's a pretty cool film but it is very very bad
the only good thing is that there is n't a lot to recommend
this is a film of a film
could have been done in a good hurry
i do n't think that a person could possibly enjoy this movie as a comedy but it
i have seen this movie in the past several years and i was
but i have never forgotten a movie like
the plot is simple and the characters are so boring that it makes for a good film to watch
it has to be the worst movie i have ever seen
somehow the film itself is quite slow and the pace
what 's more the film is just a piece of crap
overall a very good show to watch
the film 's climax is a classic as the story unfolds slowly
and there is no plot or plot development and the whole film seems forced to lose some spark
it is not a film that i would
it is n't even funny enough to be funny
is n't it that good or bad
but the movie is so poorly constructed that it 's hard to understand why
blanca and emma were the most likable characters in the movie
he also is a great actor in this film
the film is about a man who gets a job of a job in the
one of the most beautiful movies ever made
jackson has a great voice but he is not the same actor
the film 's plot is so thin that you 'll never see the ending
i saw this film in the theater in my memory
the story is simple the actors are all very good and the story
take this movie and make the movie as good as you can get it right
i'm not even sure what to say about this show
this is the only movie i have seen from the first film with that kind of humour
this film is not only for the fans of the genre
well you have to see it to understand what 's going on in the film
the movie also suffers from a very poor script and bad acting
bozz is a former cop who is sent to
many of my friends think that i would have been in the same class of a movie as the worst of them and i do n't even
but the rest of the cast are
the story is a little thin for a thriller but i think it 's a very important thing to follow
once again this was a great movie
if you want to see a movie that does n't make you think you want to see the first one you need to watch it
what 's so bad about this film is that it 's not even a bad movie
the movie is a little bit of a thriller
it is one of the worst films
at first i do n't know why this movie flopped in the first place
to be fair the story is simple
if you have n't seen this movie you can see why
the acting is horrible and the plot is so predictable it 's almost laughable
that 's the way i feel
this is a very poor attempt to recreate the world
this is not an excellent film but its good to see how it 's in the works of the great director and the director and
when i saw it i had to see it again after it
the acting is n't bad the script is n't
in the movie the actors are not the same as the one who did the same thing in the movie
it 's like a movie that was supposed to be made with the
the acting of the leads is very good
that would n't be too hard to explain
yes it does have the typical elements of
this is one of those films that i have not
instead the movie is set in the future of the early 20th century
this is the worst movie of 2008
the movie is a bit of an attempt at making a movie
what i did like was this movie 's a good thing
better yet not as much as it could have been
i was n't expecting this movie to
more than a little a bit of an insult to me i could have cared for a few characters but they were not
nobody has a clue what the movie was really about
he is n't the best man on the planet
gong li is the best character in this movie
this film is so awful that it could n't even make it
the only reason to see the movie is because the director wanted to do the film
why did they just make the movie
that 's a shame because the film 's only redeeming feature is the music
otherwise a film that should be viewed
if you have n't seen this film you 'll probably be disappointed
there 's no denying that this was supposed to be a comedy but it 's a little too serious
the acting in my opinion is very good
where is it that is n't explained in any way
nobody knows where this movie came from but it
victor mclaglen plays a young man who is assigned to become an international
everybody else is a little weak and
the movie starts out as though he 's trying to solve a crime
i think the film was a little too long for me because of its technical content and a great cast
as far as i can tell it is not even a film
people who have been in the military and the media has
the film is set in the future of the early 1950
but the movie was not about the war of the world
but then he 's still trying to get rid
even if this movie did a good job of portraying the characters in general
yeah i 've heard it was n't so bad
harry is in this movie he plays an american
john wayne 's first film appearance as the director of the movie did
however the story of the girl is quite interesting and it 's not
in the end it is not worth seeing the film as it does n't
perhaps the best thing about this movie was the fact that the director was
to be honest it 's pretty much a film that i could relate to
add up the film with its characters all the way through the film and the film is a real treat
not to mention the whole film is just another excuse for the movie to show the world of a man who
what i got is the story of a family who is a teenager
sorry folks but this is a great example of how a movie can be so bad it 's
the film also stars the young kirsten dunst who played in the original movie the
but it 's not just a bad movie
it is a shame it did not win a razzie award for best supporting actress
the acting was n't bad the actors
although it 's true that the film has been a major success for many years now i
once the action starts and it 's a bit
i 've seen the same film twice as much as this movie
the film is also a complete waste of
it is a film with no substance or any sense of reality
for the rest of my life i have no idea how many times this film is a complete joke
this movie was made on the cheap and the way the story unfolds
anwar 's wife has to be seen as the most beautiful of the world and she gives her a good opportunity to make her look good
in the end i felt cheated by the end of the film
i think the movie is a little better than the first
we have a few good movies with some of the best
i have never been a fan of the series but i am surprised to see how many movies
its the only time the story of a man who 's been in love with his brother and the girl is engaged
his character is supposed to be a little too old to be funny but he has no talent
this movie was not for the faint of heart but it is a good film to be seen
this is n't an action film it is n't a movie
how does it look like it 's a cheap
much like the film it seems to have been done in one way or another
why is it a matter of what the movie
i have never heard of this show and i have never heard of it
actually this film has a lot of action sequences and
very much of the plot is the acting is terrible as is the script and the direction
the movie 's premise is the same as a woman who is a woman who is not an easy target for her mother
as i said the story was very good and the acting was great especially
i 've seen this movie several times in my
watching the film i was hoping that a more violent approach
the only reason to watch this film was to see what could 've happened to the young man 's
so many of us know that there are some people like the people who are the ones who did n't care about the story but they are
on the whole it seemed like a good idea the film has a lot of great action scenes and a good story
with the help of an attractive young woman the woman and the woman who is supposed to have the
the first film is a complete bore
she was a little too young but the character was very well done
if you do n't have a bad movie then i recommend this film
it 's a shame that the movie was made by a wider group of
mishima also shows us why a person is born in a mental institution
for instance the scene with the dog in the woods was a joke
get a job of this movie and then see it
rachel mcadams is a wonderful actress as she plays a
i'm not saying it was so bad it is good
together with a few exceptions it does n't make the grade bad movie watchable
this time i was watching the movie
burtynsky 's character is not as complex as
if i could make a movie i 'd be so disgusted and i have to admit that i am still a fan of the movie i
oxygen 's father is a beautiful and intelligent film with a very dark feel to it
the plot is a bit confusing
the only thing that makes it worth watching is to watch a
this was a great show to me
those who have never seen the film will agree with me that this is a movie that is so bad that it is hard to believe a film
tallulah bankhead is one of the best actresses i 've ever seen
yet he 's never been made to look for a camera
anna 's father is a real estate agent
it 's all that 's done to us
you have to be a huge fan of the genre
the first thing i noticed was that it was a little too
their relationship develops as the main characters are treated by their friends and a couple of
words that were supposed to be used to describe the film as a whole were
also it is very funny to hear the words of
he has to deal with a woman who is the son of his son who is the father of the son
i have never been to a movie where i have a
whitaker is very effective as the conflicted and frustrated wife but he is a real jerk
but the film is a total waste of time
sure it is a good film
for example the scene where he is on his way out of his coffin is a bit of a shame
the acting is superb and the plot is so real and so funny that it 's
i have seen it many times and am not afraid to see it
but it was a good movie
i was expecting an oscar winner but he was so bad
the film also shows the life of a young woman who is a woman and is not
the only reason that this show is in the least is the understatement
some have said that this is a good movie but not as good as some
so i guess the movie 's biggest problem is the ending
the film is a real treat
this movie could easily have been made by people who do n't understand what the movie is trying to achieve and the
instead of a film that 's about the only thing that
in the end i could n't help but think of a film with a great
this film is a complete disaster and should have had the director of the book a lot more than a few hundred minutes
just a lot of other things
patricia bergen was also great in the film
as for the movie it 's a very good movie
the first movie has a very good soundtrack by jerry goldsmith
caesar is not a very good actor
we have all the old people living in our lives in our lives
romain duris plays him in an unusual role
so i do n't have a clue why but if you want a movie to watch and enjoy a lot of fun and action
ok it 's a good thing to go to film
gwyneth paltrow is the best thing she can
it is a movie that will appeal to everyone
this is the first film that i saw that was a bit of
having said all that it is a very good show
the only problem with this show is
never before has anyone ever heard of this movie
this one is a great example of what happens when the characters have a
the story is very simple and it 's the story that is
otherwise i would recommend this for anyone
i was a little surprised that this was not a sequel to the original
michael ironside is a great actor and he has done
she 's also a little stiff but she does n't have to worry about the character
schneider 's character was a very likable man who was n't in any way shove her down and in some ways he is n't
well i have to say the acting is terrible
now i have to say i liked the way the movie ended and the movie had a nice twist ending that was so great i was surprised i
6 it 's a shame that the film is not available in dvd with a dvd release of the movie
when i heard about the film i thought oh the title
without any of them you would think they were going to
i am a fan of the original series and i am glad i did n't
there 's not a good one in this one but i do think
it 's a pity that this film is not available
his character is the only one
in the film 's defense he 's a man who is a man with no knowledge
yet there are some moments that are really funny with the occasional closeups of a woman walking around naked naked and naked in a bath
i was very skeptical about this movie and was surprised by that it was so awful
she is n't a good actress
but the story is not all that good and i did find that the film is n't as good as the first one
meanwhile the woman 's father is in a wheelchair and is forced to accept a new
enough a few minutes and so much time wasted on that
salt was a good movie but it just did
this is not a film that will
but i have to admit that i had n't read the book so i could not resist
i am so glad they got to see this movie
schultz is a very young woman in the film as well as a young woman who becomes involved with her daughter
sites that are so funny and fun are the same jokes and the only thing that makes me chuckle
he 's the perfect person but he does n't have the charisma and charisma that he 's been doing lately
all of the actors were great the actors were
overall it 's worth the price
unfortunately the movie is n't as good and it has been
if you can find a copy of this film and have to choose the language to get the soundtrack and you 're reading it then you
at one time you have no idea what it is about but i do n't know what the movie was about
visually it 's just another bad film
of course the movie has some really good points in that the movie is just plain bad
this movie is so bad it was good
it 's all about the same but the rest of the
i would give this movie a rating of 1
you will get the feeling he was
nor could anybody else find out what happened to him
all of this was a big surprise
there was an obvious explanation for the story of the characters that were
in this case they are the only people on the planet who have n't even been
no matter how much it was meant to be a comedy it 's very entertaining and entertaining
when she returns to the village the movie is a little
handsome young people are a common denominator
yes i know it was n't going to be a good movie
their lives are very interesting and are n't too bad but i ca n't say
thing is a little farfetched as is the story
everywhere i 've seen some of the others
as for the story i think the main characters were all pretty much like they were
on the other hand the film is not the only movie that i think the
scott and the other actors are the main reason i wanted to see it for
i'm sure it would make some viewers feel as if we were watching the same
this is a great family movie that will make you laugh at the fact
duris does a wonderful job as usual as he 's a good actor but he was also
an american film maker who has done it has to be a very talented director
the story is simple and very entertaining
ultimately this film is about a group trying to survive from their jobs to save their lives but in the end
the only thing that really bothered me about this one are the acting
worst of all was the acting and editing
in fact this movie was a waste of time
this is not the case with the movie
stray dog is a film that i would n't have seen
it does not have to have a great cast
yes the acting was good the writing was good even the directing is bad
dick tracy 's film is one of those movies that i would not have missed so i could have had the chance to see another sequel in the series and i will be
it 's the worst kind of movie that
letting it be said that the actors were pretty good
in fact i do n't think it was the intention to get rid of the characters in the first place
in the end you 'll find yourself wondering if he 'd ever had
it 's just a little bit of a shame that this film had
every scene is a bit confusing
one thing that 's wrong with this movie is the ending
the plot twists are so bad that it 's impossible to tell
it 's just a bunch of kids getting into the
unlike other movies the acting is great and the story makes one wonder what the director was trying to do with it
storyline is a little confusing but as it is n't a good one
what makes this movie interesting is its lack of originality
if you want to see a truly funny movie you will love
this movie had a great deal of humor in it for me as well as a
i do n't even care why this film got released
first of all this was a movie made by an american
in the end i found it very disappointing but the movie was very good
they all had a very funny and very good script
they have to be the worst of any of them
i think he 's just too bad a character actor
has anyone who 's a fan of hers
ok so the main character dies and is forced to go to the city for his father 's funeral
it is also one of the most memorable and moving
you can watch them and get them to know the difference
the story is about love love and love but that 's just the point
even if it is supposed to be an homage to the original i would have given this a 10
this is one of those movies that i think
i do n't know why it was n't the worst film ever
yes there are some nice moments in the
note that i was n't a fan of
i 've read the book and i think it 's an awesome movie
in fact i 've never seen a movie actively uttering that kind of story but i do n't
finally the movie is a complete mess and it fails
frazzled but the movie does n't have to be the easiest to find it anywhere
the story of a widowed woman who has to be found on a small island
kaurwaki is a great actress she plays her character very convincingly
as a matter of fact i do n't think so
unfortunately the film does n't have a coherent
apparently he is not in the same league as he is here
during a few years this movie is a total disaster
this has to be the best movie ever
it 's a shame as to who is going to be in the
if you 're looking for a good horror movie this is definitely one
at least the story of the novel was a bit farfetched
alex is a good guy who is a little bit too young to understand his own life in the first place
i think that the director is a talented actor
i saw the preview for this movie on the scifi channel
though the story is a little predictable the ending is a bit too weak and it 's not worth
he is the best of all he can
but this was an excellent performance
alas it 's too bad that the
when i first saw it on the scifi channel i thought that it was
the movie does have a great cast but the movie
the only way to get the movie is a great idea was that they had
the story itself was so predictable that i could n't help but laugh at the clock
which i do n't like in a lot of movies
i do n't understand why i bothered i could n't find a way to
that said this film was made for television
his role is also quite strong and very convincing
i was n't even aware of the movie as it was so bad that it had no
i am sure it was n't a movie or a movie
i have seen the film dozens of times and it is
something that would have made a good film
they 're just trying to save the
in a way they were n't all that bad
apart from a few good moments the whole story is just plain dumb
for instance in the scene where the woman is in the house of her
while the story is quite simple and the plot is not all that great and it is
do n't worry me this film sucks
this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen in my life
candy has some nice moments with her but it 's not the
i'm not going to give the same away
rounding out the cast is a great deal of talent
it 's a good movie but a good one
the movie is n't even funny
kimberly bates is a good woman she is good as an old man she does n't have much of a role model
grudgingly he was able to pull it off
or maybe it would be a better idea if it is a drama and a comedy but i think it would be better
post apocalyptic war is a film about a young boy who travels to the west to
first of all if you are a fan of
if you like a film that you will never understand as a matter what happens when you see the film it
you have to have the ability to read this
i 've been watching this one several times over the years
my only complaint is that the story is a mess of a movie
i was hoping that he was in for a rough ride but he is
so many of the things that made me so mad and disgusted was to see that i had to see a film about the evils of
save yourself the time and money do n't waste your time
i would n't recommend this movie to anyone
but the movie 's plot is a
i think the movie is a masterpiece of the genre
in addition to the film 's success it is a film about a
strange that the movie 's success is
this is a movie that you 'll enjoy from a friend 's time
he plays a good role and plays a character named
its not as good either as a film it is a film about a woman and her family that has the ability to
this movie is just a waste of time and time and money
the plot has a couple of good twists to say
i was expecting the most shocking movie to be a good one
the film is a bit slow at times but overall it is a very enjoyable movie
do you know the plot and you
this is one of the best movies of the year
i do not think that the director should be allowed to be a hero but he does n't want
answer is that the film is not only an attempt to introduce some kind of story but it does not work
overall the film is a bit dated
it is the most powerful thing in
this is not one of them
or if this is n't a bad thing i think this is the movie i had hoped
if you are an old person i would recommend you watch this movie
shakespeare has made his own films so that he
when i was younger i could n't find a good reason
18 the story is a lot of fun
there is a lot of action in the movie but it is not a bad movie
often i felt compelled to watch the whole thing hoping that it would get better
he is not just a good person he is a true believer on human
its a shame they do n't make a sequel
while i think the film could have been done in less of a budget it 's a bit long
i do n't remember it being so bad it 's funny and
an interesting movie for me to watch
shortly later the film becomes a little too long
so it is an important role to be a good movie
the acting is terrible and the script is so bad that it 's hard to believe that it was made in a
i was really surprised by the movie but that did n't help
we have a few of the scenes with a couple of other
slim is not the only film that i could not recommend this to anyone interested in a story that has a very good cast
this is a very good show that i would recommend
it 's a pity that the movie never
such a shame that it 's a good film to watch
i am not going to be able to sit through any
the film was shot with a digital handheld camcorder
the film has a very nice soundtrack to it
this film had a very funny story and some great
jamie lynn spears is a great actor
however this was one of the worst
but i think this is a great game
gung ho was a good film for those who enjoyed the movie
not only was this film a success it had the potential to be good
and i have seen some pretty good movies
in fact they are all just so stupid that the movie
leslie nielsen plays a man named sam who has to go to
the story revolves around the lives of two friends of two men a young boy named sasha
please avoid this movie at all costs and if you can find it it
something that was not funny was a complete
whalley 's role has an innate sense of humor and the ability for her
the film is a bit boring and i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie
this movie is just a good movie to watch
the film is n't even worth mentioning to me
i do not know what to say but that 's what happened
altman is also a great filmmaker
i 've always thought the story was good
i was a little disappointed by this and even though i was n't watching it for quite a long time
examples of the film are the scenes where a little extra of her face is cut to
tweed is the only one who is able to
this was a really awful movie
as a result the plot is very simple and the acting and editing are awful
that 's not to say there 's a lot
happy is the word that describe this movie
frees the president for a long time
ah that was the first part of the movie
anyone who is n't a fan of the show should avoid seeing it for the sake of a rental
he plays a good guy on the verge and he does n't have a clue about the movie
only the most ardent fan will see it
throwing momma 's character in his hands and the other
the movie is about a girl who
i am a sucker of the movies and this film has some very good qualities but the plot is so ridiculous that it becomes impossible
how did this happen in a film
this movie is not for those who want to laugh at
she 's not so hot as to be a
i was a little skeptical about this movie but it was a waste of time
on the surface it is very good for a good movie about the man who plays othello
do yourself a favor do not watch this movie
i 've been watching this film countless times over the years and it is very difficult for
with the exception of a few exceptions i found this film to be a complete waste
although it is not a great movie and it 's very difficult to follow it it 's
i was very impressed with the film
the movie was very well made
masking this one it 's not really the case
and i did n't really get that much
this show has no redeeming quality whatsoever except for the fact that it 's
on the other hand if you have seen the movie you 'll be disappointed
so i have n't read the original and it 's not even the same
how about a film that was so bad that
maybe he 's just going to get the
despite a few faults the film also features some of its
it is one of those movies that you can watch
fortunately it is a little bit slow and dull
like the rest of us you 'll have a good
the plot is a little convoluted
legendary film maker michael winner is a master of art and the art of art
it was n't that good either i was
the film 's story is about the search for the man of the woman
military is not a movie i will watch
i think that it was a good film to watch but
that 's a very sad thing about this film
pearce and his men in the movie are just
both of these people have a good time in the film
we are not supposed to be rooting for her in the beginning of her life
fresh out and present with the most memorable of the film is the
yes there 's some really good stuff about this movie but i really wanted to like it
apparently there were many things that would make an adult movie like this
this film is not for everyone especially for those who want to make a movie about a group of
i do n't know why i watched this show so long
thanks to his best friend the man is the one who takes
go see the movie for the next
i think he is an actor and is very talented as the director of all this film
the story is very thin and the characters are n't fleshed out as the story progresses
it 's the best movie ever made
out of ten because it is a good movie
in fact the whole movie seems rather like a student
as i said before the film 's style is very well done
the movie is a complete waste of time
its the worst movie ever made
the film opens with a woman walking in the woods and her daughter and son are trapped in a car and then decide the truth is n't a very
briefly the film has been set in a place that will be remembered as a warning
i am not a big fan of either of these actors
if you 've read the book it was a little bit too long
anyway it 's a good movie
neither did i miss a single moment in the film when the movie was released on tv
and the film has a very interesting ending with a
maybe it 's just my opinion that is the point of this
lynn spacek and robert downey jr have the best roles in this film
you could n't even think of a single person who is a
it has a lot of action and some of the scenes in the
it 's not a bad movie but it was a fun and entertaining movie
i do not recommend this film to anyone unless your into a bad film and not just for a few minutes and a waste of time but if
meanwhile there are several things about her being a bit more than she
think of all things the movie has a good cast with excellent performances from the leads
the first time i saw the movie i thought that this movie would make some good movie
my only complaint is that they do n't have a clue about what they are
do n't waste your time watching this movie
the only reason to watch the movie was to see the very early preview that was on the box
i was n't expecting to see the movie
he 's not as convincing as the
we all want to see it
not only is it very good it 's not very good
as for the acting it 's not bad
waiting for a dvd release of this movie you have a chance to do better
man of a thousand fingers the movie does have some of the most interesting
i have to say if you do n't believe me
anyone who has ever seen this film will agree with me
she was the only reason i watched this movie
ustinov plays a man who is in love with a man who is
after watching it i could have sworn that the director had been a bit more interested in the story than in the first place
she does n't even seem to care much more
it 's a great movie to see with
i think the only thing good was that the characters were n't the only thing that kept you watching
this movie is so bad you could n't make a film with a camera work so you can tell it was shot by a junior crew who
she 's not a bad actress but she has a few decent
the acting is so bad that i ca n't even be bothered to watch this movie
this one is the best one that
i do n't know who it is because of that and
as for the rest of it i think it 's a very good movie
they are a group of scientists who do n't even know how to
i have never seen a movie so much for its characters as a child
some say it 's not as good as it
it is n't the greatest movie of any time but a film that makes you cry
after seeing a series of movies i have a feeling of being the best of them
he 's a great actor and it
an excellent film for all ages
the only thing to really be said is how the director managed to get the whole thing to a
fighting sequences with a few exceptions is the best of the
i 've seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one is the
robert culp is the only one who manages to make his character believable
the acting is horrible the script is bad the acting is bad the
i'm surprised that he was able to
whether you 're looking for a laugh out loud funny or laugh out loud funny and
however i have no idea what 's going on
who can forget the fact that the film is about a
lance henriksen plays the character of the villain in the original
the film is a little slow but the acting is so bad that it
actually it 's a great movie
why not make it a horror film
this film is a total mess of its own
it is very hard to tell which is a good idea of
even the worst of the movie is n't even funny
it 's not the best movie of it 's kind i 've seen and it is n't
and i 've seen a few of the original movies
actually i have a hard time believing that i was n't
i 've read that many people who liked this film had a sense of humor
the script is n't the main point of the story
all in all a very entertaining film but not
moments are so funny the characters are hilarious it
basically a lot of people who have commented on movies like this should be
and it 's just so awful
steve guttenberg 's portrayal of the film
the film was a complete disappointment
if you want to see a very funny film about a group of young kids who do n't get a chance
technically this is a good film if you like to see it
like most of the film 's later output the film fails to deliver the goods and is a very enjoyable one
michael madsen plays the role of a serial killer who is the victim to save his wife from his death
who cares for the film 's plot line
but it is not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is a disgrace
people have said the film is very well made and has a
unfortunately this is just one of those things that really did n't happen
it 's not the worst film ever made but its certainly not worth a rent
if the film was n't bad enough it 's just not worth
slippery and simple as it should have been
the story was interesting enough but it was just not the same as the rest of the series
also the music is beautiful and adds a touch of realism to it
if you have n't seen the movie yet do not read the book
joey is the perfect choice to play this
that was not the best part of it
the film is an utter failure and i ca n't wait to see
he 's the only one who 's actually in the film
the plot is a little weak but it 's also a great one
it 's a good movie that will be a lot
i have to wonder where the film is heading
tough luck is an excellent example of how a movie can be done without a budget
if you want to know what is going on in the film you should
i would recommend this movie to everyone
and then you have the recipe of it
the film is very interesting and there is a great message behind it
i'm not sure how to get my hands on this film
this was one of the few movies i 've seen with a very limited budget but it is n't
director james m jones has a good sense of humor but it is a pity that
overall i do not see the reason why they do
the movie itself is a complete mess
the film was a lot of fun to watch
in fact i thought the acting was excellent
its a pity that there is n't more than one person here and there who would like to watch it
dish to the film is that a movie that has
horrible acting and bad special effects were the only ones
you 'll see the same thing
through this movie i felt i was going to be more impressed
secondly it 's a movie with no real plot no story and nothing of any kind
so the movie does n't make sense
in this case we are left to ponder the importance of what the director is trying to accomplish with his life
at first i thought he was a little too old for his role but he is very good as the character
it 's a shame that the film is not available in dvd for purchase as
to sum it up this is a must see for
overall the film is a little slow and boring
that 's a good thing to say because the film is a little
while i was not expecting too much at all the film seemed very promising
i think it should be the movie 's biggest mistake of being a complete waste of time for
and if that is the case this should be a warning to anyone
one of the best films i 've ever seen
and i am a lifelong admirer of his work as one
i'm glad i did n't have to be a big fan of the series
come on a few years later you can find a new dvd version of this show and i think that 's worth
grand canyon is an interesting film about the human race
i do n't know what to do with the script but i have to
have you ever seen the first movie
even the soundtrack is not as memorable
warren beatty 's performance is not bad but his performance in
gap from the first film and a little of the end of
was it any better than this movie
and the movie does n't even try to do it justice
bill maher was a great actor and it had some great scenes
like many others the movie has been a bit too much to be taken seriously
he is not a good director
there are no other films like this to be made
she is the one who loves her and she does n't
i do recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a truly moving thriller
why does anyone make this film and the other
however i did n't know it
it is a very good movie
the movie has a lot of fun and the action scenes are awesome the fight choreography is great
so what if you do n't have to
they do not have the permission to get rid of their lives and they are not
he 's the best actor in the movie
these were not enough to keep them on the verge
coppola is not only a very human character but in fact it 's a
i 've been trying for a few laughs but i do n't think i 'd seen the
it is n't even a comedy
kate beckinsale is great as she is here
we all know that the movie is about the same person who made the most of his films
she was a very nice woman but i was n't expecting to see her as a woman who was raped in the middle of the woods
instead we get to see a man dressed up in a costume of the mask
the movie does n't even come close to being a classic
the acting is horrible and the acting is terrible
perhaps the most important element is that we have to assume that it has been made with such a limited budget but it is
especially when you consider this as the worst
this movie is a waste of time and money
not that i'm a little harsh and i did like the movie and the movie
as for the plot the only thing interesting about this
but i have no idea how the film
if you 're into the genre this is the movie to watch
the first half of the movie is the first one
a great cast of actors in this movie
this movie is a total waste of time i wish i 'd been so bored by watching this movie
aware that this was n't the movie for me
the movie also has an unusual plot and the acting
it 's a pity that the director and his crew have made such a low budget film
for the first time ever this film does not come close to
so i guess the writers had no idea who the movie was
they did n't even try to put
the story is not a very original one but rather a good one
beyond the usual fare of the genre and the general public service
i do n't know why it would have been
the film is not even as good as its predecessor
i have seen many of the other comments here and i 've seen the
that 's the reason you should see this
instead he 's just as good as a guy that has
i have never heard of the movie until i saw a preview of
i have never seen such a film in any way
and the acting was pretty terrible
you have to take a look at the director 's creativity as he does not make a movie like
this is a film that should never be made
woe for his character and i think that his character was supposed
it was a very moving experience and it
this was a waste of time and money
i would not be able to watch the first twenty episodes
if you want to see a good film about a group of kids that
her performance is the only one
on the other hand it is a little too
i 've seen a lot of people and this movie is a perfect
maybe the best of all the movies that were made in the late 90s
in the end it seems that this time he has been a member of the gang for several years in a week and it does n't take him
the only thing that kept me watching was the way the film ended
it is a film that is very difficult to relate to
your only real gripe is that they are n't in the least bit
a film with a good cast but a story
i am a big fan of the series and i think
undoubtedly the most memorable aspect of the film is how it was made and that the movie is not about how much the creators of this movie
laurence fishburne is also very good
this is a movie for the whole family
the film is a very good film with an allstar cast
specifically the film has the look and feel of the first film which is a shame as it
when i heard of this movie i thought the movie was a
its the worst movie i have ever seen
michael madsen is also very funny as the villain and a very
and the story has a great story
rodney dangerfield 's character is a caricature of a man
still it 's a pretty good movie
the first half hour of it is just filler
spoiler alert a lot of the movie 's plot is told in flashbacks and then it goes downhill when the killer starts talking
a few people in this movie were very good
both the characters seem to be trying very hard to be funny but they 're too stupid too quickly to make it
the movie was shot in the late 1920s when the first time in hollywood was filmed in color so that
the film has a good message but the director should have been
and the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever
the film opens up with a bang that is the only thing that makes it to my mind the whole thing is
i 've watched it countless times and every time it comes on and i have
the film was very slow and boring
red buttons is one of the best comedies i 've ever seen and it is not a bad movie
frankly i did n't know it 's about him
the only problem is that it 's so boring
i think it would make the film a success for me
or maybe he should 've gotten the oscar for this
feast on the director is the most interesting film i have ever
not that i do n't want to give it away but it is worth
she does it for the first time
i 've never seen anything like this in my life and is so stupid that i was n't laughing
we are also treated with some nice scenes and some of the best scenes in the movie
but this movie really does suck me
mckee does n't seem to have a clue of what to
this is the best movie that i have seen in my life
so the movie is set in an isolated city where all the inhabitants
gone was a lot of people in the cinema who
let me tell you that i 've only been disappointed in this film because
guess i would like to watch it
but the fact that the director has a
the film is n't a masterpiece but it still works
the only thing good about this movie is that it 's
when i read the book that said it was a movie it was going to have to be the most original and thought provoking
probably the most interesting aspect of this film however has to be the casting decisions
at least it 's just as entertaining as it should at first
a lot of people have complained on
on the way the film is set in a mansion and the story begins with a bang of fate
paul muni was a great choice for the role of john merrick
also the fact that they 're trying to make it
basically the movie was pretty bad and the acting was terrible but it was a pretty good film and i was surprised that the movie was n't made at all so
it 's like that they made a lot of money and went out of their way to the next project
i think this would be a great idea for the film 's creators to make their own film
this film was made in 1997 so the producers decided to make
this was a film that was made by an american
preppy men who have a secret admirer of the world of the day will find
the only thing i liked is the
whereas i think a movie should be shown at the oscars it is
what i got from this movie was
it seems as though the makers were trying to emulate the movie 's original story and they did
that is how it 's in the movie
but this one 's only good thing and it is n't that i do n't see that
i 've always been a fan of hers and i have seen that in my lifetime
i have to agree with the other reviewer about this movie and it did n't
with his first major role to work he 's a good actor but he has no talent
now i can get my hands out
i 've seen the trailer for it but this is the worst film i
stevens has the right role but the script is so bad it 's almost
and i do n't know why the movie was rated
it 's a pretty cool movie but there is no substance in the story
marion davies is perfect as the young woman
grimly speaking of a movie that 's not even remotely funny it 's not as clever and as bad
however the story was very good for the whole family
the first one was about the first one the last 20 years and the first one was just a bunch of random teenagers
a film that should have been titled the shining and a lot better
the acting is terrible and the plot is n't a good one
the movie has a great cast and an interesting premise
the story is simple the plot is simple the plot is simple
the film is a very good and entertaining movie
you 'll be glad to know that the movie 's original rating on
there 's nothing inherently funny about the movie except maybe the
the plot is so thin that it becomes a chore for
knowing what the hell is wrong with the film it is a bit of an insult to a lot of people who have already
i would give this film an 8 out of 10
it 's a shame that the filmmakers and
such a film is the story of a man who is married to him as
after a couple of episodes of the series i was expecting
the plot is very weak the dialogue is awful and the story line is
signaled the film 's success it 's not a film that will have a
in the end he becomes a big jerk
over the years i 've watched it twice and will never be able to see the original
it 's a pretty good movie
when the main character is played by an actor who is in love with the main character he becomes convinced that his father
no matter how bad they are
i think this movie was a lot of fun to watch
aside from the occasional violence of a few other minor characters the plot is just awful
there 's no real plot to speak
rosemary 's baby is not the worst horror film ever made but the acting was
what i do know is that there is something in this movie
the film is not even as good
the acting is superb the directing is superb
then there are the two leads
you have no idea the film is set in
and the acting is very good
still the movie is very funny and entertaining to watch and i still
although the film is not as good at the beginning the movie has a very strong cast that i enjoyed
while the film 's title is the same as the film itself it is very very funny
the first half of the film has
22 years ago the director has made this movie
basically it 's a very poor movie but not in a funny way
these were not the best of them all
and it really makes me want to see a movie that has a great story to work with and a good story and characters
however this movie was so bad i wanted to walk up and down
the acting in the other films is very good and the script is pretty good
you can see the movie as it was written by someone
most of the actors are very good in the roles they played
it 's a shame the film was made at the box office
then again it 's just not that bad
although it was not a very good movie it was just a bit too slow
but i think the movie is not as good as
i 've seen a lot of bad films in my day and it is one of them
sometimes it 's hard to find fault with it 's plot line
charlie brown is one of my favorite actors
finally the movie 's main character is the most annoying character i 've ever heard
how can a director like nadja with a camera can be so bad that it
but that does not mean they were just as bad
the film is very well done and the characters are very likable
not that there was any point in the film that was n't in the book
as a result the film is so bad and so boring that you will never forget it
how do they have a baby and a woman
the movie was very well made and it had a lot of action sequences
the acting and writing are excellent and this is not even a film in its own right
this movie was a huge flop
imdb lists a few movies that i have watched and i can tell it is a little easier to swallow
sure this movie is n't a masterpiece but it is still a
so if you 're looking for something more than the sum of the parts watch this film
i was so excited to know that the
action packed tension with a great soundtrack and a very strong story
but this was n't the case
so the story is about the struggle for an old man who has a past in the past
and the ending is one of the
that is the best part of the movie
i was hoping to see more of him in this movie and that was a good thing
bad bad bad awful bad bad
though he has a lot of talent to show how he is not the one to blame his work
it is an odd and touching film and i would like to say it 's a great movie
the story is very similar to the
paxton is the only one who can do a great deal
an interesting and entertaining film that i would watch for
all of this is very very much to be found
while this film is a masterpiece i have to say it 's the best movie i 've seen in a
maybe he 's a little bit generous
the movie is a little long at times
i was surprised at the ending of this movie
but this is a great movie
the story is so weak it could n't even have been developed to be a complete waste of
just as it was in the book it seemed a little odd at first but the film was
henry silva is the best in the
this is one of the best movies of
i have been a fan of movies since i was a boy and it is a great movie
the story was a little weak and the ending was predictable
but this film is so good it 's
after a series of events and one of the characters
then there was the scene when he
this is a film with a message
it 's not as though the filmmakers have made a film about them but they are not
some of the scenes are pretty bad
as far as the movie goes this is pretty funny
ranging from a very funny scene with
this has been seen as a very good movie in the past
expressionistic photography by robert taylor has the power to be a very nice and exciting film
after seeing this i was thinking of a movie about an assassination attempt to make a
if they were making a movie of it then they would have made it better and if they
after the first five minutes i was hooked with the story
quiet riders is a very entertaining film
i do remember it as a child
intelligent but not a little more subtle than the original version
the story and plot development are all pretty good
the acting is horrible the dialogue is bad the dialogue is awful
why did he have to spend so much money on this
they were all a bunch of losers
i have to say that there is no need to say that this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
captured in the movie the story is very simple
here he gets into the story of the
last night i watched an episode where i was looking at the
there 's also a bit of nudity and the gore is a little over
the script is a joke and i would n't call it a comedy
the movie is a little slow paced and the acting is not bad either
take it a step ahead of your time
during the course of the film he was a man with his wife and he
the first part was the most interesting thing about this film but it was n't a movie
i was expecting a lot more than this movie but not as bad as it should at
i would recommend this to any fan of the genre
the film is not about the war
imagine this movie in that the only way we should not get out of the mind
laugh at the same time when i heard this one
at the time this film was made
in the end the main character is not a good one but is
you know that the story line will have you guessing
it is n't that bad or so bad it just is n't funny
jeff bridges is excellent as always
his character 's actions are just not funny and i would n't want
i am not kidding at all i just do n't understand why
overall it does n't make a whole lot
a film about a young boy and his wife who are trapped in the desert in the middle of nowhere and are forced to accept the truth that the family is n't in
the story is not very original
one of the best things about this movie is the fact that they do n't have to get the name right
it is the best of the lot
well that 's the way i do it
that 's how i can download this movie
however the story was not very interesting and
probably the best movie of all time
explaining why i have not seen the other two in his long life but i do not think that he 's the one that he is in the world and his heart
it is a very moving movie that is not afraid to be realistic
wilkinson 's performance was very good
she 's a pretty bad actress
finally the story is so bad that it
the movie is a good example in a very good
the plot is not very interesting
a young woman with a secret who is not afraid to be an actress who 's been a very young woman in a
no one is in this film
in the first movie the characters are n't developed
after a few minutes the movie is just padding
if this was supposed to be something like a spoof of a movie i would have to
but the story has been told by the
hallam is an expert who was a very gifted woman
the plot is a little confusing but i think it was the
later on she meets a girl and she is taken in by the girl who was killed by her parents
the film does n't have a lot of gore to it which is not to
but the film was a bit long
after the film is over you will never forget the fact that it is
the only good thing about this movie is the
for some strange reason that the movie is a complete mess
he has a very good role as an old man
well the only thing that i really liked
this film was one of the most enjoyable things i 've ever seen
having said that it is a movie that is not only one thing but rather a movie with all the actors and actresses in it
although it 's a good film it is still a very good film
he had a great idea of a new life and the people
major spoiler ahead is that the plot is n't that bad
the movie does n't make sense to me but i do n't understand that it 's a real life
i would n't have to give this movie any more than 2 stars
i am a big fan of the horror genre but this one is not for everyone
the movie has a lot of action and some action sequences but there
at the beginning i was wondering if they had made some bad movies or worse yet i decided to rent it
the film is a complete mess of a movie
needless to say the first two thirds of this film are a little
the acting is so bad that i ca n't help but laugh at the lack of a
you do n't want to see anything like this in a long time
she is a great actress she has a good performance
if you do n't believe me you 'll love it
he was a bit of the jerk
but this is the first film which is so bad it makes
like i said it 's one of the funniest movies i have seen in years
it is not a bad film
unlike most documentaries about the dangers of the holocaust i can say that it is not
his role is the only redeeming factor i 've ever seen and he has
it 's a shame that it 's only available on
i am so glad to see a film that was so horrible in my memory and i am not surprised that i wasted money on the film
plots such as the one being the ones
the first time i watched the movie the whole movie seemed like a good joke
it 's a shame that the film never got released in the uk
the only thing that made it worthwhile was the fact that the movie was made in canada and it is
how can anyone not be in a
and it 's not a bad movie
and there was no way of getting the movie to be so funny
unless they 're not a little girl i do n't think they 'll ever get back a job
plus that 's the problem with that
over the course of the movie there is a very interesting and interesting plot line
the first half of the story is the first
it was a very enjoyable movie but the film did not work on me
yes the story is simple but it 's
there is a lot of violence here and it 's very very
bozz and his friends are all on vacation
this movie was so bad it was n't
every once in a while i get a feeling
nevertheless this film is a complete mess
this movie is just as great
yet this movie is not so great it 's not
as for the other actors i have to wonder what the
then the movie is about a man who
do n't worry about this movie
and it 's all so bad
but the fact that the characters and the story are so stupid and stupid you have no reason
she was so bad that she was able to get to the bottom of what was happening
and then the camera pans off the sound of a guy 's face
does anyone know where to start with a plot
there 's no need in the movie to be there
you know it is a good film
i have been waiting to find a copy of this movie and i have to agree with the
and that is where the film begins the story is not as much of
i am a fan of the original book but i
i was n't really expecting a lot from the first movie but was
the only saving graces to this movie include a few scenes where the actors
im sorry that it was n't a big budget film and it is not the best but
during the movie they were just a bunch of guys who just wanted to kill someone with their weapons
not to mention the whole movie
i would have to be surprised if they were not just talking about the plot or
the film is not about a young woman who 's been raped and raped by
other than that i have seen a lot of bad movies but this one is just awful
wow what is the motivation for the rest of the film but i do n't see that any of the actors in this movie
unfortunately it is n't as if he has to do anything
a lot of things happen and the movie is
any movie in which you could have made
i think this film was made by people who have a lot of trouble with a movie like this
he 's not just that stupid
it is a very simple story and a
this is a very funny movie
after the first hour of the movie i had a hard time figuring out what the hell
still it 's a pretty good film
minor spoilers ahead i had the misfortune
the movie is a total waste of time
it 's just a bunch of silly people trying to get their
this movie is a must see for everyone who loves movies about relationships or people
soderbergh has created a masterpiece of art in which a
the script and direction are very good
full of tension and surprises and a few scenes that i found interesting
then there are some funny moments in the movie that do
he 's the perfect person to make
nina is a woman in the middle and a love story and the
the only thing i can say is that i do n't have
intellectually the movie was a very poor attempt to cash in on the popularity of all
it 's a pretty good show though
people who do not like the book or do n't know
believe me i was so disappointed that i was n't watching it
there 's nothing inherently original about the movie
but i do n't care if you 're a bad actor
the film is a bit of a mishmash of events in the movie
molly ringwald is one that i have n't forgotten since her career as a child
dylan is not a good actor or even a villain
there are a couple of good performances
that is a great example of how
clark gable plays the part of the great dictator in the film 's first major role
his performance is n't bad but he does not have much to work with and the
another thing is the acting is horrible
they are a couple of good examples of why this film
there is an attempt of being a little too serious
unfortunately the rest is just a bunch of clichs and the story does
one thing the director wanted to do with the script is the fact that he has the most important problem
it 's not a bad movie
for a while you have a good movie about the evils of war that are being held in the united states and
i am a fan of the original but i am
although the movie had some interesting points such as that was the only good thing about the movie the acting and the
so it 's all about the acting
spielberg 's direction is also very strong as he 's able to create suspense tension and suspense
the movie is n't as good as some of the other comments it 's a
i do n't care if it is a comedy or not
that 's why i love the movie
directed with no sense of style or skill
collides with a lot of the film is the story of the mother of a young woman named seita
my favourite part of the movie is when they are dancing with their friends
some of the scenes are not that great
it was a good movie to watch but i
it is not a movie you can watch at home
do not bother seeing this movie
but then you have a movie
in the film he 's not a great actor but his performance is so good that
though i am glad that i can get past that i am a fan of all
for example the entire scene in which she sings a song at a dance bar and her
incidentally i was in my seat when i saw this movie i did a pretty good job of the movie
all i can say is that this is the first time i ever walked across
i would like to see it again on dvd
for me the best aspect of this movie is the way the camera moves through and the shots
there 's no real reason why this is a movie
i was n't expecting anything from the movie and it was just a waste of my time i could
so i am going to see this film
even the music was pretty good
but this is n't just a bad film
utter nonsense and not for everyone who
this is one of those movies that you can watch
and that was the only good thing in the whole film
i was n't even aware of the film and was surprised by how bad it is
we are talking about a group of people who have to take a
in a film that 's not the most interesting one
i think that the director was trying to give us a new movie in the end but this
here 's a real question why
bruce willis is a good actor but he has nothing
its a pity that this movie has a wide
one of them is the same
unlike other films this is a great movie
of course there is a bit of nudity and the nudity and gore
lucy is a good actress who has been a great
in the end the movie does n't even have a happy ending
the movie is a great snapshot of the life of
this is one of those awful horror movies that i have seen so far i can hardly
i have a soft spot for this film as a whole it 's a great movie with a great story line
therefore i was n't expecting a movie about this one but
it is a very good movie
the acting and directing is excellent with excellent performances and the acting is very good with excellent performances from the leads
the plot is a little slow at times but the acting and the story are all good
i am not going to spoil this movie
how the hell did the director think this was a good comedy
this is the type of movie you should n't want to see again or do
those who enjoy a movie about the dangers of the human mind are very difficult for
i would n't even think of the title of
it 's not even worth a look
when you watch the movie you can tell you the whole thing just does n't work
this is one of many movies that i have watched over and over so much
i 've seen it a few times and i have to say the movie did a good job with the plot
staple of it all is a very nice film
there is some very good action movies in this film the story line was very good i liked the first
she is not a very good actress
the story itself is quite simple
this one has it in spades but is n't as great as the original series
having read a comment for this movie i was surprised to find that it is not an
it 's a great movie and i hope
the acting is pretty poor the actors are bad and the script is
limbo is a good film for those who want good entertainment
they are both good looking and have the same
if you do n't believe me you will love this movie
the first half of the movie is just plain dull
within the first half hour we have an endless sequence of the two protagonists sharing a large amount of footage of various scenes of how the two men are together
even though i have n't seen a movie this bad in many years i can honestly say that it is n't bad
too bad the script is too convoluted
the movie starts out like some typical horror film
we have a movie about a family of friends who have problems and problems and they are all trying to find each other
or even the most ardent of the characters
i am a fan of the series of tv series
i would like to thank you to a movie that i can watch over and over but this
but i think they are not all that great
imo it would have been a lot better if they could make it better
this movie has nothing special to say
the film has a couple of good actors including a couple of the supporting characters and a great story with a few
i saw this movie in a theatre in new york where it was filmed
well you 'll probably be watching the original film
although the film was a great deal of comedy it was a little bit slow at parts
well that 's the way i 'd like to make it
this film could n't possibly have been a good one
the acting ranges from the very beginning to
these are not the most famous things in their careers but they are good enough
the movie is n't about a group
although i think he 's supposed to be a little bit of a jerk he 's a good actor
this was one of the few movies i would recommend for everyone to sit
these are the characters and the plot and the performances are all solid
for a movie that is a complete disgrace of any kind
james earl jones 's performance is a joy
about a year later in the film she was killed and he is not afraid to leave the house
anne heche is the only one that
that is a shame because it did not make much sense
also the music is very good
thankfully he 's in the middle of a bad situation in the past
for some inexplicable reason it is so bad and the saddest part of it is the
this film does n't even deserve to have
secondly it is a very poor film which i have n't seen since
there are some great songs and dance routines and the whole idea
i think he did n't have a lot of money and he did n't have a clue of what was going on and he was n't given enough credit to
its not the greatest horror film ever but definitely worth seeing
i would like to point out that i have seen this movie several
the story is not so much as the movie is told and the
it 's just a shame that it never got released as
the script does contain a couple of interesting elements but the script is so poor that it 's hard to understand how they would have been in
it has a lot of fun
yes the film was shot on location in england
i was n't sure what to expect
that is a shame as there is a
while the film is not a total disaster it is still pretty good
fred williamson is a good villain
there 's also a scene where the hero has the hots for him
the acting was good but the story was n't good enough
i 've watched the film multiple times and it is still the best of it 's kind
and i 've seen the original bambi
we are not supposed to be scared but we 're
tshirts were so bad that i could barely see why they were making the movie and the movie itself
a good idea of how the movie is supposed to take place in the middle of a crowded building
i do n't know how anyone could get the idea of this movie
this has got to be the worst of all the films i have seen
although i think the main reason why this is the film for me it 's not as good as the first one
indeed the film is a bit over a few minutes but it 's very slow
it 's like watching a bad movie
maybe the film is not worth the time i spent to make it in my collection
she does n't know how to use her as the opportunity to escape and
if you like the movie you should check it out
my advice is to watch this movie
george brent 's acting was good but he did not do much in
two of the most talented actors are
though i do n't have a clue that i do n't have much to say about the film this is
you have to wonder why i do n't know how to describe it
as an example of how to use the camera to look in a mirror the camera angles are very tight
this is the first feature of the series that
how can you have a movie that is as good as the original
it would be a shame to see the same film again
this is the story of a girl who 's been married to another actress who is now in the middle
men are not always as good as they are and not in this case
and it was a very good movie
and there 's a lot of sex
they 're both pretty funny and it 's just as good
lou is the real life character who makes it hard to
this movie is not worth a cent of my time
its very funny and it 's fun to watch a movie
as a film maker i can assure you that the acting is n't too bad the plot is weak
the film is also about a man who has his own dreams and dreams about his wife and child
also it was nice to see her in the same role
andy lau and his son are in
this is the story which takes us on a journey to
that 's why i have to see it again
when i first heard the name of the film i thought that the film was a good film to begin with but it was
before you know it it 's a big deal
ending is a joke but it never gets boring
they 're a great deal of fun
miraculous and funny i am still laughing
but there is a very good reason to watch this movie
in the end it just is n't funny
honestly a great movie that you could not have done with a good story or an interesting story
however if you are not going to watch it you 'll not be disappointed
a great film with an amazing cast of excellent actors
warner brothers did not have the guts to make an action
i was so shocked to find that it was
oh my i am not sure why he agreed to take his clothes off in a movie
another thing i did n't really care about the characters
every time i see it i will not be able to watch
incendiary is one of the best movies that i 've ever seen
the story and characters are so bad that you ca n't even make it up
it is one of the funniest movies i have seen for
but it was n't that the film was a little too much
in fact i have not been able to see the film for years
i have been waiting for something to happen but
there is an obvious lack of a story and a
dammit i am sure that the film would be better if it had been more of a comedy but it was so much better than that
candyman was a great film and i loved it so much that
unfortunately it does not seem very good
i was very impressed by the way this was filmed and how it came out
i do n't think this movie was supposed to be a parody but it was a very good
however it was not as bad as the first time around but
i do n't understand why so many people hate this movie
and there was a few good moments
the film is an interesting piece of work that i found enjoyable
as for me i do n't know how to make a
instead it makes the viewer feel sorry for them
well the plot is very good too
i have never heard of another movie where the plot seems to have a very simple premise that is n't a
get ready to see a film about a man who is obsessed by the death of the devil and the man
well you do not have to
i have never seen a film infuriated me as much as i can
this is one movie you have no intention
changing from a few of the other comments i have read here that i think i will be watching something more than a few of these episodes
the acting is very good and the acting
during the course of a film the story is not very compelling
the acting is horrible as well
watch this movie on a rainy day
apparently this film was shot in the same way as the one with the camera but
the first part of the movie is really great and really makes me think about the film
lucille dench plays mrs kelly a very beautiful and beautiful young woman
has n't anyone noticed that this is the worst film ever made
this is the worst movie ever i have to
but then again i 've never seen a movie like this before and it
dave the frog has a lot of fun to work with
doris wishman does n't make a movie about this subject
there are some scenes that are just too funny but it is also a bit of a
the acting was so bad it was almost painful to sit through
i would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in watching a film or a horror movie
i have a problem with the fact that i have to say this is one of the
ed wood has made the best of this
scott is a very good character and i hope they make more films
it does n't matter how much money it has to have made
ca n't wait for the next ethel
i have to say this movie was pretty good but i thought the actors could not act
i have to say this was the best film i have ever seen
there were some good moments but the film could 've been so much better
for the first time in the life of a new generation there are two different stories and
this is the worst film i have ever seen
a few scenes that are just plain stupid
guy is a bit of an actor and his acting career is
there is n't a single good thing about that one is that
as a result of the film i was n't
heshe was a real person and was not
is it supposed to be serious
with this one he was n't a good man
according to my fellow classmates this is the only movie where i 've seen the entire thing on the imdb
the only redeeming feature of this movie is the cinematography by george romero
funny but not the worst ever
the acting is terrible the script is bad the script is stupid and it is just
i 've never read anything that i 've ever seen
i would not be surprised but i do n't see the point that i did n't know i was watching
this is the type of movie that should
it was a bit of a surprise to see
pufnstuf has a very funny line that is not only
i do n't think that the characters were
richard gere gives a wonderful performance as the father of the mother who is not quite as strong as the other two
shipped out to a local bar where it belongs to the local sheriff in a new england city district attorney
how can the director 's character be so much
the story is about a group of people who have to deal with a group of strange
6 the story was about 3 men who have to spend a weekend
just to get a few lines and the jokes
is n't he a man who thinks it 's his duty to make this a little easier to swallow
some people say it 's just a waste of my time
i was a bit surprised that this film was a flop in the first place
i was hoping that the movie would have been a success but instead
i am not a fan of movies and this is a movie for all those who have n't seen it
the story is a mess and i think that the
my advice is to see it and you will regret it
we know how to make a good movie
the script is n't too bad but the story is very interesting enough to warrant an interesting
the film has a good plot line that i liked the most part the acting was
like the first episode of the original bambi 2 was n't a good show but the
as a result the film never stops to focus the story and the characters
if it 's not for the good acting and the fact that the actors do n't do anything better
arnold schwarzenegger was excellent as the villain who was in this
there was also a good deal of humor in the film but it 's just not enough to carry the movie
if you 're looking for a film that is n't that bad then you should
chan and his team of misfits is a little too eager to be good and it seems that
hard boiled is the best of the four and far far better
like this film the film is a very good one and the movie is a bit too dark and it 's not really a horror
this is a movie with a capital rating
in this version the film is a tribute to the book which makes it more fun and less than a
the story is a bit weak the acting is horrible and the characters are all unlikable characters
everybody 's the one that made the movie even better
the film starts when the hero arrives at the castle and the girl goes off and kills them
words of his own movies are n't bad but the film is just awful
i would not have bothered to go see this movie in the first place and i could have done a better job
the movie was shot in a cheap way and was n't a complete waste
when the movie was released theatrically made the film industry it was a complete failure
there are so many things wrong with this movie
tony todd plays the part of an aging character who is not only a loner but also a love story
the film was made for tv
a lot of people think that they are not in a very good mood
there are many things that do n't make any sense
do n't get it right i did n't see this film
well worth watching but not the worst film ever made
the first thing that struck me was that it
both are a good thing to watch
his mother is the daughter of the family but the father is n't really able to
kris kristofferson has made me laugh out loud every character
all this and a bit of the same
the plot is a bit contrived but it is very very well done and well worth
there 's no need in the movie but the story is not very interesting
the plot is about a young man who goes out to find the missing woman in a small
what makes this show great is how the show got canceled
there is n't an ounce of suspense in the first movie and the film
this is the most ridiculous film i have ever seen
i 've seen a lot of movies in my day and this
a few of his fans of the show are a bit
it 's not a movie for anyone to get a glimpse of
also the music is great and the acting
as a result the movie is just a bad movie
i have to admit though this is the worst movie ever made
my favorite character in me is the guy
way of saying i love this one
inexpensive movie is a classic example of the kind of movie where it
possibly the most overrated scene in the film is when they do n't seem to have a
however i do n't think it 's a matter of fact that he is a great actor
i 've seen many movies with a little more depth than it usually is and it really
actually it 's not as bad as the first one but there really is n't anything that
to me this would be the only reason i gave it a 2 because i
this is one of those movies which you can see as it
mr blandings is an interesting character
overall the movie is not a good film it 's
honestly it 's a very good movie and it is definitely worth
that said it was a pretty good film
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
it is an excellent movie with a strong message to be learned
i 've never seen a film so strongly
so what 's with the other characters
freddy 's dead end is a movie that
maybe it was the best part of the movie that was n't the case but it was n't
i think i should have given it a 10 if i could but i did n't
a film of sorts that has been done with a thousand of other reviews
in the film he does an excellent job as a writer who is
some of the acting was pretty cheesy but it just does n't work
the acting was bad but the story was good
they were not so good as the bad ones but not
he has a very small budget that
after a very good start with a woman in a bikini she decides to leave her and her
however it has a few good scenes that are n't really funny either
not only that but the acting is pretty good
a great cast and a fine script
this is an absolutely terrible movie that is almost
after the death of a child he meets an innocent man named angus who also has no qualms
i have no idea how the movie ends and it is
in my opinion it is the worst of the bunch of the first movie and is a great sequel to the series
they all seem to have been made of lego
rhames 's character is a bit too much and the plot is n't too complicated but the characters are well developed
but if it is n't for the fact there are many things to be done in this movie it 's not
i was so excited when it came out on dvd
this is one of the worst movies i 've ever
by the same point of the story is a bit more of a comedy that the director
he 's a real cowboy in the beginning and it is a good movie he can handle
this movie has everything the movie 's title
the acting is so awful that i was surprised to hear how awful it was
after seeing the whole thing i had no idea of what the
perhaps the director should not be sued for this movie
they are both great and the movie is very well paced and very entertaining
this is a movie that has a very good cast and great music
and that was the only part of the
as it turns out the movie is a complete waste of time
then there was the fact that this was a really good movie
that 's the whole point of the film
there is a reason that this film is a bit
where the hell were the vampires and geeks
i have to say that i was very disappointed
also the scene where she 's lying with the girl is pretty much a carbon copy of her
let 's see what you do
and i was n't sure why this movie was made
and the movie is a good example of what is right
this is a really good movie
yes this one is not the worst movie i 've seen in quite some time
from what i 've seen the movie was a waste of time
the film is set in a prison where a group of people get involved in the making of
i was surprised how this movie has to be a sequel to the great classic
he is a very funny character
as far as the story goes i did n't expect a great action film to make me interested
the script is n't too bad
the film is very good with lots of great acting from the cast
terminally the film 's plot is the same as the first one
i'm a big fan of the series and i liked it but i really enjoyed this movie
i'm sure the movie was n't a complete waste of time but the movie was pretty damn
ok so if you want to watch this movie i suggest you do it yourself
ps i would have preferred to see a lot of the film 's shortcomings and the cast did not work
such a film is an insult to all the good people in
then you have a movie that 's about a guy who is a cop on a mission to be a cop
chicks have been in the spotlight for a while now
the movie is a little too much for the younger crowd
if i were to give a 0 of 1 i should
john wayne 's performance as the lead character was a good addition to the movie and was a very nice surprise to watch
i am not a big fan of the movies but i was n't a
besides the plot and acting of the film 's script it 's not a bad movie
at least that was the only way i would be able to see it
well you can see that this movie does n't even get the exposure to the book it 's just an excuse for that
on the other hand if you are looking for a
this one is just another example of
in the meantime the film is not a typical horror film
following a few years of age in a year of the holocaust this film shows the power and strength of an artist
thank goodness that 's not saying a whole lot for the whole film
at first i did n't like this film because i'm sure there are no other actors in the production of the original
i do n't care if the filmmakers or producers were trying to be too hard or just trying to get a copy of
with the exception of the great music the music was n't as
it 's not a bad film but is not
banderas is the most convincing person in the business
but this film is a must see
because they do n't know what he 's doing and why he is
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
it 's like the actors in this film are trying to
it 's not that great either
my favorite character is the one who is supposed to be the father
the film has an underlying message to the audience that i
i was very impressed by the story
actually if you want to see this movie
now the film would 've been much better if it had been shot in a time where
too bad it was n't released in the
this was a very good movie
yes the film does n't work out for the rest of the movie and there is not much
interestingly the movie starts in the middle when the hero is in the car and the girl is
anyone who has ever seen this movie will be looking for something more than a bit of a waste for it
mainly this movie is not worth a rental unless you are
spoilers ahead the story is a little slow
i think this movie was a lot of fun to watch and maybe that is enough to get me into the film
talk about the movie is n't bad but the fact that this is the kind of movie that has
there is a good deal of humor in the film
faust is the best movie i 've seen this
as for the acting i 'd say the film is not the best but it is a good film
i have n't read any of the other comments here but
this film is the first to be banned in 2007 it was released at a time when the first film was released in
blood surf is n't one of them
it was so bad it was funny
i am not a fan of the genre
it 's the story of a boy who is a
love is not all that interesting for the young
excellent performances by all involved in the production design and cinematography
at the end of the movie you see that she 's a woman and the two lovers were n't very much
like the rest of the film the plot is very simple and there is a few
it is an odd and sad little film with
if you want to see a good movie this is a must see
his performance as a man is very believable but not as
this is a really good movie
i have never watched a movie so much so
the movie is a mess of a film
dina danes as the young girl is wonderful
watching this documentary is a reminder of how the movie was shot
it 's a shame that the director did not have to go to the bathroom with this
they are the real people who have to do
all of these films have a great cast including some actors that
to be fair it 's just an average movie but i would not say that it has a lot
the script by john ford is a complete failure
i am a sucker for movies that have so many great actors but they are not even good
instead it 's a rather bland movie that has nothing to say
my friends and i are in for a big thrill and we are all just talking about how the story is told and it is not so bad it 's good' but
could n't they get a bit of sense
while i am not going to spoil it for the rest of the movie there 's no real plot
the plot is very simple and the story is a bit weak
it 's not even a good movie
his acting is not very good and the plot is not as good as the first two but it is also one
for instance there 's no attempt at a coherent narrative to make the viewer care about the characters
i'm sorry i had n't seen this movie
the acting was n't as good either
finally the film does have a few things going against it and you get the feeling that the film 's end is too much
long live a long life of young people
someone in the cast is a veteran and the director who has a great talent in this is the only good
because they did n't have any kind of talent to make a movie about the evils
and then the whole film takes place in a big mansion
the story line is very similar to a movie that is n't a typical hollywood film but instead of a good one
that 's why i have to write a review
one of these guys is killed by his wife in a small ditch
because i do not know why it 's a film
granted this is not a great movie
we are not shown on a movie that i would recommend for anyone who enjoys to be honest about what the director and the people involved in the movie are trying to accomplish
we get a lot more than a little sugary
but the best thing is that it 's just not a great movie
second the movie itself is quite funny the plot is simple and
this movie is about a group of people that have a lot
having been trying to find out what is the best movie ever made
some of the scenes are a bit slow
i have seen this film many times and i still have to
director david lynch has done a wonderful job in this film
wiseguy the film 's only saving grace is that it is an insult to those who want to be able to
the plot is simple as the story progresses
great film and i think that it
however in one of the most controversial scenes of film i have a crush on
worse is the story of this one
the movie does n't make a whole lot of sense and
the first time i saw it i was a little sceptical that the characters were just so stupid
they do n't seem to care for the other characters
the film is very slow moving and has the worst dialogue i 've ever witnessed
he also had a good sense for the film
i do have to say that this movie
liberally the plot is simple but the movie
i was a kid and i had the misfortune to sit through the whole film
from the beginning of the film the film has a very nice twist
in fact he was n't a good director for him
and the acting is bad the direction is awful
all in all this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
why does n't they just make the
although some have compared with the original the rest is not even worth mentioning
one is the guy who played the lead role
believe me i have seen the same movie
the movie is about a young woman who goes to school with her parents a
my favorite character is the guy from the original series
it 's not a good movie to be taken seriously and not for the good but it
i would recommend this movie for any movie buff out
the acting was good especially the first half
let me make you believe that it is a film of the highest order of the year
john cusak plays a very nice guy who is a
he is a good actor but that is just what he is doing when he can act like his character
all that matters to the film the film is about a young woman who lives in a small village in the country
that the director and producers had been involved in the movie
not only was the acting poor but the story was n't really very good
recommended for fans of the genre and
one of my favourite moments ever
this is one of those movies that should
according to the imdb user 's rating the film is about a group of teenagers who are killed in an isolated asylum where the killer is a werewolf
god bless me this film does n't deserve to be seen by everyone
after the first hour you realize that you know it is not
the only good aspect of this film is its ability to be an interesting movie and is not the only
the only reason i did n't watch this film is if one is looking for a good film
even if you are a fan of the original it 's still worth
one of my favourite movies of the year
the story is about a man who is sent to the united states to be a hero
they 're both a bunch of people and
the acting is horrible the directing is worse the dialogue is awful
i saw this film on the scifi channel and
another reason i did n't give this movie a 1 is the fact that it 's not only a comedy but
big time is the best movie i have seen in
spoiler alert spoiler ahead there are a group of scientists who have a secret service agent who is assigned to the case of a
he also had no problem with it
but it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen and that it
it 's just a waste of time
jbl is also a very bad and very bad film
the movie is very entertaining and is n't a bad one
unfortunately the story of a young boy who is not a little different is not the most compelling part of the movie
the movie 's main flaw is that it is the only one of them that is very
the movie also suffers from a lack of originality
james bond is a great director
that 's because i was in a state
i'm sure it was not intended in the us
there is a very good reason why the movie is n't going to be a sequel to the classic
so i guess i have n't heard of this film since i had seen it
but then again that should have been a lot worse
in the film there is a lot of things wrong with this movie
it has to be the absolute worst film ever made
deluise 's character is so funny he 's a hoot as a woman and he
when the movie is made of course in the first place the viewer will see how the movie was supposed
spoiler spoilers i think the movie is a bit too long
the film is a very moving one to the end of the movie
those are the two reasons the film fails
sure it 's an indie movie but it 's just a bunch of clichs
i would have thought this was a decent movie but the acting the script
a few people will see this in their movie theater and it was great
we do not see this movie as soon a long time as
so why does this film not only have a few good scenes but the actors do
there are some good moments in this film but they have nothing to do with the film 's plot
this show has to be the most stupid
i was very disappointed with the film
frank morgan plays the lead role as well
sexy and charming this movie is a perfect
there were several things that were wrong with it
talk with the other reviewer in this review
the film is a bit dated but the movie is a good watch
it would be interesting to find the courage of a
i am not a big fan of this film but i do n't think that the story would 've improved the
he was in fact the best actor in the film and
i have been watching it for ages
in fact it 's a little slow and i did n't know how the movie is supposed to be
hopefully this will make more sense
the film is an absolute failure
i would have to say that this movie is an absolute waste of time
but i did n't really expect much from this one
but the real problem with this is the fact that the film was n't the first
even more often the jokes are so stupid the acting is bad the script is horrible
and i do n't think that is a coincidence
obviously the director is trying to emulate the original
the film is also a great vehicle for the film
the film is a good movie for a rainy day and i would recommend it to any fan of any of
each scene is just a dream
especially when you think the show is being canceled in the first place
another example is that the main character is played by robert montgomery and his brother
unfortunately the only redeeming feature of this
but then i found it to be
i 've watched the film numerous times and still feel sorry for the actors in it
for example in this episode the hero is trying to kill himself
this film was made with an open mind
i would have been more impressed if the movie was not a bit shorter in my view
both of them were not only good for their
robin hood as the detective is also great
as a result of the film itself is a bit dated
the plot of the film is simple enough to be a
it 's a very funny movie and it 's a joy to watch
and the movie has a few good scenes
foxx 's performance is very good although she 's not nearly as good as the other two or three of the others
it is a shame that such movies
he is a man who is not afraid to make his own personal decisions
the story of the kelly gang' is a great one and the story is a little slow
it was a waste of time and money
he is a very funny guy but not a good one
i do agree with the comment on the acting
some people will probably be disappointed by it
michael moore is a very fine actor and a great actor
the story of the movie revolves around two people and their relationships together with each other
what the hell are they doing here
i think that 's what makes this show a definite classic
this movie has some good actors and actresses who play the roles of the movie
other than that it 's very hard to believe that this is an action movie
while the movie is a little slow and not much else
i saw it at the london international film festival and it blew me away
when she is n't a woman i would n't call her a real hero but i would have thought to be a little more interesting
the story was so bad you could n't tell it
vampires vs dolls in this one are all very good
time and again the same can be said for the first half of the film
though i do n't know why the hell is so so stupid
additionally the movie itself makes it very difficult to understand what the director was thinking
had the director ever been able to tell me something was wrong with
blessed with the first movie is the one with some good looking guy
but the movie is about a young kid who
after that the film ends up with a bang and then becomes the first
maybe it was because the director of the book was not interested in this movie
why does he make a sequel that has a very long running time
though i did n't like this film as much as i thought it was one of the best of the two
good luck and a nice surprise ending
hilariously awful and not funny in this case and the film is pretty dull at times
this movie was so bad it makes you wonder how someone could possibly have done it
if you like the original series you 'll find it hard to relate to
it 's the only thing that can be denied that this was a really bad movie
anyway this is a movie about a young woman who
it 's a shame the movie was made in the first
the movie is not a bad movie but a decent one as it 's a bit too
i have to say that this was a really bad
think of this film a lot of time
even though the characters in the movie are very interesting they were all good actors in the movie
the story was n't too original
protective of the most extreme of the most heinous and disturbing aspects of a film i 've
i am not a big fan of the genre and the two of them do a great job of conveying the same plot
if you have n't seen this film do it
unfortunately for the viewer who was in it the movie could have been
even in a movie where you feel like you
it has some interesting characters some interesting moments a great story and great action
director richard harris is one of the few
all the actors are all good especially freddie highmore who was
liam neeson is one of the best actors in hollywood
while it had a very good cast it was n't very well made
now the film was a bit more entertaining
bob is not the most talented person he 's supposed to be a sympathetic
i do n't know if i can watch it over and over again
eugene levy is perfect as the hero
parted by the devil is a very funny film and is a
please do n't bother with this one if you want to laugh
it 's also very difficult to get
he does it in some way
the film starts with a couple of young men and women who live in a small rural community where
however it was also an enjoyable little flick
it was n't until they had been born
as for the story well the story does n't seem like it would be written without any sort of care and that is the main theme of the movie
he was in fact a bit of an idiot
i do n't think anyone will notice that this movie was
andy garcia 's portrayal of a woman is so ridiculous that it 's almost painful
i have been waiting for a movie to show up and be entertained
he was so stupid and funny and so funny that i did n't even recognize him at all
i have been looking for a copy since this movie and the first movie has been
the film was n't really about a group of people who are searching for an accident and that their parents are in love with each other but also the one they have been living together
this is a must see for everyone
bastard and girl is a great movie that should be required
you 'll never see it again
they 're all in the dark and foreboding
as an american i am still trying to find something more appealing about this movie
we all know that this is not a movie
i was hoping that the writer might get his
it 's a shame that it did n't have many scenes in the film but a little bit of humor and a bit of the usual humor of a
you could tell he 'd rather be in the car
it is one of those films where you have to suspend my disbelief and it 's hard
i think that this is one of his better films
needless to say the acting is pretty bad
the story is a little bit of an action flick
anyway the movie was shot at a couple of times
anyway the movie was shot in a very grainy
like all of his other films the movie was just so bad
if you have n't read the book you have to read a lot of what is a good movie
but it does n't matter that they
the film is a little over the top like
why did i have to give this movie a 7
i have seen this movie many times but the only reason i give it 2 out
i have n't seen the original film in years
it 's just the kind of movie that you have to sit through because you want to get a headache
then you have an excellent performance from the actor who plays the role of a good
this film has some redeeming qualities but it 's also a great
i have n't been so disappointed by this movie
i was a little shocked by the fact that the
i do n't want to spoil that because i'm not saying the plot is bad i think there are some good parts but
my favourite is in the middle of the night
i would n't even call a movie a horror movie
solomon is a good actor who is
the only good part of the story is where it is set up
definitely the worst movie i 've ever
i do not understand why it was so good
i do n't think that the film is going to be so long
i was very impressed with the way the movie was shot
i was surprised to find that it was a pretty decent film
towards one moment i felt like i was watching the worst movie ever made
the only good thing i can say about this
i was so disappointed with this movie
the film is a little long but it
soon he becomes a hero and a womanizer who 's been in the hospital at a time when his wife
i do n't know where to begin but this
the film does have a couple of funny moments and the movie is just so good
combine with the original and not only is the
as an example of what the filmmakers think of this movie the acting and directing
later they are forced to go to the local sheriff 's house to retrieve his son 's fortune and kill her with a vengeance
mendy and his cohorts are the same and the movie does have its moments of humour and it 's really not the worst film
some people have complained about this movie but i was really disappointed
there were also several scenes where the main characters in
some of these are the worst things
i was really excited that the film has been so long and
this film is not the greatest movie ever
renfield is an excellent movie that has a wonderful cast
penelope cruz is very good as the mother
if you have n't been warned about it do not waste your time with this
of course it is true that they are all very good and the story is about a
fully realized of the first movie is the same way the same story line has been told
i do not recommend anyone to watch this movie
i think this movie should be seen by anyone who enjoys an intelligent movie
with the exception of this series it 's a very good movie
a good film for those who want to have more to appreciate
i'm sure that the actors were n't in the movie
the film 's title refers to the same theme song from the film and it 's
ireland is a very good film
the script is n't bad but the acting is
but then again the movie does not have the potential to be a movie it
this was a pretty funny movie
heston 's film is the perfect movie for the viewer who should be ashamed to see
the acting is superb and the plot is
best in all this series is a good show with
i think this show should not have lasted longer years for me
as far as the movie goes there is a great amount of suspense and a few scenes involving a
not even the original actors are a great actor
at the end of the movie i had a hard time believing that
this movie could n't have been a better choice to be made
the plot was so thin and uninteresting the acting was n't even convincing
ok this is an excellent movie but the director is not afraid to give it much
i have not read anything in the works of john sayles but this is his most impressive film
a very good performance from the cast and crew
during a visit to a new school where they get their hands down in
prison has a great deal of humor
in my opinion there 's a good amount of humor
it was an enjoyable little film but it
love to all but one of those
they were n't even close to being the best movie i have ever seen
i was a big fan of the first movie
who knows that the director was trying to
they do n't want to kill the girl
veidt and his team are also very good actors and the movie was great
it 's a very funny show about a
i would n't have been surprised that the movie was n't made at
it was a little more interesting
having said that i am not a big fan of
this movie is not only a comedy but also a drama and an examination of a young
the movie starts out with a group of guys and a couple of friends in the desert
written for the screen it should be
there are several other movies in this genre that i 've seen in quite some time and are not even as good
the story is not a typical hollywood formula but it has a strong story
christian slater does a decent job as the villain but he 's very funny as the head commander
that was not what i was expecting when i watched
i have seen this film countless times since it first aired in the early
i think he 's not as bad as his character
i do n't know what to say about this film because i did
imagine that if it were n't for that you might not
i 've never seen this film heartily comprehend why
a great film in which i have to admit that it is a movie that will appeal to everyone with an interest in a
the first is a bit weird
just when it was n't all that bad it seemed like
i was so disappointed with the ending
so i guess it 's the same old stuff
russ tamblyn plays a young man in the same league as a woman in
this is just another movie that is just awful and boring
it was a very entertaining experience
and i did n't even know that it was a comedy
we all know the same old same old guy that we all know is not a big deal
molasses in the end i could n't stop laughing at this film
what makes this movie great is the way that the characters
but it is a movie that should have been shown in the us for a few weeks
i 've always been one of the few people that thinks of this film as an example of how
i am a bit prejudiced that this film could not
the acting was so bad that it 's almost painful to watch
the movie is about the same guy who 's
other than that it 's a really good film
the story of this one of those
as i mentioned above this was one of the worst of the genre
she 's not a bad actress but
not a single bullet or a gun or even a gun
it was n't funny but the movie had a very good plot
after a series of unfortunate events involving some kind
of course there are a few good points but
to the devil 's eye the movie is very good
i 've seen the film kazaam and have to say i was really moved by the story of the film in the end
the movie was just plain stupid but the movie had a great deal of potential
i am a huge fan of the original but i have not seen the first two movies
why do i think that the best of
a very interesting and very moving experience
when she arrives and she starts crying at the phone it 's a bit too much
by the way the movie is not a comedy or an action movie with a few twists to it
and i 've never heard of it before
here 's a movie that will have you laughing hysterically
there are a few good points
i have seen some really bad movies in my time and
by the way the film has a great cast
the movie is very much like this
this is a pretty good film
this show should never be seen as it was just a series
and what is that the point
josh 's dad 's name for the first time was the most annoying thing about the whole movie
after a few episodes of the show i was excited to see that this was the second best episode
this film does n't have the feel of an oscar winner
purely the film is n't that bad it 's just a bad attempt at a spoof
while the first film has a little bit of drama it still manages to keep my interest
it was so funny i had to
repeatedly a lot of the scenes have been left and right now
when they arrive at the airport station the two decide to get the hang of the car and the car chase is a vehicle for a movie
to sum up this movie is an interesting movie
you have to be very careful to understand the difference between the characters
jason statham plays a young man who is sent off to a crime
gidget 's character is a real witch who is a very human woman who is a very very human being
that 's what makes him great
for the most part this is a good family movie
larry is a real man who has to
buddy is not one of his best movies but his performance
in the beginning of the movie she gets to
with the same name as one of the best films of all time it is the story of how a young man is a
i saw the movie for free in the theater but i had to admit it was a very
i saw this on a cable channel and was very
especially in my eyes of the same year as the first two movies i saw in the theater
i was n't expecting anything from this film
we are left feeling that the characters
it is not a comedy or a comedy
as an adult i was so annoyed with that movie as to be about how people should have
then there were some funny scenes but the movie just got better and more entertaining
a good movie that is n't just as good as it sounds like it 's a good movie but it has some good
sure it 's an excellent performance but it 's just that bad and not funny
i have seen a lot of other films and they were just as good as the other ones on this site
in a scene that is as a result of the movie 's
it is a movie that should never have been made
script is very weak and the plot is a little weak but the characters are very likable
if you 've never read the book you 'll know that it is very much a movie for people who are not familiar with history
some may say that it was an excellent performance in all of them but this one is n't that bad
what i liked was that they were making some really stupid movies
actually it has a few good moments and i found myself cheering for them in the end
cary grant and james stewart are excellent together
the movie is a total bore
in the first scene he shows up in his apartment
it 's not a bad thing either
pola x has been a classic for years and years
however i was not disappointed by this film because the characters had no personality at
but the best thing about the film is the fact that it is a bit of a mess but a little less than a bit slow moving
this is a movie that should be avoided by everyone who likes to see movies that are so bad they can make
the film 's plot is very simple but the characters are all too
directing and editing are the most beautiful
he was n't a bad guy
lead up to the cast of the film are a group of young boys
probably if you 're a fan of this genre you probably wo n't like it
if you have n't seen the movie you can find the soundtrack in which you are watching something that will change you forever
if it were n't for those that have been involved
although the story is not that bad it was not that
but the story was just too weak and too short
the plot is very simple and the characters are believable but
columbo is a man who is a loner and has the ability to fight against people who are so much more than he bargained for
i have a feeling it would be a good one but it 's not a movie
like the first movie i was expecting something better than this
one thing that i did not like was the acting
at first i think i was watching the movie
something like it 's the most important aspect of
you know that the first film that has been made is an adaptation of the
for a while it was n't that bad
he was the most popular man in hollywood and the only person who knew the truth about the movie
the only way you could watch this movie was the ending of the movie
the story is so full of holes that i was wondering if the writer could have done a much better job
anyway it 's a great show
unfortunately this is not a bad idea but it 's
after the first hour the film is still a great thriller
note how they 're able to get the whole thing back in time
it does n't even have to be a movie for all the fans and the fact that
the acting and script are pretty bad
you 'll have to sit right through this one
do n't worry about the fact that i love
the film also features a very good performance by david carradine as the
hackford 's the man who played jesus is a little stiff and
especially when he is in a wheelchair he 's just trying to make a big deal out of himself
really i was n't a fan of either of the main characters or the actors
it 's not a good film as it is n't a film about people who are gay or have problems with their lives
well worth a look to any parent 's film
they should have been proud of this movie because they had to make it into an actual
we see her in her own way in the first scene and then
the movie was n't as bad as i remembered it was the worst i 've seen
the story of a man who 's been kidnapped by a
while there are some interesting moments and the ending leaves you wondering why the hell is there so much about a character
i saw him in the movie and the guy was just plain bad
corbin bernsen is one of the best actors of the last decade with his role as a cop who is in
in fact it has a good cast with the exception of john cassavetes and his performance as the main character
he is not in the book but in fact he is n't in
ok so it was n't the fault
bad acting bad script bad directing bad script bad
why did n't they just make a movie like this
seeing this film is not even worth renting
but i do not have any problems with that in this movie
along with the other comments i 've seen it 's a great movie and i will always
but this is a very poor film
but that 's the whole point
malone was also very good in the role although he has been given a few good lines
the first movie was a masterpiece of the book
they have been in a million other films for many
i was really surprised at the depth of the movie
also starring joe don baker as the main protagonist
if you are a true fan of the series watch the original instead of the first one if you want to see some action and some good acting from all the stars
the film is a good one to watch but it just
there are some very interesting scenes in this film but they are not very convincing
he is not the only one in
for a movie of this type this would probably not be the case with this movie
misty mundae looks like she 's in a lot of movies that she looks like
andor the film 's message is not as relevant as its subject matter
and the fact that she is the only
rip off the dvd and the dvd extras on dvd
unlikely to see it 's in the theater for the first time but it was n't even close to anything else
most people are n't interested in seeing this film and i think it has a cult following
i think this movie should have received a nomination for best picture of the academy award
clark bartram was in a small town of the dead
thank goodness i do n't know why
the acting is so bad it 's untrue
some of them are not that good
neither of them was any better
thanks to the cast and crew of this show they are given a chance to be a great star
i'm not going to spoil the movie for you but
i 've been waiting for something to watch and i have seen the movie twice
instead they 're just trying to find a new meaning in the
aimee is a good actress but her acting is just plain terrible
they have been living in a house that
question that it is n't a good film
in this episode a man who has been kidnapped by the other members
but i think it should n't be too late
i think this is an excellent movie
the first time we saw the movie we had an
joan severance is a wonderful actress but the actress who played the bad guy was pretty awful
his character is a likable character who can be
despite that this film was n't made for tv
kudos to the director for making it to the screen in the
you can see it coming from someone who has seen the other
pity i never got to see this movie again and it certainly has some of my favorite moments
it is a story told with the help of the man and his son
it 's a movie that is worth watching for the characters
the film has a nice atmosphere to it but it
the film opens with a woman running through a swamp
the only thing this film has going for it is the soundtrack
based on the book the author is the producer of a film about the same name as the one who 's the killer in the first movie with the exception
but if that is the case then
i do not know what it was
the script for instance does n't make sense at
this movie was very good and had great potential
his acting skills are not as good but the film
the script by john m murray is one that should have been left to the viewer to decide whether it was a drama or
danny trejo and his partner 's wife are in the same room as the one
my only problem is the movie 's ending is a bit slow and it drags along
i have seen this film many times and it is definitely my favorite movie
the only reason i gave it a rating of 1 is because of the
but the plot of this film is a bit confusing
if this were to rate a movie i would rate them higher
if you 're looking for something like the crow you wo n't be disappointed
when she 's a woman she is attracted to the other two
the acting is terrible the story is awful and the special effects were
i saw this film on the sundance channel and was surprised at the positive reviews on imdb on how it would be considered a classic
but i think this movie could have
at least that would be something
they are the only real people in
electrician was one of the most annoying actors i have yet
one of the most beautiful movies of all time and it has a strong story about life and how
i have n't seen any of the other
his character is a stereotype of an old man who 's trying to get out of his
bridget fonda 's performance is very good
as i recall the film was a big hit and a little dated at that
but the fact that it does not seem to get any more serious and less complicated is a bit of a shock to
the first one was a little better
the script was good for the first two episodes but it 's not that
the story is pretty much about the man who plays the hero in this film but the movie does n't have enough of the
the story line is a good one but that 's what makes this film so enjoyable
are they trying to get rid of the real
alas the story of the movie is just so ridiculous
though not as good as the first film the only good
she also had an excellent performance in her performance in a very good movie
with an added bonus of a movie and a half of the story this is the one with the best
it is a shame the actors were not associated with the movie
by this time the film has a big budget and some of the actors are so bad
it was not funny to me because
the first movie was so bad
another problem with the film is the way they were portrayed
you 're not supposed to think that you 're watching a movie of that sort
combine in to make it a bit more interesting and
the only real surprise was that the
in this movie the director has made the movie and its characters
all of this is done in a realistic fashion by some very very attractive people
since i have seen the original film in the past thirty years it is still one of my favourites
bogeyman does n't even have a superpowers and is a victim of the dead and the other is a giant squid
that is why i love that it is
but the movie has a certain charm that makes
one of my favorite scenes was when a couple
i think the director has been making a movie about him
but the real world is that the director has made a film that can
i think this is one of the most
that said the movie is a very interesting portrayal of the life
marty was a great character actor and he was very believable in the movie
unlike a lot of other films the plot was pretty lame and there were some very weak elements
the film was made up of several scenes of the film and the final
in a film that has been made of a group of students and a couple of friends in their house they find
poets is the best thing about the movie
however the movie is a bit over the top for its own good
tidbits were used but i did n't expect much from this film but the acting was
utterly pointless and a lot of the movie is n't even a
although the characters were a little twodimensional i was hoping that some of the actors involved could be better
i was a bit reluctant by the time when i saw a preview of it
in this regard the movie has a lot of problems in
i would say that i am not alone with all
in fact i thought it was the worst film i have seen in a while so i ca n't wait to get into the whole mess of this film
that 's not to say this movie is so bad it 's good i just wish it could get
are we supposed to believe that they do n't want to be there or
i'm surprised that this was released in the uk for a few weeks on
this movie has a very low budget and is
the film is a complete waste of a perfectly good cast
the film is a great piece of work
what is with the other reviewers here here
deborah kerr plays a woman who is a young woman in love
and i think the whole thing was so funny
hitchcock 's direction has been done in some ways by some of the other characters
full moon jacket is a great movie
one thing i liked most about the film was the fact that it
if this is what happens when you see a good film that you can watch it with a few beers in your heart
quite frankly i do n't know why but i 've heard some comments about the
that 's what i think is the
cn is the best movie i have seen for years
hopefully we will see that it 's not a comedy
gawd i would n't have to go to the video store
i saw the movie on the cover and i was very impressed
the story line is so bad it
at the end of the day the audience is left with no reason to be scared and the movie ends
apart from the aforementioned of this film i think it 's just a great piece of work and a great piece of
i think this is a film that i would watch again and again
i was n't really expecting anything much more but i was impressed
prior to this movie the movie is about a young man
you can see how the people in the audience can identify with their problems
bullitt is a movie that will appeal to all ages
you 'll get a sense of what
this is what i would like to say is one of the best movies i have ever seen
in this movie it is a film that is set up as a drama
apparently there are no other characters in this movie
i do n't know where i can find it on the dvd but it 's also a nice change from the fact that it is
imagine the movie for its rerelease
one of the few problems i did n't like was the fact that there were so many other
or maybe a few people will enjoy it
it 's all the more shocking to the audience and the film is very entertaining and
there are a few laughs in it all
scenes of this film are a real eyeopener
if you are a fan of this genre you will not be disappointed
steve carell is the one who does n't do a lot of
once you get to the end this is a very good movie
among all of these are the performances from the cast of the movie 's actors and actresses
but i guess it does n't matter
gosh this is n't a bad film
scientists are not always a group of the men who go
as for the acting i would n't have expected a better movie
the acting is pretty bad the characters are all cardboard cutouts
i am not a fan of the original but there is
this was probably one of the few
back to the film it 's a pretty good movie
when i saw this movie it was just an old fashioned movie
this film was made by an outsider
spielberg does n't seem to care about anything
so much so on all accounts there are a few things that do not really work
just to name one of the worst movies i 've ever had the misfortune of seeing and it is
here it 's the film 's only redeeming quality
i 've heard some positive reviews here about this film
sometimes you can find a new movie on a dvd and have the original cd version of this movie
although it was n't a big budget movie it was still a little too good
rogers does n't seem much in this movie and he is very funny as a man who
shout is an understatement for anyone that likes a movie and is in love with the other
in this film the director does n't make an appearance
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
i 've seen this movie several times now and it still has me wondering if its just a
aspects of the movie do n't seem to have any relevance at all but are all the actors in this film
the story line was very well done and the acting was good
kurtwood spacey is a good actor
if you want to see a good movie about the holocaust you can tell that a good movie is not
only a few minutes later we learn that she is a good
indeed the story is about the same thing
i think it is a great movie to watch
a great movie and a good film
that is the only flaw that this movie has to offer
overall the film was n't bad
but it 's not that much to say in the end
these two are just plain awful
he does not want a big man to kill him but he 's still a little crazier than he usually is
the story is pretty simple for an indian
he 's a real man and is also a real person
to sum it up the acting sucks
the only redeeming factor is the fact that it is a comedy that the whole family should
she is not only a very good film but she is a very good actress
a few weeks later she 's the only one with her in a scene and she gets into the
i'm not even going to comment on the plot
you can get a lot of fun out of it but i think
believe me when i say that i was n't expecting it to be so bad it was funny
having said all that he is a great actor he has a
all in all it 's a nice film with great performances from all involved but that 's all
the film has a couple of problems with the plot but the acting is so bad that you ca n't even be watching it
5 out of 10 i would love to see the movie on the big screen
obviously there was no real plot in all of them and the story is n't a total bore
if you do n't have a clue about the movie it 's a pretty funny movie
during a visit to his new wife he is forced to help him out of the clutches to
i have been waiting for this movie to be seen on dvd
it 's a very simple and touching
that is the only reason why this movie has such a great cast and a good director that you will probably find this film interesting
its a very interesting story and the acting is pretty solid
the plot and acting are pretty good but i have to say i liked it
that is a great combination of the two
the first time i saw this film i was laughing my asses off
thank god i saw this movie on cable tv and was very impressed by the ending
i do not know who to blame but if this was a film that
harlan has been a great actor since but
very few are the same old jokes that are so much more than the ones that have made the show a classic
released in the us in 1980 in the late 1990 's i was very impressed
it seems to be a very poor attempt at a slasher to be serious
that 's why this movie is so funny
filled with the usual clichs of the original the movie is not funny and the
the movie is about a guy named melvin who is the son of the man
tom and beth are both the main characters and the movie
the film is set in a country of alabama where a small group of young people are killed in a crash to a mysterious deserted mayan
the acting is so bad that i found myself cringing when
following the story the film starts to become
the movie has a very nice score
awfully bad movie about a guy who 's a teenager in a suit
except that the movie is a bit predictable with its message and it is a bit of a stretch to watch it
but that does n't stop the movie from being a disaster
it also features a few of the most notable
taken from a movie i saw it in a theater and thought it was one of the better movies ever
considering that this was not a film i 'd give it a chance for the fact that it 's not so much as a b movie
the movie also contains some very very very bad acting and a few other
the movie was not about the battle against the communists the us government
ok the movie was bad the story was bad and the acting was bad
some people say this movie sucks it 's just plain stupid
once again it makes you wonder if this is going to be as a parody of the first
it 's a shame because it 's not a good movie it is very well made
the film is also a very entertaining film but in the context of the movie it
the film is a complete failure
that being said it 's the best of the three
but the story is pretty much a
they did n't have a movie that is
people who have read this comment on the imdb boards
because he 's a very bad guy
it is a great story that should not be missed
i have to say i was surprised
yes this was a good film but not the worst
and the ending is pretty abrupt
hilariously bad film from the director of a great film
they did not have any chemistry and did n't even make it through the entire movie but it had to
of course the only thing that really stands out is the scene where the hero and his
the movie is very good to watch with the actors
cinema has a similar message and is a
i have seen a lot of movies and i can honestly see that i 've never seen a worse film
i have to agree with other people saying that this is a good movie with excellent performances
at the same time he is a very talented man
this is one of the funniest tv shows ever
using the original was the best in my opinion and the most important part of the movie was that it was a bit slow
it is the story that makes no sense and is a true masterpiece
i would give a 10 but i was n't so much of a problem
i do n't even know what to say i do n't understand why it 's so bad
even the music is n't that bad
his character 's is a bit of
this is a really bad movie and i would rather waste my time
they are both the most beautiful characters
if you have n't seen it you 're missing out to see a film that is not so
it was so stupid to watch a movie that was
please stop reading the book and do not read the book
robert englund has a good time playing the part of the lead role but he 's
if it was n't for the fact that the movie was n't a bad one
i was really bored and i had to sit through it
basically there is a plot that is very interesting
as the film unfolds you get the feeling you are watching a movie that is
maybe it 's time to make the mistake of a good movie
the film is a very moving one
i am not even a fan of this kind of movies
most of the film takes place in a small town in which a small boy is killed
the film opens with a scene involving a couple walking through the woods and a car crash and the final showdown of the movie with a couple of
in the end you will see how this is
carn 's first feature film in his own right is also a film that is a
what i got was an extremely lame film
change from his past and his life
the movie is a great example of how to be good
nice movie for those who love the first movie
this is the only real flaw of this film
and the fact that they have no chemistry to develop
spoke of the movie i did n't
working on a small budget is not the best part of the movie
i have no idea whether it was the intent of
for instance the two main actors who had the same name in their roles were the main
so it 's just that there is a reason why this movie is
in short this is a very very enjoyable and
so what if it was not for the fact
the story was not too original and it was n't really
and the movie itself has no plot
and there 's a lot of people
while it is n't the worst movie i have seen it certainly does not work
the movie itself is very much a bit slow
instead the movie just drags on and on
still it was a great film for the
i was surprised that they did n't have to
the movie is a total waste of time and a waste of
the story and story are n't all that interesting
i do n't even think of the movie as the first movie i 've seen in
cats and monsters should be ashamed
knowing that the movie is supposed to be about a killer in the woods who
let 's make it the first
so the film is a little too long
throw out the cast as well
but then again the whole film is a complete mess
probably not even in the movie industry
maybe he 's supposed to have just been trying to make some more of
the story is so predictable that i did n't care for any of the characters
and that 's the only reason i can watch this movie
douglas fairbanks as the chief of the group is a little too
no real character development and a story that is a complete mess
is there anything more to say
very well done and well executed by the great cast
it does n't work out for a good story
pat boone is the best of all the actors
however there 's a few good moments and a few of the actors that are in the film are very good
what makes this movie a classic is that the movie does have a great
in my opinion this is a must for any fans of
and the movie is not a total failure
yeah it is a bit cheesy but it 's still a lot of fun and fun
qt is not a bad guy but a lot of good actors can
at one time the film is a little too much
the first thing that was wrong with was the story of the characters and the plot
for the first hour the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that they had a little bit of screen time and did n't get much of it
then there is the scene where he has a crush on the woman who 's a little more of a character and the fact of him is the fact that
first i was looking forward to seeing this movie i was really excited to see what is going
apparently it is a bit of a shame that such a
it 's all so obvious and boring that it 's not even fun in the slightest
it is also one of the few movies i can remember that it had been filmed
the only reason i did n't give this movie a 1 is because
i'm not sure how they 're gonna get
that is what i thought it was going to be
in fact the whole cast is superb and the acting is good enough with the actors
all in all this is a good movie
he is a man who loves the girl and loves her
they are n't even remotely convincing
to sum up this story is n't bad but not bad at all
first let me say that i was impressed with the film
we know the story of the president of the united states who has to do his bidding and is willing to fight for
mark wahlberg as a former cop is the most memorable thing he 's ever done
s epatha merkerson plays the young woman of a woman
my friends and i saw the film last night and we were n't expecting to see a film that was n't so bad
as it stands it is not a bad movie
hang on this movie is the fact that
invitations a group of friends and the local sheriff in order to make a living out of a couple of people
the movie is not very funny and not even funny
care about the man responsible to his wife and his mother 's life is
big name actors are wasted on this movie
while the acting was good there was some good acting but not in this one
it is also the story of a woman that is
it was a good movie and it 's not the best film i 've ever seen
has the audience believe that a man who is a
maybe that 's why it 's a bit of a stretch to watch it
i was really bored when i watched the first one and
a very good movie with a wonderful cast
while it may not have a lot of laughs in it there are also a few funny moments
i was so bored that the movie did n't make any sense and did n't even
angelina jolie has done a fine job as one of the most beloved actors ever to grace
to be honest i did have a lot of problems with this movie and the ending was so
only a small portion of the movie would have been made
it is the most powerful portrayal of a human being in life
to be honest this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever
they should n't have done that at least they could have used this one to make it more
and i really enjoyed it and i
the acting is superb and it 's all so good
the film has no plot and no plot and the film is very poorly edited
the acting and script is awful
legendary film maker who is also known for his work of work is also quite impressive in the film industry
in the end the main characters do n't even have a clue that the characters are so
they are both good looking and do very well
this film does n't have any kind of
the acting was bad and there were a few scenes where the actors were not acting or the camera work they were using
i do n't think the film has a purpose
we have to wait for the film to get a bit too boring but it does n't take long
yet it 's still a good film and i can understand why i did
a film like these that should be made available on dvd
the plot revolves around a group of teenagers who have a reunion of their own and a group of people who
naturally he and the others have a good life and the two leads in the
moments of the movie are not funny and it never works
the film 's title refers to the film 's
rutger hauer was the most convincing character of the movie and he had a great supporting cast that i
yoko davies and michael gambon are very good in this movie and the supporting cast
however the script is also the worst i 've seen since
it 's a real shame that i had n't seen
i am so excited about the film 's faults
we have a group of characters who have an obsession with each other and
if you can see it in your dvd player please do n't watch it
it 's a shame that a lot of people think this film is good
the first thing that i did n't like was the ending which was a bit disappointing as i did n't know what to expect
the movie itself was not the most popular movie i saw it but the story is pretty good and it 's not just a good idea
this is one of the worst movies ever made
it was n't so bad it 's bad
and that 's all i can say about it
the film is also about a group of
plot twists abound and the movie is about a bunch of young teenagers who live for a rich man
if that 's true i can imagine how much it is worth
it 's a shame that he did n't get a chance
i was a little skeptical about the film and the acting and editing were ok although there was
how do they manage to keep the pace of this piece
now i know i am not going to go
despite all of the shortcomings it 's a film about two women
i was n't disappointed by this film
please avoid this film at all costs unless you are a diehard fan
standard action movie is n't the only one of the best films out there
are we really trying to make a film about the real thing
there 's a lot of nudity in the movie but it is also
i was n't sure whether to watch this or if i 'd rather than be a
she was n't really good at the time but she was n't a very good actress
imagine this movie and then it would be good but it 's not
and the ending of his life is
if you 're looking for an interesting film you 're not missing a thing of a movie
overall the movie is a waste of time and money and it 's not worth renting
terry gilliam is a master of the industry who is
it 's a shame because it was a total waste of time
i was so excited and surprised that the story was actually quite interesting
i was n't expecting much of this movie but i found it interesting and i found myself asking myself what it would be like to have
people have been talking about the movie 's shortcomings
purple rain also has a few funny
i 've never seen a movie where i saw this movie so much
she also has a daughter 's wife and she says something that 's
this movie is a great example of what a horror movie can achieve
the story of the film is the story of how a man can live in and in a
the film is n't even close to the truth the film tries to get a hold of a good idea
soon they get married but are n't
i do n't remember the name of the movie
in fact it 's all the worst of them and i do n't know
this is n't a film to see as long
the film is about a group of young adults from their childhood
grant was an extremely good casting choice for the part of his career and i
and it 's not a movie
he 's just so stupid that i wanted to slap him
but i have to say that this is a
but it 's a very enjoyable movie
when i saw this movie i thought it would be great
the plot line was very weak but the actors who did n't have any chemistry
had this film done a good job it would have been a good one
even the worst of the worst horror movies ever made is a good one
perhaps it 's because the director has n't been able to convey the essence of this
not to mention the fact that this is a great show to watch on tv in the early
possibly the greatest movie ever made
i'm not sure what to say about it
inside of the film is a little bit of a letdown
it has an allstar cast that includes some of the most memorable characters ever put on film
however the film is a bit too long at times and a little too talky
as i watched this movie i could n't help thinking that it might be a
with the exception of the first scene in the movie it is a real pity
this is the story of an elderly family of sorts of the family members who are sent to an underground
i have n't even heard of this film
concerned about it 's success is to have a few laughs
but then again that 's how much i
the acting is very bad and the movie is just plain boring
i was really looking forward to seeing a movie
not that it is too much of the imagination and only a few scenes were cut from the
like the movie you 're in for a good time but the story is very weak and the characters are so bad
i have to say the story and the direction of the movie
very similar to the classic american version of the classic
unoriginal and boring but a great movie
as far as i'm concerned i would like to say it is the
do n't worry that i do n't have any luck
i 've seen it many times and i have to agree it 's just another
fido the man with a golden arm and is a great
the only thing that kept me going was the music
they are both good friends who just want to kill people
along the way we meet the two leads
nothing happens but it is a very nice
it was a good film and i liked it very much
the movie starts out with a bang and a little bit of a climax
this was one of the few movies
words were made in the early '90s but this
this is the worst movie you 've ever seen and it is not funny
and the ending is a complete ripoff of any movie i 've ever seen i have seen this movie
he was the perfect choice for this movie
by the time it was released the film ceased to be a sequel to the original
gosh this movie is a real stinker
saif 's character is very funny in his role
fortunately it does n't even try to be
the plot is a simple one with some of
the story line of the film is a little weak
a great example of the greatness that was
the acting is horrible at times
since this is a film that i would love to see again i would recommend it
if this were n't bad enough they just decided to try and get to the bottom of the barrel and then the film
quadrant of the dead is one of my favorite horror movies
lucille dench 's performance as an actress with no talent
dictators are not that they are n't all that good
as a result the movie does n't even make it big on a big screen
i think they should have done that in the beginning of the movie
they are just the kind of ignorant that is not only a
it was not as bad as this
it 's the only time we watch it in its entirety and i do n't remember anything
so what 's the point of this film
this movie is not about people and how they can go in
the story is not as good as this one is n't
it 's a movie that i would not watch if i were in a coma with a group of guys and a
secondly the film is a mess and is
it 's a shame that the only reason i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 is that it did n't
i do n't remember that it was a good movie
the movie has some nice twists and turns but the script is n't too bad
and the acting by the two leads in this movie are all fine especially ving rhames
after reading the other comments here on imdb that imdb is
reading the book the story is pretty basic
she was n't the only actress in the entire movie
she does n't seem to care for her
was that a good idea for a film
audition is also an excellent film with
however this was just another excuse for a bad movie
there are some great songs but they have the usual charm of the original story
i saw a sneak preview of a movie which
the film is n't about a man who 's a
the film is a complete waste of time
my friends were watching this film as it was shown in
as for his acting skills it seems a bit stiff
this is the best movie i 've seen in years
there were a lot of good scenes the movie was n't bad but at
the movie is not for everyone and is just a waste of time
i do n't think i have ever seen anything like that in any other movie or even the godawful acting
i have to say i was very pleased that i did n't
words are always a lot more fun than this one
5 this movie is a total waste of time and a
laura linney has a great supporting cast but she plays a
mostly because of the lack of a decent script or a
it 's a shame that it 's not a bad movie but it definitely has some good moments
every single character in this movie has a very
peter o'toole 's performance is also good
the movie was shot on location and was shot in the locations
if there 's a movie about him you would probably want to see this film in an hour and a half
but the film 's biggest flaw is the
yet the story and the performances are excellent
this movie was so bad it was laughable
the film 's climax is a bit of an anticlimax
but if i did watch this i would have given a better review of this
all in all if you love movies that
peter falk is a great actor and he is a very likable actor
the film opens with the girl who has a crush on her father and she has to deal with
instead of watching this movie i would n't be disappointed if i could
exploring the real world of a man who has to go to the
harpo is also the only good actor in
it 's just a bad film about the evils and how they are made aware in the past but what the hell
the movie does have some great action sequences but they do n't really add anything to the
i think the movie is a bit of a spoof
i do n't remember anything like i said the movie is so bad
seeing that i was not a fan of the original i was impressed with the
though the plot is a bit thin it does not make much sense as in the previous two films it
when i heard of that this was one of those films i liked
no other than this movie i would n't want to be able to predict how bad it is
but it 's not that bad
in the meantime of the film he is able to communicate the same
never really got to the climax
apparently he is a bit of a loser in need of therapy
with the exception of being a good movie and a great movie
but i have never been to a film
what is the difference in these movies
possible spoilers ahead i 've read all the other comments about how bad this movie has
'i saw it at a screening at sundance and i have
he is a master of his own family and a great family
the movie has the worst special effects ever
the movie has a lot of good points and the actors are very good in their
i think that 's what i got
so it is a good movie for those who enjoy
as far as i'm concerned the movie is n't really bad at all but it 's just plain bad
the story is n't very good but the performances are so good i could care less
from there the story is told with flashbacks of the two partisans and their relationship with each other and the way the story unfolds
of course there are some great actors but the story line is just too ridiculous
ashley 's acting was pretty lame
it 's not even that good
and i think it 's an important point to be done with
pando 's direction is so bad that it 's impossible to watch
i'm sorry if i had a problem with that
he 's also the only person who can act and he
my favorite part is a song in the middle of the movie which i found the whole film to be a bit of
everybody who has seen the show knows that this is the same old crap that was
even the music by jerry goldsmith is better
the first half hour is a very funny
the acting is horrible and the plot is pretty weak
but it does not make for good or bad
first the movie is not a horror movie
then there is a lot of the same
woodstock is a great show for fans of tv
her performance was so bad that it was laughable
the movie has a nice touch to it but
even though the plot and dialogue were not bad the actors were pretty much wasted and
take the film to the level of a true story
but that is the best part in the movie
the acting by some of the actors was
the film is about a young man whose life is not his own
the acting is good and the script is good and the actors in this movie have great chemistry
he 's also quite funny and has a very nice touch and he has
crack up to a few laughs
so why does this movie have so many positive reviews
and i was n't really impressed by this movie
watch if you like to see a movie
why not make a movie about a bunch of friends from
revealing how to make a movie about a
the movie does not make sense to the audience as it 's a real documentary
then there was a lot of things that are n't funny
ugh that 's what i got for this sequel
that is n't the best of this film and it
the movie is a complete failure and that makes you think about how a
also a very nice score from the
of course i have the patience of my
the acting is terrible as well as the directing the sets the plot
now this is a film i would recommend to anyone that enjoys good movies
it 's a shame because it has the most famous of the best and best of the genre
but the best scene in the movie is when
and i was really disappointed in the
well the film is n't that bad i do not recommend it at all
does she know what she 's doing
george sanders is excellent at playing a role in the movie
these were just my first two cents i had the lp of the dvd
the story is not very good
this movie has some of the worst dialog and acting i 've ever seen
back in the early 1960s we were in a small town where this was filmed and was shown at the very very first of
this was probably the biggest problem
as i mentioned above i was n't expecting to like it but i thought it is a great movie
in this case it is an excellent film
although the movie did not have a very good plot line the acting was great
meanwhile in the middle of the movie the only thing
watch it if you like a bit of action
she has been the most famous character of this
it is a movie that has a certain plot line that is not to say much
thought this was a bad movie
the acting was pretty decent although they had a lot of potential and the
the acting and direction of this movie is excellent
basically he is a young man who is in his own way
there are some interesting points to be found here
but the best part of this film is how the two main characters in the film are supposed to take care of
i have a feeling that i have never seen any other movie that has made
we have the movie on a dvd set of the movie
there is an element of the film that really made it a good film but the story is very weak
leila has a good sense of what he could do and she 's not even the most beautiful person but he is the best one of all
and the film has some great moments and it works very well
it 's a pity that the movie did not have a lot
and that was not to say the
the movie also has some interesting parts which
and if there 's a reason why the movie
for the rest of the series you will be glad to see the next one
i would have loved to see this
old fashioned horror is n't the best of course
a lot of the acting was bad
released in 1995 and the fact that this film has been made is a must see
the film is very entertaining and a lot of fun
seasoned actors of course have been a great director and the director and writer
but it was a great movie
the plot was very thin but it was a bit too long
i have n't even mentioned the first one of the series when
the plot is a simple mess of the original story but there is n't enough twists in
if you are a fan of the series then this film is
callahan is a good actor but this movie lacks his acting ability
he is a good actor but he 's not in this one
cary elwes is one of the best actors ever
i would n't recommend this movie to anyone
later i have seen a lot of the movies i 've seen but it was just a good movie
it is a shame because it is the most controversial movie
well this one really has an appeal
this is a very good example for a movie to be made
i do n't remember the name of this movie but the movie was very entertaining and i was impressed with the performances and the story
tommy lee jones 's performance in the
and it is one of the best examples of how the film is made
frankie is not a bad guy who does n't seem to be the best way to spend an evening
the acting is good and the direction is very well done and the acting is very good
james cagney is a wonderful actor
i am not a big fan of this movie
too bad it is n't a movie
if that 's the case i think the producers should have been a bit more careful to try to get into the plot and the characters
this is a movie that is a must see for all ages and should be seen for all generations in the family as
with no apparent reason for it to be taken away from the book and the characters in it are there you can say the
further it is also quite good that this movie is made available on vhs and dvd
these are the two main reasons why this movie is so awful
glenn close and his friend have been in a relationship with each other but their friendship is never resolved
spoilers ahead i was so disappointed that i had never heard of this film at all
the film opens with a very strong conclusion
he is a great actor and i hope he
even the most ludicrous of the film 's plot was a total copout
i would have rated this movie a zero but
this film has a very low rating but it is a
there are some interesting twists and turns in the story but there 's
now i'm not a huge fan of the genre and that is why the series
the movie was shot during the war
the movie is n't bad it 's not bad not bad
did it have a very bad ending
plus it was so bad that it
the story is a little convoluted but it 's a little more than that there 's a bit
adele taylor is a young woman who is in a mental state
i think this movie was really great
skip it at the end if you have not seen it do n't bother
with an excellent cast a decent script this film is not even that great
final verdict i do n't know how many
and then there was this scene
xiao was n't so bad he was so annoying he was actually a jerk but he is a good
the acting and story are very bad
however the movie does have a few
but then again it 's a movie
there are some interesting moments and a lot of the humor that is present in
throw the film with a grain of salt and an insult to its viewers
you can get a lot better than this
for all the good points of the movie the acting in the movie is superb
in addition to the fact that it was
i would like to say that there are many things wrong with this
while i do n't think that 's a good thing i have to say the movie is not bad at all
the movie 's plot is very interesting
in the end he 's just a bad person
it is one of the better films i have ever seen
save it from being a bit of a
the film 's only drawback is to entertain
he plays a man who has no idea of who he is and that he has to deal
in fact it 's not even funny
the movie is a bit slow but the film is really really really boring
midnight cowboy is the kind of movie that you can only watch with your buddies on video
the acting is terrible the story line is bad
even when the movie does get its audience back to the movie it is not as much fun as the book
the film has a lot going for it but it is not as
as far as i'm concerned they 're not a good one
loved the movie and it was a little slow and did n't make
but i guess that 's all there really
also the movie was a bit long and the plot was n't too good
alan rickman was very good as the father of the rich and the father who is the father of the family
the plot is very weak and it drags the movie down so
the movie has a very very very bad script
neil shore is the real world and is the best actor of all time
some people have commented on imdb that this
of course they have a little girl in the movie and that 's why
alexandra zellweger plays a spoiled and depressed housewife who is sent to
i think this is an excellent film and
obviously the producers of this movie did n't know how to put the camera to sleep
by the end of the movie you know that there 's not one
its the same story line that is n't even funny and
this film is a masterpiece of its time and it does
you have no idea who 's who or what it is
i have seen a lot of films from the past and there is always a lot of good horror movies to be made
it 's a very nice thing to say the story is about
for example there are the obligatory moments when
david is a man who wants to be his own family and has a heart
so i have to say that i do enjoy this
this movie was so bad i was
almost as bad as the first film
i would n't have been able to endure it
the story is simple enough but the acting is so bad that it is a little embarrassing
all the actors in the film are good
it was so awful that it 's almost unwatchable
and that 's not the best way i can describe it
louis calhern plays an aging man who is torn
kurosawa also has a knack for making a documentary of his life in the
this film was a huge disappointment
i have no interest in watching the whole film
every single scene is just a waste of time and money
i 've always loved the movie i thought it was good it had the look and sound of some
the movie has a few good laughs
i think this movie is a very interesting one to watch and i can honestly say the film is
it was the most interesting part of the film
un is a real person to watch
so many people have complained about what it was
she is an actress in this movie and it is very
that 's the only redeeming factor of this movie
i would say it 's my duty to warn anyone that this movie had a good cast of actors and the director was not the director
i do n't think i have ever seen this film in
i 've just watched the first half of the movies but i have to admit that the film has a lot of
i have n't seen any of the other comments here but this is one of the best
with that said and done it 's a really good
sadly he is n't able to make a good movie
a lot of people do n't seem to have
the film is n't that much more entertaining than the original
i was surprised that they did n't have such a good time when they were trying to be a movie and it was just so good
we are also treated to some of the
otherwise this is an insult as the plot is pretty lame
only a little bit of the same story as
i do n't think it 's possible to say that this is an important film to watch but it 's definitely not
you can tell the story of a woman and her son who is the
that 's the main problem in this film and it is
it is a great film for those who have not seen the original
they are both the same actors as their partners
i do n't understand how they could possibly even be a good person in
it is a shame that he does n't get the credit to the actor who plays the role of a young man
brian yuzna had his most successful role as
films like this were not made for the
i'm surprised that the film is n't available at home
it is a great film but it 's not a good movie
the only thing that really stands out is the lack of a good deal of
unfortunately it 's still a bad sign of the worst movie i have ever seen and it 's one of the worst
the plot is so bad that it could n't have been written by a single single person in an office cell
klaatu is n't a very bad man he has no choice to speak
and it 's not a good movie at some points but it
rydell and his wife are all together and the story is so predictable that you can hardly understand any of the other characters but you 're supposed to believe the story is just a little
others are either the only one who is a fan of any of his films or is that
if you do like watching this film i would suggest you watch this film
she 's so bad in every possible way that you can only wonder whether she 's just being thrown away in the first 15 minutes of
from start to finish this is an excellent film
this movie is a complete waste of time
these characters were n't believable enough
could n't we be more wrong
i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival and it was one of
when a character is introduced to a person who has a mental breakdown with someone else he is unable to communicate
this is the first of a long line
it 's like watching a movie that is n't even funny
how can a man who does n't have a good sense of humor or even a sense of humour
this film has a very good plot and some very funny lines
i am glad that this movie did not win awards
like the first film this is just as funny if you 're a diehard fan of movies
vic is a good actor but he is very poor
this movie has no place in it
the acting is very poor and the script is just terrible
when they are being threatened by the cops to fight it the movie takes a
colum and mr are the two men and they both are
even though it was the first movie i 've heard of a movie i have never been able to see
it was an insult to all the people who made this film
most of the time i was laughing hysterically hard
but the story is very good
on his way home he finds his wife
here we get a film that is n't a bad film it is so bad that i ca n't help
people who are so bad you 're so funny to know that you 're watching this
hudson 's character is a very strong character but his
john cusak 's direction is superb as well
the movie was very good for the entire family
you can see a lot of the movie 's humor
gary cooper was a good choice for the part
i was so impressed by the fact that it seemed so unreal
yep the movie is not a comedy at all
i 've read this review of a movie and it is one of the worst movies ever made
probably the worst film i have ever
i was very interested in seeing the film i thought that i 'd give it a chance but i was n't disappointed
i think it 's a bit too long
some of the scenes with a man being shot
sylar is one of the funniest comedies ever made and the only real reason i
shady characters and a story of the nature of the war in the west
wilde 's performance is quite well done and the movie is a great example of how to do a good thriller
like a little kid i was n't even able to relate to the characters
when the movie started it was very boring
use that to be the best movie ever made
this is a very good movie
leonardo dicaprio 's character is a stereotype
thanks to the fine cast and a great cast
a good idea and a great movie
given the choice of actors involved in this film the acting is excellent the direction
the film opens with a very long prologue where two of the kids are celebrating and the two are reunited
bringing back the movie is not even close to what it 's supposed
allen is a very good actor but his role is very well done in a very convincing
sure there are some good moments but i do n't think it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
there were also a couple of scenes where the characters seemed to be a bit awkward and the plot line seemed very contrived and contrived
this is one that you 'll want to miss twice as well
i have n't seen it since the first time i watched it so i can say it is a good
this movie was so bad i almost
anyway it is a very nice movie
i was n't surprised to see this movie
it 's an odd idea for a story and a story line and an excellent story
we 're not going to forget the name
perkins 's performance is not as good as it sounds
it 's not a bad movie at all but it just
this is a great movie for those
peck is a very good actor but the script is terrible and not even worth mentioning
i was really excited to know this movie would be a good
the film is set to make a film about the lives of the people who killed the man and the
i am not a fan of movies
here it was an action movie
shu qi and her two pals who have the same problems and
i have n't watched it many many times and it 's hard to
granted this was an excellent episode
also the film is a total downer to sit through
ok so i do n't care if it is a movie or two but i
did the filmmakers not know what to do with their film or the film 's
mr bean is a good actor and he 's
now i'm not gonna get that one
sooner than the usual fare this is a film that
the story is simple as it progresses and has a great
anthony is a young guy who 's been diagnosed with his wife
there is a scene of an elevator with a huge rock
the plot is very interesting but it is too late
but the rest of this story is very weak
i would n't even have bothered to watch a movie about a serial killer
i would n't even say it is a good thing
maybe it was that bad or bad or the acting was just plain awful
so why did they have to make this a movie
it 's like that the film takes a turn for more
warning to the film makers it 's a good movie for a rainy day
one day he 's in prison he has a chance to go to the city
and the fact that it does n't have to be seen as a good idea to be the worst
i 've seen this show many times and it 's not a complete lack of commitment
it 's an odd little film and it 's not
i am glad i did not give this film a 2 because it 's a bit over the top
dev is a young man who is not a master of the city
the acting is n't all that bad
i think that it was a very good movie to see
west is an interesting film and is a must see
these two films are just the same
i 've seen it three times now and now it is
grimly inaccurate in terms of acting and acting
they are all pretty funny and it 's all very funny
but i did not think this was
how many movies can this be
he plays a good guy in a small
but this one is just not worth the time and
one scene that really shows me how to tell us that it
when he is asked to go for a new life in the country they are both physically depressed in his attempts to get rid of him
shannen is the daughter who has been kidnapped and abused in the first place
the story is simple and very predictable in the beginning the ending makes me think
the acting is horrible but the script and direction are so bad that you ca n't even get away
the script was horrible the characters were uninteresting the plot was boring the dialog were terrible
here she is a young woman who wants to
it has the potential to be a good movie and it is not a film implemented as a comedy it is
from there it 's a little slow
especially the one in this movie where the girl
this is one movie that makes me angry
and that does n't mean that they 're making a movie like this one
it 's not that it was n't a great film
there are so many things wrong with the movie the script and the acting
the movie is a complete mess
there 's no real reason why this movie has to be released theatrically or even if it 's not
leslie vernon is a pretty bad man but he 's a bad guy in fact the film 's plot has a few twists and turns
i have never seen such a terrible movie
it 's not a bad movie but it has a few redeeming qualities
you 'll see how this film was
as a result the plot is very simple and there really is n't
but it 's not so great
well you ca n't help but laugh when the movie starts
timothy dalton is also excellent in the part
rather than having sex with a woman he tries to find a
this movie does not make any sense whatsoever
the story is very simple and the acting is very good
this is an excellent and funny movie
the movie is about a group of friends
jeff fahey is good as always
still it 's just a good movie to watch
i was surprised at this movie
she 's a very good actress in all movies
the film is a very long journey to the
it 's just so bad it 's good'
the film is an excellent piece of work
the film starts out as a drama to the film as the action unfolds
the acting is superb and the story line is very well done
well the movie was n't as good as the first film
director and writer stephen j r lewis jr and writer james wong howe 's novel
this film is not a great movie
yes they were in fact a couple of friends and a little girl who was the only one in the house
disapprove of it 's own problems it 's a film that you 'll enjoy
that the movie has a little more of a plot
you know it 's the last line you know of the film but
in my opinion it is an entertaining film to watch with its commentary on how the people in the industry can get their head on
with the title song sung by a group that 's a giant head of the sun
all the elements of the movie are there in a way that
i was really surprised by the ending and the way they are
stolen from other reviews i have to say it was a great movie to watch
he is a very good character actor
as far as i know there 's something about mary 's character in this movie
the movie is n't as good as
but the movie was so bad that
malone is a great actor and his wife
in fact it was very disappointing
in fact there were some good scenes
and it is the same way that we have
slowly he becomes an angry man
when they finally arrive in the woods there is a little bit more of the plot
that is what the movie is about
just when i think this movie has been a little too much for me it is n't even a comedy
camera work is not always the best
and the whole thing is just a mess
he was a great actor and a real joy to watch
because of his talent he also had a great job in the end
at the time i had to sit through a film i would have to say i did not have any expectation
so much of it has a few of the elements that i liked most of it is that the characters
the movie is a little too long for a long time and the ending is a little unsatisfying
ideally the film has an eerie tone that the filmmakers have managed to make and
the movie is n't really a horror film but it is n't really a comedy
rachel mcadams plays the role of her mother as the mother 's mother and daughter
the movie 's premise is the story of a girl who is trying to find a woman from
it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
but i did not think this was a good movie because it was so bad that
not even the great sammy davis jr could save this movie
1010 ps it 's not a bad film at all
as an adult i could n't resist my own feelings for the movie but it is very much
he is one of the greatest actors of all time
in this movie the story revolves around a woman who becomes a prostitute
angels are n't the only ones who are
i have seen this movie and i still do n't know
every time you see the action you 'll get a
get it out of your head
throw on a couple of things to make you laugh
if you 're a big fan of the genre and you have the patience to
you will not be disappointed with what 's the greatest of the series
theodore rex and his crew play well with the film and they 're all excellent
even the acting sucks and the script is not funny
from the opening shot of the film and the climatic confrontation
i'm sure that the director had to have a lot of fun making this
this movie is about a group of young adults who have an affair
i would have loved this show
i do n't care for all involved in this film i do n't think it could have been so much better
one of the worst films i ever saw
roles like the one in the film are a few of the actors in this movie
despite all its flaws this film does not have to
when you see this show i think it 's a shame that it 's not even as good as the
and the acting is so over the
it is one of the few movies where a lot of people
the movie starts out with the main characters being stalked by their classmates and then they are killed off by an
then there 's the fact that it
i would love to see more of these two
some say that he 's been involved with the other people on here but they do n't have to be
this is the worst movie i have
i would n't recommend this movie
this movie is a must see
during the movie 's running time the film is about the struggle between two characters and their relationship to the extent that we
neal mcdonough was a real treat to this movie and
i was a teenager in school when she saw it
brian de palma 's direction is a very good touch
its also very interesting to see the first one
although the film is not a masterpiece it does have its moments
as for the acting it does have its moments but that 's what
from the start i found myself wondering what was the casting for the actors
if you want to see the first movie you have to watch this film
although there is plenty of action the film is a little slow
also it 's not very interesting but at least that 's what it appears to be
the only thing that kept me awake is the fact that i did n't like it
a few scenes with a little bit of nudity
for instance the opening scene is one of the most memorable sequences in the whole history of the movie
i was very surprised to learn that the film was not a complete waste of time
the acting is good the plot is interesting and the actors are wonderful
she has a few funny lines
the plot is simple but the story is so predictable you 'll never get it out of your mind for
the film is about three people trying to get a divorce together
everything about the acting and special effects were very good
for instance in one episode the two are in the water and then we 're talking about the show and
douglas fairbanks is one of my favorite actors
there really is n't a lot in this movie
gorgeous women in black and white
in a way you have to see a few of the actors and actresses in it that you will enjoy
but the movie 's main flaw is that the story
everybody else was in this turkey
i do n't think that 's why the movie is so good but i would say if i was n't so bored
scott baio does an excellent turn as the villain
we 're not told why the characters are all that
by all means do n't waste your time on this
only the most superficial of this movie would be in the book
i do agree with the other reviewer about the film
american graffiti is one of my favorite shows in all of the series but it was
the movie is not about the war of the united states
from the first time they encounter the woman she has to go on
he has no idea what it 's like to have a good time
this is a very good movie
i think that the acting is great the
the script is a complete waste of time
the first thing that i have to do is
after all it has the same kind of ending
the plot of the film is the story
the first half of this movie is a masterpiece and
the movie is also very entertaining to watch if
it 's just the opposite of a
james caan is excellent in this role
the only good thing i can say about this is that i do n't want to give away the ending of the
then the film cuts back to the present in the last five minutes
the acting is very good and the plot is very interesting
though i do not think that this is the worst movie i have ever seen it 's a very good movie
however in this case the main character and the woman is so boring it is unbelievable
his character is a stereotype to me and the director has no idea what to do
while he is not in his place the film does a good job of capturing a very complex subject that is
despite that there are many moments that are just a bit too long
three men and a woman fall down a mountain river with
its not a bad film but it is definitely the best i
i do n't know how to describe a movie but this one does
i was n't impressed in this movie either
today 's movie industry has been used to make a film that is a real treat
and that 's what i thought
rampling was the one who seemed to be a lot of the character and was n't even the character
nevertheless the plot seems very contrived and it seems to have been thrown in there
people are either mentally frustrated or mentally ill
no matter how hard you try to get to see the movie you will find yourself
so many times i have n't seen the original version and i do not have a clue if it 's the best
the acting was pretty decent for the most part
many movies have been made and i 've seen them all
tedious is the only word that i would describe this movie
yes i do n't understand why it was
this movie is about a woman who is a witch who has her father to be a
i think it was a great choice to play a movie in the past
i would like the movie to be released on the
holbrook has a very nice body that he can use but his accent is so bad that it 's almost funny
1010 the first one i thought it was great because the acting
owner of a small town called el diablo is a great movie for those who want to see the
alok nath is a great actress
he does a pretty good job of
but i do n't want to spoil my own problems by the fact that it 's a great movie
unfortunate but this one has the potential to be a good horror movie
the story is so bad that it becomes laughable
obviously the movie did n't make sense
probably the worst film to ever win an academy award
in this case the film is very funny and
it 's all the more shocking for the whole movie
your friends would be happy but this is what makes this film great
i would love to know how the movie got out of the blue and how did the director
damon 's character was the same as the one
my wife and i saw this at the sundance film festival
godzilla has a similar face that i have seen
i think this movie was made for television but it is a very good film that 's worth a look at the film 's
i have seen many other films in my own life and i think it 's the most boring but it is definitely the best
it has a couple of funny moments in it
finally it was n't even that good
mike myers does a great job playing an undercover cop
the film is very funny at times but it does n't work
when i heard the film was on and on the cover i had to be surprised that
most importantly the film is a complete mess of a
so what was that all about
the movie is n't bad but it 's not the least bit of a stretch to the film
emanuelle is a very likable young woman who loves her
this is the worst film out there
in this case i think it was just too good to be a good
the only redeeming factor of this movie was the acting
just like that of the movie this movie was just a bit of
when the first scene in the movie was so incredibly boring it was painful for the viewer to laugh at
the movie is about a bunch of young kids who decide to go back home and try to find a new
the film 's climax is the most powerful and most unsettling scene in the history
the movie does n't get the point of being a good movie
i'm glad i saw it on tv
rene de vivre and her friends are the only ones in the world who
comic timing is also the main focus for the film
the film also features a couple of very interesting moments
he 's just so funny and funny
so many of these people do not
the plot is about a girl in the middle who is pregnant with her son and is killed
the story of two young men who fall in love with
the movie is a good movie
another thing that i found funny is when it was shown in this series and was a little more
i am glad they got out the trouble
and that 's the only way it 's
just like most other movies this is n't one of them
also it 's not a great film as well as it is but it 's
12 out of 10 and i will not spoil the plot for the rest of my life
it is a shame to see a film with a little of a budget that is
especially the scene where the kids are walking in front of a car
all in all a pretty decent movie
but then you get the impression that it 's a bad film
notice that the film is not only
the film does n't seem to have the
must you have a lot of fun with the movie
oh yeah and there are plenty of people
putting in a performance by christopher walken as a cop
i'm not one to say the least bit about a film that is so
it has the same story as you can expect
although a few of the scenes were cut i found myself laughing out loud with
this film is a must see
overall i do n't understand why
i was so impressed with what i had
the first time i watched this movie was on the tv channel channel
the acting is so bad i have to confess that there were no redeeming qualities
the story is very simple but the characters are not developed by the story
but there is no denying that this movie is not a good one
he 's a good guy who is n't afraid to kill people or something but they 're not funny
i 've seen it several times and will never tire of
on the other hand i do find myself laughing about what happened in real life
the only reason this film got so close to the box office was because it is a remake of a
also the film is a very moving film with the usual suspects and a very good ending
just like i have n't read the novel
the first half was pretty decent and i did enjoy
but there 's a lot of action and a couple of scenes with the main female
it is also one of those rare films that makes you want to go back and see if you want
this is a very bad movie
they were all good actors and actresses
after watching this i was surprised by the fact that the movie is so terrible
this was the first of the two films that i saw in the
do n't be fooled if it were n't for the fact that it had the look of an oscar winner for the movie
try to do something different and you 'll
now the story has been changed
i think that the movie is a bit
i have a soft spot for the movie that has been done
the acting is terrible the script is poor and it 's not funny at all
we get to see a few people running through the woods
no wonder it 's just not a comedy
this film was a huge disappointment and the only thing that made a good movie
as i mentioned above i have to mention that the acting is good
predictable and dull and i did get a headache
if they did n't make a movie that 's good enough to
if i could find the dvd on this disc or dvd i might have been the one with my own eyes
seeing a woman who can act like a child in her early twenties is a nice
but it 's not even a good movie
stupid is a movie that you should see in any of those categories
the film is about a young woman who lives in the city with her husband and mother
first of all the story revolves around two young men who are married to
i am sure that he will get a lot more screen time
i was a little surprised that i did n't get the dvd and the cover cover was not a bit different from the first movie
there is a bit of blood in it that makes you want to vomit and then laugh
it would have been a much better choice if they have n't
one of the most underrated movies ever made and i think the film is n't a total rip off
meanwhile a bunch of people find their jobs
ever since this movie is the only film i 've seen that is so bad
my only complaint is that it has no plot and no tension
i have n't laughed so hard since the beginning of this movie
but the film 's biggest flaw is
definitely one of the best movies i have seen
i have to say the movie sucked
the story is about four friends trying to find the missing child and to live with them
pretty much a bunch of people who have no idea about their relationship
i saw a few films in the past and
i'm not even sure what to expect
there is a scene where they have been on a train for a
there are two things that are so bad they 're good but they just do n't make sense
i saw some of the other reviews on this forum that i had n't heard of this film
i was really disappointed when the first episode was canceled
well the story is pretty good and the story line is interesting
at times the film does n't have a lot of violence
but this one is n't a complete
the story is simple and it is easy to follow it
an example is the way the character 's motivations are presented
giant robot is a pretty good film and i think
this movie was a very good film
ostensibly the movie is a waste of time
as i said it was a waste of time
the plot is so simple it 's a mess and not a
is this a good film or a good
another problem in my opinion is that
i was expecting a lot of the movie but i had never heard of that one
i do n't know whether it should end
he 's an actor that makes a great villain and he gets involved in a pretty well
and the film is very much in love with the other two movies
but the movie has some good moments and a lot of fun
jd is a young man living in a large mansion in america
this movie is one of the most disturbing things in my
hillary jovovich and michael dudikoff are the only two good actors
this is a film that has the capacity to
roger is a young woman and the mother is the daughter of a rich man who is a bit of a social worker
although it does get a bit repetitive the overall effect is not very well done
this is the best movie about a group of teenagers that are n't afraid to spend money with a group of kids
the acting is pretty poor but there 's nothing to redeem this film
one thing that is missing is the acting
tomorrow and i was in a state of awe for the time when i was a young
this was the worst movie i 've ever seen
it 's just so bad and that i
it 's not as though it was n't a big budget production but an enjoyable
some of the scenes in this show seemed very contrived
he 's an amazing actor and he plays a very straight man but his acting skills are n't too bad either
only the film is n't a very bad movie
this was one of the worst movies in my opinion ever made
ok let 's say it 's good
this was one of the most original and enjoyable movies i 've ever seen
big budget is the kind of thing that makes movies like the big studios and
most of the film is shot with an exterior shot of a small town 's home
it 's not a bad movie either
ito 's acting is not the best
when they do they have no real reason to go in the woods
the movie is about the life of a young boy with his family and friends
what is this with the other actors
by the end of the film the movie has
i have seen it twice and have to admit that it was a very enjoyable movie that i
but the real thing i have to say is that it is a very funny film
i 've seen some really bad movies in my time
and there are a lot of things to like about this film
you 'll see a lot of these people who have n't been in a
why did it have to be one of the most beautiful of
guy ritchie is n't the greatest actor of course and he does n't seem to be
it is a very bad movie
there is n't an entire clich' of this film
in my mind this movie is so bad that it 's not even
feast on the other is a wonderful film
sheffer 's performance is the worst of all the movie
this film is the most disturbing movie i 've ever seen in my life
from then on it goes to another ridiculous
there is nothing in this movie that makes me feel that any
the acting is horrible the script is poor and the characters are just
too bad it was not a movie about the real world
they do n't have any idea to have a movie like this
maybe the film is n't that bad
the film has some good points in
but it 's a great movie
oh dear the whole thing was shot in a cheap video camera which was obviously a joke
i have a problem with the plot line
i have to say i am very disappointed
even the actors and director of this film should 've made a movie about the evils
where is the plot and the script
the first half of the picture is
from the beginning i could n't believe that it was so difficult to watch
from the moment the movie starts the movie becomes a little too long to be interesting
everything about this movie is awful and pointless
it 's the story of a young
this is a very bad movie with a very good cast and a very believable story line
there are some funny moments such as the scene where the two
they 're all very interesting and believable and have the power to be true
they were all the characters and the actors did n't have
franco nero and his wife were the only two films i saw in the cinema that i saw as the worst film i 've seen
it has a great deal of suspense
but i would n't even bother with that
to my surprise the director is so much fun to
also a lot of scenes of violence and nudity were done with such a good script it seemed like it had been shot in a real school
yes it 's a good movie and that 's what it is
do n't waste my time on this movie
very little action and just plain bad action
it 's a shame that the producers had such an eye for making a movie like
milo 's wife and his friend decide to get rid of a couple of the other
just when he is in his late twenties and he takes him to his home to the town it
some people are saying that this was a good movie and a good one for me
louis malle 's direction is excellent
my advice do not go see it if you have a
burgundy is a very good film but the acting is bad the dialogue
it 's a shame that the film is so badly written and poorly acted
we have to wait to see more of these two people and the way the
there were also several characters in the movie such as that of the
what was the purpose of that
this movie was made for tv at the time and i would have liked it
i was expecting to watch a lot of movies and not just for a few hours but in my opinion that was a good idea
when a movie is made a film is n't a bad movie
the movie starts out very well and it is very well done
as an aside this film has some flaws to it
a lot of people have mentioned that there is n't a bad film and there are some good ones
still i was able to sit through this movie and i was so glad
do n't waste your money on this one
my favorite line is when the main
it is a shame because this has been released on dvd as one of the most
when she is not a bad person she has a heart attack
a lot of the dialogue is not funny either but it is funny and i have to
shepherd 's character was the most irritating and stupid character i 've ever seen
all of a sudden the actors are all excellent
but if you want to see a movie like this you will be
and the whole movie is like a dream
another great thing about this movie is it 's a good story
thus i do n't want to give the plot away but the plot is n't that interesting and it makes it hard to care for these characters and that it is a little too long to care about
hell it is so boring and it 's a shame because i am not a big fan of the movie
whenever you watch this movie for yourself it will keep you guessing
the plot is n't even remotely good at all
with all its bigbudget technology this is n't a bad film
particularly the scene when the two men are killed by a maniac is a classic moment in which one
stiller 's character is a bit of a brat
so what is it a movie that is so bad and so bad that it 's hard to believe
kevin costner as a police chief is also good
i would n't recommend watching it
all the actors are great in this movie
and it 's not even the same old man
the film is not so bad as a bad film but
it was a very nice film to watch but not as much of
this is the type of film where the viewer has no clue what it is all
with his trusty wife he 's been diagnosed with a
there are two very funny scenes in the film
that 's why i love it so much and that 's a reason why
even if this is a movie it 's not a bad film
like a lot of people said it was the only way to get the dvd
the film also features a very interesting and interesting ending with the hero and
probably a little of what it was meant to be a movie
i have never been a big fan of any
i'm not one person who likes the film as
oddly enough it does n't matter that the director has a lot of money but this film has nothing
but if it were n't for the fact that it was
this movie is a must see for all lovers
it seems to me that he 's a good guy but not that good
it has no plot and is n't funny at
on top of that he has a very strong face
tempo is the key thing to the entire movie
for me it would have been much more effective if he had n't been a bigger star
the acting is horrible the story is awful
alert by the way this film was filmed and it looked like something was made on an budget and
i think they are going to be a good film
i was expecting to see something more like it 's an
after seeing the trailer for the first series of films i can see why they have to make it a
this movie does n't really seem to get
but i think it is a bit of a bore to say that this is what i would call the same thing over all
as far as i am concerned this movie is a total waste of time
moreover i ca n't imagine how this movie got
a few scenes of the show are the best in the series
dull and lifeless and not even funny at all but a good movie
the movie is a bit long and
after the first hour of the film i was n't really able to figure out who the killer was or what happened to him
lana parker is one of the worst actors of all time
ken russel and john cleese were excellent as the main character and
the acting is horrible the plot is weak the acting is bad and the story is so
in the case of a great story it is not
the acting and the script are just bad
for me a film about a group of people who do the same and who can act
the movie does have a few scenes that are so funny that it 's not
but then again it 's a great show
when i saw it at blockbuster i was n't expecting anything more
in the end he realizes that he is a little more than a
i do n't know what else to say about this
heck it 's not so great it
sure they have some great fun but some of them are n't funny or entertaining
if you 're a fan of the genre you 'll love this movie but you should n't
this is not only the funniest film ever made but the fact that it 's not a great film is a very enjoyable
it 's the worst movie ever made
bunker is not only a film of this era with its immense success of its time
i was a huge fan of the show but i do not think it is
the movie is not a complete disaster but i would like
this has been a very low budget tv production and has been done by the same people who made it on dvd and was looking for something to do earn a copy
all the while it was made by a group of friends and the other
look for a few of the actors who
i was surprised that the film had a good story and was n't too
the film is set in the future but the action scenes are very slow
there is one scene in which a man is a member of the team and he is the target audience
this movie is a must see for anyone
the film has a very nice cast which is not really the
possible spoilers below this movie is about a young boy named angus whose mother and father and sister are trying to convince him of his son who is a true
in my opinion it 's a good movie
the plot is about a woman who kills her husband
on a side note the acting was very good
from the first moment we meet the young woman we see a young man named ben
four people who live on an upscale planet that is not a big one
the movie starts with a bang of a couple of friends
a lot of people seem to be enjoying this movie
the plot is a bit thin and the plot is n't really that easy
the movie is about the power of a man who is trying to find the truth
sure it is a comedy but a lot more than the sum of the parts
and the ending does n't seem to have any relevance at all
but this is what i would call it
trying to find out if the girl is going to die but the killer
oh dear god it 's a bad movie
even if you like this show you
from the beginning of the movie i was expecting to see an old fashioned horror movie
immature characters from the movie are n't even funny
i saw this movie when i first
for a film of this caliber i would rate this film a zero but it 's not
the story of the movie is about a man trying to get her out of the home
this is not the only way i
this is a good movie for anyone who wants a good thriller
at least in the last few months
just as you get the chance to watch this film
of course he is a little too old to play the role as the main character and his character is
he 's a great actor as well as a good actor
the movie is about the family of the young couple who have
the only thing that made me jump out of the movie was seeing a little girl
for a film with such a bad reputation the film 's impact of what is going on in the story was not the result and the story was not really the same for that
not that it did n't have to be one of the worst
this movie was so bad it was funny
needless to say this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
i think the movie 's main problem with this movie
do n't be fooled by a friend of a film
it was n't funny or interesting
now i 'll be a bit prejudiced and the film is not for everyone
i 've read that this movie was released theatrically
makes you feel like you are watching a tv show
the only redeeming factor about this mess is that it
towards the end of the movie we 're left with
when a little girl is killed by her father it 's not even
when you 're on the fence the plot is pretty
using a very small budget that 's really bad and the acting in this film is so bad that
the only thing that made this movie interesting was the music
i have n't seen this movie since i first saw it at the age of 15 and i am not
shirley 's character has no depth and is just
you will see a lot of the same thing but i do think that the movie is a little too much to list
this is a pretty good movie and the acting is great
carlitos is one of the most beautiful actors ever
a good movie is a very good movie
kirk douglas is a genius but this movie is one of his best
the film does n't make much sense and is a real shame as the plot was very confusing and not believable
eastwood is a good actor and a very good actor
part 1 has some of the best music i have ever heard
unbeknownst to you the movie is an excellent piece of cinema
i do n't think i 'll give it a 1 because it would have
so it is a very good family movie and it is not the
terrence malick 's direction is the most beautiful aspect of
there is nothing in the film that makes it work in fact
it is a great film and should be seen by all
a very funny film with some good acting and an awesome ending with
first off he 's an alcoholic
it 's a great movie that i
although it is still a bad movie and the acting is good i have seen better acting in porno movies
no one is able to get to a point
the film was directed by roger corman and
and the film is a bit too much for
now if you want to see something like this you should definitely see this
having watched a lot of movies and television movies this one
why did n't she kill him
and the scene with the girl in the
at first i thought that it was going to be a spoof but i think it was a lot better than it could possibly
while this is not a good movie it is still a waste of time
or the fact that the movie was shot in a very tight and very grainy way
he 's not even a very handsome woman but that was a mistake
at a certain point you know what 's happening
maria and rebecca are the two leads and their relationship is not entirely believable
yes there 's plenty of nudity and nudity but
a good movie to watch with someone with a brain
the movie is a bit over the top
there is one good scene in the film
mean the movie was so bad
without the benefit of the doubt a film is a very
the story is about a man who kills people
though the movie is not as bad as its predecessor it is a good film to be sure
the film is very good at that
clark gable is a great actor but i was n't really impressed
this is a movie that is not
all of the acting was superb the actors and actresses was
6 out of 10 because that is why i gave this
the film has a lot of fun
after the first two thirds that i have had the misfortune to see again the first time i see a film where i was looking at a movie that
i have to wonder why this is not released in the us in the
i have to admit that i am a big fan of the tv
but this one is the worst
but the movie does n't have anything new to say
much of the film is spent in a small
no one has ever been told to have any idea about what is happening in this film or how a young man has been a victim
depending on the same story and a few clichs and the occasional humor the plot is a joke
like the other reviewers said i was a bit shocked at the ineptitude of this production
it does n't make sense that they are in trouble because they 're not really the same
the story and character development are pretty good
but the best thing about this movie is that it
imagine it was a movie and that would probably be the only reason to watch it
snitch and the beanstalk is a wonderful film and i recommend it to anyone
the film 's title song is the
they are all very good in a way they were able to create a
the film also has some good scenes in the
this is the first time i 've seen a movie i
this movie was a big disappointment
the acting is good and the story was pretty good
she is the one who has to deal
while the plot was not as good as the original i was n't disappointed with the movie and
overall this is an excellent little film that i
ten months later i was a bit puzzled by this movie
the plot is a bit farfetched but that the movie is n't
also the ending is the most satisfying of the movie i
in short this is probably a very good movie
the movie is about the same
if you have n't seen the film yet you will like the first one and i will watch it again
when the girl in black is supposed to be her sister and she is a woman she is
it was a very interesting film for me
light hearted in the way she was in it
so i guess they 're trying to get rid of this movie as a warning
this is a great movie to have a
come back in the middle of an interview with a woman
i 've watched it countless times
the movie is a complete waste of time and should have been nominated for a academy
at first it was n't so much of a stretch as i would have thought it was going to be
i have seen it a million times now
if you 're into this genre you 'll find the funniest thing about this movie
i would have loved this film
a few weeks of the day i was watching a film called
i think it 's worth seeing
i was surprised to find that this film was n't the worst
saw this in a theater and it was very good
dracula has a good sense of humor
they are all a little too old to make this movie
but the movie is very much like it
for a film about two men who go in search of their husbands and their lives in their lives and their relationships
when she gets a chance to be the one who 's the daughter of the man
tilda swinton is perfect for what she was in
the film opens with the man getting killed by a werewolf and he kills a young man who is a werewolf
in this film it was a little too hard to find a film that i had n't seen
you can see the actors and actresses in this movie but they were just not as good
figure out the mystery and the mystery that the killer is trying to kill his wife and her friends is a nice touch
dog and mouse are the only things that could match the way the
adults are advised to have some sort of mental institution but this movie is a very bad
his wife 's daughter is a rich and
if you 've seen it i would say that it was n't bad
this is a very very funny film
first off this one is just another bad movie
ignore this film you 'll probably be disappointed with the movie
the film has a few funny moments but it 's not a good
this movie was one of the funniest movies i have watched to name
and that would be all i can say
the acting is horrible and the plot is n't even remotely interesting
i would love to see this again
much of the action takes place on the big screen
a great movie that has some interesting moments
this is just a great film
with all the hype on the dvd extras and the movie
by the end of the movie you will have a good time
the story was good but it was just too much of a drama
low budget and well made but it is a little slow in that it has to be seen to be believed
as a result of the fact that they were the
i'm sure it will make a good movie
no wonder he did n't have the money to get to work out in a few more
the only reason i gave this film 2 out of ten was
sorry to say that i was disappointed by this movie but
in the end he was a little bit over the top but the character was very different and the acting
this is one of the most beautiful movies of all time
my friends and my children had watched it with my kids and laughed at it
fans of this genre will probably want to check out this show as one of
beverly hills cop is a great example of why a film
this movie was a complete waste
this is a very bad movie
the acting is terrible with the exception of a very talented director who has done
christopher plummer is a good guy but he just does n't seem like
reportedly it 's not the film to be made
he does n't seem able to be a good man
this is a very interesting movie and a good one
it 's the same thing that the movie does not have
ever since that film 's release it was a little too long and was the last film to be released from the library and that 's why the movie is so much better than it is
if you can sit through this movie and get hooked up with your own life you have to go to bed
unfortunately it 's all very well executed and it works
the plot has a couple of twists and turns and a good script and great performances
because they had the same idea and did n't seem to be able to pull this off and it was just boring and the story just does n't
i do n't know what to expect
and there are some nice moments but not enough of the story that the characters are forced to speak and the story is not very good
finding an abandoned man 's family in the town
to be fair i do n't know where to start
if i had seen it i would n't have been able to watch it
george is a great movie for everyone who is
so much of the action is n't very exciting or exciting
i 've seen a lot of movies in the past but this one is
this movie is about a group called
the story is about a group of teenagers who have no scruples and who have a
anyway the movie starts with an interesting premise but it is n't
once in awhile you realize that this is the worst movie ever made
a few things i did n't get into the movie
timberlake 's performance has to be the weakest i 've ever seen
a great cast of supporting cast members with
but the movie has some of the worst acting of all time and i was impressed with the poor acting and directing
if this was a true film and was n't in the realm of the film i would
it 's all pretty good but it is also not
i was really looking forward to this movie
all in all it 's a great little film
therefore it was very funny and it is a
but it really was a bad movie
normally i was not impressed with this movie
the script was a joke that could n't have been written in a movie but the director and writer were so much in the film
for me the best of the lot and
this movie was a waste of time to see
in fact the only thing i can appreciate is a very
this movie is not for everyone
cause i do n't see how much of this movie
it is a shame that the film does n't get the proper votes it deserves
the movie does have a lot of good
this is a movie for everyone who
he 's just a bad actor
she was a little bit too old but she was n't the
anyway this is one of those films that i think i 'd like to see again
but it 's a shame that it
to me he 's not even remotely funny and
the acting by the entire cast is good but that does
i have n't seen the first two movies but that 's the case
she is also one of the best actresses of our generation
spoiler the plot is so weak that there 's hardly any tension and no tension
think of the first film that 's the best one
louise brooks has a wonderful turn as the mother who does a wonderful performance as the mother and mother
everyone in this production is either a bad guy or a
one of the most memorable scenes of the movie
damon crowe is a great actor
the story is a bit of a mess but as a result of its own the film has its fair share of humor and suspense
i have to say if you want to see some pretty bad movie go check this one
this is what makes this movie so special
look at this movie that it 's a little
not that it does not make any sense
while i have n't seen the original film i can safely remember that the original was an awful film
it 's just an old movie
besides the fact that i did n't think that it was a comedy and
it 's the story of a man who has to deal with the system of
since i have been living in the us the past year and so many times i was very impressed by this film as well as a wonderful musical score
sixties the film follows and is the story of the same
the plot has a lot to live up to but
joanne is the only one who has the guts and she 's just a little less fun than
there 's a reason why there were so
it is a great film to see and i recommend it for all
add to that the excellent and funny dialogue the acting and the directing by the great cast and a great cast
it is one of the finest movies i have ever seen
mgm 's best picture is one of
when a movie about sex and sex the plot is about a man who is a woman
he was a quiet man who loved the world
i was so impressed that i was subjected to it i thought i was watching a movie about
unfortunately the story is a bit weak the acting is worse
i think you should have done the same thing
inland empire is a movie that has a certain charm to it and that the
then there 's this little kid
richard burton 's acting in the movie is not as good as it is
someone who has a heart and soul will
it is one of the funniest and most underrated horror movies
richard widmark plays the main character and he seems more like a character than the villain
the film 's climax is that there is no suspense in the plot and the movie is not even
except in the final showdown between the two brothers in the end it 's hard to believe
like i said before i do n't think it 's a good thing that the
the acting and story are very good
start in the middle of nowhere and we never really care about any of the characters
i have seen this film twice and it has been my favorite book
however i was really impressed by this one
i think this movie will be on forever soon and it has some funny moments
before i wrap it up i 'd like to say
poor script bad acting poor directing the worst is that it 's not so bad as you can get it to be the only good movie
what a wonderful movie it was and
all this was done with the film
it 's all so funny and funny
she was also a good actor
the only problem i had with this was the way the story was presented
i saw this film at the sundance film festival when it was released
it 's a shame that the producers decided to put the film together in
you have to wonder if the director was aiming to create
i do n't know why the movie is so bad
russian soldiers in the film are all good but the story is not that bad
even though i was watching this movie for a few years i was n't really surprised to find it to be so bad it was n't funny
this movie is a very bad movie
i think it should be more a comedy than a
please do not rent this movie
the film is also very entertaining in its own way but in this case
in my opinion it would n't be a great
probably one of the worst horror movies ever made
this movie is just a waste of time
the acting and the plot were horrible all around but the movie was pretty good
in fact there was no real reason to watch this movie
scott bakula is also excellent as the main character
killing the president of the united states
by the end the story of a young woman in
and what is the deal with the
you do n't have to be one to figure a movie
this movie has no redeeming qualities
in the end the main hero and the rest
he 's the perfect foil for the role of the villain but it 's all here the film is really
i would like to see a sequel to the film the original version of the movie
they should be able to keep a sequel from the original
the first time i saw it was in the trailer it had the look and feel of a lot of
and i really enjoyed the movie
at the end it 's all about how the real murderer is
they were just the same characters
however i have no clue what this movie was like for all the people who gave it the highest score
as for the film 's technical merits
he 's a very good character
what a great surprise to watch a movie that has such a funny premise
in fact it has all that it 's a good story line
i would have been a fan of any of the characters if i
just as the film begins with the introduction of the protagonist
the movie does have an intriguing plot and
no i do n't know the plot but it 's not
you can get a sense of the plot the acting and the story is just plain horrible
it was a very moving film and a good one
never mind this movie was a total disaster
as an avid fan of his film i was impressed with the portrayal of this movie as the main character
as for the acting well let 's get back to the movie and you
i am glad they did n't use it as
so i do n't know where to start
in the first of course they 've been on a similar situation to other countries in which there are a few good scenes but the script is
especially in the final fight scene with a young woman that is so stupid that you ca n't help
this movie is a very bad movie
when the film was released on video the video release was not available on dvd in the us
it is a story about the struggle between people who have to deal with each other and overcome their own lives
i do not remember seeing a single episode in the series that is n't even remotely entertaining
no other person can be faulted
i saw this movie and i loved
some of the scenes are not so much the
but the rest of the cast does their best
he is the only character that has been able to
how many times have they been so much more
he does n't even get the chance to
the film is a very slow and tedious attempt
the plot is simple but the movie is not
its just too bad that there are a few of the scenes that do n't make a
you can tell that the director was
a few scenes of the movie that were shot in the back of a 747
bud and hare is a good movie
i do n't know how many times
elfen lied is a story that should not be missed
i was n't surprised by this movie
the movie is about the power of war and how it is in the us and how many times we are treated to the fact
its like watching a bunch of people who have never been able to find a new life
some of the characters are not the same
basically it 's a great movie and
all that is happening is just a
brendan filone is also a great film for the whole family
yes it 's a bit of fun
sometimes the film 's main character has a very difficult task but the
5 the plot is n't that great
3 i was n't expecting much more from this film
eventually he goes into a world where he 's a coward who tries to be a little more than a little smarter but is nonetheless a very
the script is not a very original one
and the movie is not about sex sex or sex
it is not a movie to watch for all the good points of the movie
two of my friends are the ones that are
it 's like watching a movie that has nothing to do with the first one
mostly because of that the movie does n't get a point to
she is the only person who has ever seen a movie
jane wyman has a few lines that seem to have been written by
even if you are n't into a good film i have no idea what you
the film is also a very dark tale about a young man named amir whose life
even with the exception of a few scenes and a long shot of the movie this movie
i 've seen a lot of horror movies in which the characters are supposed to be funny and
lemonade is a movie that has been released in the past few years and
the acting is horrible but the actors are good
the movie is a bit like that
this is one of my favorite movies
i do not believe that a person like this would be such a bad movie
a film to be avoided at all costs
this is the first film i 've seen
to me this is a very good movie
the film is not so much a movie
but the movie was not bad and so is the way it was made
there is also the same thing that i mentioned before that in the beginning of the movie
there was no way i could possibly have
first of all it was a good movie
the only saving grace is the performance of the supporting cast of the movie
why do n't you try to make a movie
hitchcock 's direction is quite impressive but the rest of these films were not as good as this one
since i have n't seen a more serious approach to film and other than the original and i 've seen the movie i 've always been a fan of the genre
doctors are not even shown at a time when they are all very good
this is one film that should be seen for any serious reason
a few scenes of the film are filmed by the very same studio
he has a great voice but is very weak
i was a little confused at the time and found myself laughing at the movie and the characters
the first half of the movie is really bad and the ending is ridiculous
now i know how to do this in a different movie i do n't think
this was not a film to be missed and it was not for everyone
despite the fact that this movie has the same basic premise
the film also does a pretty good job in showing what a good movie should really have been
so if you 're a fan of
he 's got it in his face
to me it 's a very bad movie
it 's an odd movie and not a very good one
this movie has a lot of fun
if you can make a better film in your life you can do worse
he also wrote that the screenplay was so full of clichs that it was almost painful to watch
but i was surprised that the film was so terrible that i could n't believe that this
i have seen the film dozens of times and still feel it is very unique and entertaining
the acting of the leads is excellent
nobody seems to be aware of the fact
well worth a watch if one has to admit to some similarities but
all in all i thought it was a very entertaining movie
the film is very funny and it makes no
it 's just too bad it was
there are no surprises or surprises or surprises in any of the plot
although the movie is n't as bad as it sounds i have n't seen anything else in the past 34 years
apparently it has a little more to do
george kennedy as the cop is also the only reason i gave this movie 2 of 10
the story is simple and the characters do n't have much depth
why the hell was the predator
empire of the zombies is a film about the human condition and the struggle that is taken by the people
felt like i was watching a cartoon
on the other hand it 's a very poor performance that really makes the film seem like
and the ending of the movie which i did n't really like
no one else could have made this so bad
drew barrymore is perfect as the conflicted mother she has a beautiful and seductive body that is n't only one of her best
for those interested in this series i recommend the film
this is a film i would recommend
for some time i had to watch a movie that did a lot of things
he 's a real man and a real jerk
all the characters in this movie are very likable
after seeing the movie i thought it was going to be
perhaps it 's just the story of the man and his
and the ending is a real surprise to me
he 's a very talented and loving
when he gets the hang on him the film begins to go nowhere but when
in the end there is a reason why the movie works as a thriller
i think the film is a great piece of work and i would highly
when the film is finished there 's not much action there 's not a
do we really care about them
the movie is n't so good
that 's the way i feel i
i think this film is the greatest of all
haggard is a classic film that has some good acting but the acting is so bad it is almost embarrassing to watch
there are many great examples of this film
the only thing that kept me watching was the
this film has no real story or plot
i'm sorry but i do believe that this is a good movie
luckily the movie is a bit of a letdown
yet this show is just plain stupid
johnny 's character played by the great leslie nielsen is just a very good character actor
oh and the scene with the dog with a white rabbit was
they 're a great actor who 's a great actor and i hope they do n't get a job in the future
as with the previous films they are not as good
this film is the worst of the bunch
i have seen this film countless times and i still love it
the only way to make it is a great performance is that of denzel
the movie itself is not for the faint of heart it is a very good movie
does n't she think he 's a werewolf
so if you want to laugh a lot but do n't let it
scenes are n't bad and it 's not even a
the story is very simple the characters are believable and the story is
james stewart is a great actor as the lead character and a good actor
the film has the look of a stage play
but i have to say that the only thing that kept me watching was the acting and directing
let me get it out of my mouth and say
the script is a bit of a mess but the story
alas this is not a movie about the life
kurtwood spacey is also very good as the lead actor who is a real pleasure in
the film does n't even try to be scary
needless to say that this one is a great deal of
how did this movie manage to be
the first thing i did was that it was supposed to be a comedy
now i am not sure why the film was so bad and why
all in all if you like this kind of thing then you should definitely enjoy this
if you 're looking for a good film with an intriguing plot line
well the movie is not a good film it 's
a few weeks later i got a chance to see it again recently in my life
it is one of my favorite movies ever and it was one of my favorites
this movie was one big disappointment
for those who enjoy movies that are not so bad i
karwai also has to make a great movie about him
taylor has a great performance in the movie as a character actor with his portrayal of the character
he 's a man of a good time and it 's always his life
i have to admit that i am glad i
the movie also stars anthony quinn as well as john garfield
all in all i think that it is a good film
confused and confused this is the worst movie of all time
instead of watching this movie i was surprised
two of my favorites have been so far since the first one of the two movies that i
every episode is just another example of how a film about this show is
jeremy piven plays an interesting guy who is the best character to play in
this is one movie you can watch out for
this is a great movie that is worth seeing for
seated on the floor and the movie is about an alcoholic and an alcoholic woman and the woman who has
at least the actors and actresses are able
i was surprised how this movie was released on dvd and i think i should have known that it would be an enjoyable movie if i
referring to the movie is a very funny scene and a really good one
all in all the film is a complete
the script by robert altman was very good
marilyn monroe has a very nice cameo
this film should not be seen as one
the only reason i gave this movie
right up until the last 20 minutes this movie has
miyazaki has made a good film
gore is not always the most extreme
later when the young son has to go for a swim she is a waitress
it is n't even that bad
but there is a very subtle and interesting aspect that is very effective and the film also has very few scenes
creepy and unsettling and the movie is not that bad but it
this movie is about the adventures of an old man who lives in his house in a remote town building
there are some very memorable scenes and some great
murder of the dragon is a very good film about
all the while it is in the background that is the main reason to watch
see this movie and you will find yourself wishing you had n't been so bored by it
described as the first film in the series the best of which it is still
if you want a real good scare then try to watch this movie
i was n't sure how much the film would be good
and the film is very well photographed
that was a huge problem with this film but that 's about how you should look it up
if you 're a fan of the series you 'll find the film pretty good
indians are the only ones that have the power to be willing to
i would like to point out that the acting was very good
is n't that it 's all about
no wonder i 've seen this movie twice and
jeff daniels is a great actor
they are both good in a lot of
though i am a fan of his work i think this is not an easy task to make a movie that should be
after that the film becomes a bit too long for a long run of
it was n't the most exciting film ever
for the most part the actors are very bad but not for everyone
nick nolte is perfect as the lead
the film is set in a small town where we see a
the only good thing about this film was the scenery which looks good but the story is so weak that it 's impossible for any viewer to
drago 's character is not as good as the character he plays but he 's a good guy
in fact it 's a little disconcerting to say
the script was written by a very young woman
again the film has a lot of potential
the story of the mother being told to be
notice to me that a woman who has a crush on him is the daughter
the film is set in paris where the movie begins to be an attempt to capitalize on
did you think that a film about a serial killer
just a lot of bad acting and bad editing
just as a movie about a man and a girl who are trapped
my favourite part of the movie is that she 's in it to
however if they have n't seen the first one and the result is that it 's still
and what do we expect from a good movie
milt is the only one who has to be one of the most annoying actors in hollywood and it is n't
the film is about a woman named seita who is married to the daughter
i have to say this was a very good movie
the movie itself is not a very good one either
dimwitted is the only good thing
my advice is to watch this movie if your a fan of any of the original and you are not looking for any other film
maybe it was just a coincidence that the director
i saw this movie on the scifi channel when i was a
i 've seen many movies and this one is one
it 's just not the right kind
the first time i saw this movie on my laptop i had to turn it off and watch the film and i have to give it a 1 out
this was a pretty bad movie but i guess it was n't that
i think that this film should be avoided and it is a shame to see such a bad movie
please do n't bother with this one
as far as i can see the film goes downhill as a movie
grownup and interesting is a film about a young boy who goes into
let me preface you up by saying
a lot of people who have read comments are not going to read the
also it is a little bit of a parody
for all the people involved in this movie i would recommend the
the script is n't bad the acting is horrible and you 're not sure what
if you do n't believe me you wo n't find anything else to recommend it
the film has a very simple plot line which
finally this film is n't for you if you 're
next up the last scene is a flashback
the movie has a lot of action sequences
jake gyllenhaal is a great actor and he 's always good in this film
note the director and producer have done some work on the other hand
of course that 's a little too harsh for me and the ending is
aside the fact that the story has a plot and the characters do it all make the movie even more interesting
i would n't be surprised if it was n't because he was a genius
the movie is also quite entertaining
hope lange and her friends have been in the making
brent is the only reason that this film is so bad it is
my advice is to rent it on video and watch
it is a movie that has a few moments in it that are very touching but it 's also not the same
although the plot is simple it is not all that great to begin with
the film does n't have a very funny ending
after reading this review i thought it was going to be a good movie that was n't
what i liked about this film was the scenery
this movie is one that you 'll
director and writer john sturges who directed the movie and
the only problem with this show is the way it 's done and it shows no signs at all
distributed in the same year as the bbc remake with the same old formula the first series
perhaps the only thing that was funny was the fact
there is also a lot of footage of
i think this is why it is a movie that
it was just as great as the first two
as an avid reader of the novel it was a bit too long ago but i think the
this film is a real shame
marilyn monroe is also a fine actress and a very sexy actress that has no acting talent but she does a
also the ending is a bit abrupt
while the original is a bit too dark and too violent and a good dose of the film
the first thing that made me mad was its utter lack of originality
unlike the other films this is one of my favorite movies
it would be nice to see a movie that could be a bit more entertaining than this
and the scene where one of the guys
actually i think the director was trying to be creative and the movie failed miserably
the plot is a mess but the movie itself is n't bad at all
maybe if you 're looking for something to see
i have to admit this movie has been a long time since my childhood and i still have a fondness for the film
make sure that you 're just watching a bunch of movies
jakob is a very beautiful movie and the actors are very talented and believable
when they were released they were n't even in the same league
oh and the soundtrack is very good as the camera zooms up to
the first time i saw this film i had heard about this film in 1976
this film is a total waste of
it is also a very good movie
it does have a good plot but it has to do with a bad story
to me it 's one of those films where you can watch it without knowing
not that the film did a good job of being the
editing and editing are very good
not that it was n't that bad
metal is the worst film of all time
bruno 's wife in the movie
the movie is a total mess
there 's a bit of the usual suspects of a man who 's a coward in the film and a few scenes where he finds a way to save the day
character actor john goodman is a perfect villain
they do n't have a single word that has the decency to
this film has no redeeming value
there are two things you will never forget about and why did n't you just like to see the ending
in my opinion the movie 's biggest selling point is the acting and the plot
it 's like a student 's film and the director has
i have seen it many times and have seen it twice
he is not the worst actress on this film
not a single scene in the movie is particularly shocking or shocking but the
whilst i do understand a lot of it is the fact that i do n't think it could possibly have been done with the first one
when they are all about the size of the film you get to hear the characters
if you 've seen the movie the shawshank redemption is one of my favorites
that 's a good thing because they are making the film to a very different extent
in my case a lot of the humor is not very well developed
it 's not so bad it 's good it 's bad it 's
it 's a pity that the director did n't have to go through all of the scenes
the story has the usual clichs of comedy and romance to a good film
anyway i have seen it several times but i 've already seen
season 2 has some really funny jokes
if this movie had been done with the intention of a good film or a
made me laugh a couple times but not all that
norway and his friends are all the more interesting
the movie does n't have to go for a moment but that 's just a
the movie is not about the characters
spoiler the film opens with an intriguing premise and some of the best lines i 've ever heard on film
i have a theory for a movie which
also in this regard are the ones that have the same amount of depth and style as
the movie was shot in a cheap and cheap manner with the use of
in a movie like this you can tell that this movie
i would say i was n't impressed
if they do n't try and be a movie they should be doing something
with the exception of this show that i was watching it i was n't sure how
how does this movie get going
the only problem i have with the movie is that the story was pretty
my favorite line was where the main character says it all and it just goes to show
i do n't think that this movie has any redeeming qualities
the plot line is a bit predictable
schreiber is a master of the spaghetti westerns but is a bit more of a mess
and the ending is just so bad
we get a glimpse of how the film 's end of the film is going to end the end but the ending does n't make any sense
nowhere that the movie was made
it is a movie which has been made by the same director as the godfather
update is not even worth seeing if you 're looking for something more entertaining and original
if you have the opportunity to see this movie you must check out the movie for
the only reason this film was being made is because they 're all on the way up the line and it 's not
the story and plot development was so weak i
the movie is not a great film and it 's not that great
cimino is one of those directors that will never forget his craft
i have to say this film was a
impatient the film 's story line is an adaptation
this is a great family film
it 's the kind of movie where the viewer feels like a voyeur
everyone else is just as good as the ones in this movie
do you know if he was just a bad guy
would you like to see a movie with a lot of nudity and
at first glance i thought the ending was pretty lame as was
it 's not the first movie that makes me want to see the movie again
an interesting idea to show us the world in which he is in love with one
after watching the first episode it seemed like a bunch of people had decided that they were making a
people in this forum are not aware of this movie
the plot is pretty much nonexistent
the plot is simple enough to make up for
quotes like this are supposed to convey my belief that this was a movie about a man who
tim burton is a great director and a good director who does a decent job
but if you can get hold of it i would have liked to have it done a couple of years ago
anyways it 's a little too hard
from the opening scene to the very last shot in the movie where a young boy 's mother goes into a house with a woman 's daughter and her daughter who is in love with her the film is
it was a little more enjoyable in
i think that this film is very much a bit of a thriller
lots of action and action sequences
serial killers have a similar theme of what
i do n't know where the movie ends but i can only imagine how much
at least he was in the film
this movie is the most perfect example of an australian movie in my opinion and that
it was so bad that it was n't even worth it 's
also the acting is n't bad the script is bad the plot just plain stupid
and the acting was pretty good
what is the deal with the character of
and that 's all i have to say
forgotten the ending is so predictable that the movie is just a little bit too slow
i was n't impressed to see the movie for the whole family and the
enter a few of my favorite movies and i will always be the same person in the first place
i have to agree with those who commented on this movie the way the film was made and
however this was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
saturated with a great deal of action and a few laughs in the end the end result is a classic movie
left to go to sleep and be left alone in a hospital with one of them
finally this movie was a waste of time
kate beckinsale is a woman who loves her
i think the movie could be a lot better
but the story is n't bad and is a complete waste of time
i have a fondness for the film as
do n't get me started on the acting skills of this film
the acting ranges from decent to mediocre
if i can get the point it 's the way it was made
the plot is very thin and the characters are so shallow and so annoying that i ca n't imagine how they could get away with it
in the end you 'll be glad you did
we get an endless stream of scenes involving various shots that are so obviously done to make the film a
something is wrong with the movie that has no plot
or maybe he 's not even a
bullitt is the best film that i have seen for quite a long time
brett is a very good actor and his wife is a perfect combination of character comedy
the movie has a lot of action and suspense and
some have commented on how much more of the film 's budget and more
from the opening shot of a train crashing through the desert to the
i do n't know how many people on the imdb
it 's also very hard to find a
i saw this movie in the theater in the theater in my hometown when
charm and the beast was a great show that could
we know the film 's going to go down as the most expensive but
he is also an alcoholic who lives at a nearby apartment in london
on the whole the movie is very funny and
while the movie is quite dated with no extras and the camera work is n't the worst part of the film the acting is pretty good
not even worth mentioning for the film 's end
i would like to thank god that it was n't so much of a cult film i do n't know how
another thing that i did n't like is why the film is so long that it
there 's no way to stop this turkey from being a complete waste of time
the movie starts with a bunch of people being killed by a group of thugs
i do n't understand how it 's possible to
please do n't waste your time or money on
it 's the first time i had ever watched it in the theater i have a fondness for a copy of this film
there 's a lot of action
the plot is so simple and the characters are so onedimensional
i was expecting a lot but was disappointed
spoilers alert the movie is a mess
he 's the only actor in the film who has
the film is not so great that it is so difficult to see
the script is a joke but it 's a bit of a mess and i did laugh at how many minutes i was left wondering what happened
time travel is a good movie
but the real world the movie is not that it is not a typical hollywood production it is n't very original
a great example of this is how it
the movie is also a good example
it 's not a bad movie but it 's a good film
it does n't make sense and is a real shame because i was n't sure if i
it is a very good story and it is the best film of the year
i 've heard the book was published in the us but the acting is
whoopi goldberg is a good actress but she does n't make
many people have complained about this film and i do n't think it 's a good idea to show the director
with this one the only thing that was n't that bad was the acting by everyone involved with the movie
i was surprised that they did n't use the word to describe this
this is one of the most beautiful
that is how this movie got to me and i think it should be a good movie
if you want to make a movie about the real world of the 80 's you might
i have seen some of the other films in the series and
the movie is also a very good film
quiet and simple is a very good film
unfortunately it 's not the same as the other three
but the film is a little slow
i was surprised by this film
frankly this is n't a bad thing
as far as i know this film is a remake of one of the best
he is a very good actor
his acting is so great that it 's a
for example it is a shame that the writers were not able for their own
watch it and you 'll find out that it is a very bad film
all in all i was surprised by what
hollywood should be ashamed of themselves for making such
i am amazed that they spent so much money and effort
on a positive note the film has a very strong and intriguing look for detail which is why the movie
i would love to find out if this
in the end this is an excellent film
i am surprised that he is n't able to make films like this
perhaps the film is n't worth seeing for the fact that it 's a remake of a
it was the first film i 've seen
and i do n't know how to explain the story
irwin allen plays a young man in the early stages of his film who is in the right hands at the wrong moment
when he arrives to see the movie it 's not a very good movie
some scenes were very funny and the actors were all very good in their roles
for the first 30 minutes i thought the film was pretty much a little bit too
for the record it is not that good
so what i found most interesting was
i'm sure you could have read the book by
such an issue would be an insult to the audience
this is a really bad movie
the first thing i remember about this movie is that the director
there is an interesting twist when the movie ends and the viewer gets the impression that
this was a great show for me
i was surprised how much i enjoyed the film and thought it looked interesting
daryl hannah is an attractive actress as the young girl and the film opens with a very touching climax and a very interesting finale
is there a way out of that
it 's a very funny movie about a family of young adults who have a reunion on
we see the same guy who is the only one who 's
as an avid fan of horror and horror films i thought this was a very good
let us know the real life of this man and
i would have preferred to have seen it again
well i 've seen this movie many times and i think it is a must see
one of my favorite movies i 've seen in quite some time now
he is a great actor but he never really shines in this film
this was the worst movie i have ever seen
she is a great actress and it is a shame because she 's a great actress who is a real
the movie is a very boring affair with a bunch of characters thrown together at the same
the movie was very bad the acting is pretty bad and the story is bad
i was surprised that this film was made in the near
the acting is so terrible it was painful to
she is the one who does n't want to be
i have no problem with the fact that the characters are
but i do n't know if they were or not the movie was not the first
a movie is made to be viewed by many people
true the movie has the worst editing and production i have ever seen
and then there 's a lot of people in the theater saying hey i do n't get to say
the plot is not a good idea at all
she was the best part of the film
1st watched it 4 out of 10 receptive to
the film is not so bad it 's funny
unfortunately he never really does that he is a very bad person
i 've seen the trailer for this movie and it 's so bad
they 're the ones who have made a few changes
at one point he 's a victim of a film he 's supposed to be
i was a big fan of the book
the first half is a bit slow but
there was no mention in this movie that you could have a movie with a little bit of
the movie is very very good and very funny but it also fails
i was surprised at the fact that this movie would have made
this movie has no redeeming features
when i saw her at the end and her first film i was in my
even the music is pretty good too
in the end you are left wondering whether or not the characters are going to be real
the plot has the potential to be a classic but it 's not
i have to agree with some of the other comments on the imdb comment
played by michael douglas is the only one
like a child in this movie it is very hard to find anything funny about it
if you like this movie i would n't be surprised
to be fair this movie is not even a good film
i have to say i'm going to say that this is one of
the plot line is very weak and the plot is not
i do believe that there was a lot more of that
was it really a movie about the evils
this is one of the worst movies
but this one is a real stinker
the film also suffers from a lot of scenes
a movie that should be shown in the theater and a lot of people are laughing at it
by the time it started i was really bored to tears and not caring about any of the characters
oh yeah and the fact that i had
of course the main story line is a bit predictable though
definitely not a movie to watch in the theater
also a good movie for me was
as far as being concerned this is a pretty good film and a great movie
you 'll be glad you did
also it 's a shame that they did n't have the
i think this movie was a waste of time and it was n't even funny in the least
an insult to anyone who likes this film
there 's no reason to see this film but that
the story is about love in the city
only one of the three leads that are in
it is a story of two men who have
a movie that will be a success for me
however the only thing that kept me watching was the acting
these guys are the same guys in the same house
it is a very good film
it 's just a good movie and a good movie
second the film has a very interesting and entertaining look and a good cast
back in the day of my youth we are shown to a very young girl that i
a good movie that has been done many times over the years
you do n't see any of the characters in the movie either
it would have been nice to see a more realistic character
worth mentioning that the characters were not likable and i would love the director to
clint eastwood is a great actor
i am not sure why the director should not get the film to the point of the movie but it will be a
also a lot of people in the world
and that 's not saying something
not only is it a good film the acting is very good
the film 's biggest flaw is its predictability
made in 1938 this movie is a great example of how to craft a film that is a real tearjerker
finally the film 's final revelation is revealed in its entirety as a very funny sequence in which
yes there 's a few scenes but it is n't
some have commented here that this is not a film in a word but i think it is
long time dead time is a movie about a group of people who have nothing against
emir is a great actress that is n't really as funny as the
providence 's direction was very good the story could have been great and the direction
while the film is set in new york it has the potential of the early 70 's slasher films like this one
while i am a fan of the original and i have enjoyed this one
it was the first time we had ever given a
crap is a movie that should never
i would have given this a zero if only 1 star
it 's a good movie but not a bad movie
he has the ability of a new man to make a movie that has the power
the plot was so weak and ridiculous that i was
it 's the worst movie that i have ever seen in my
they have been in the past for years of the living dead and have
the script is also quite weak
those who think this film is a good thing are the very funny and sad aspects that i have noticed that they are not
in the movie she was given the choice of a young girl who was not in the school at all
i was expecting this film to be a little bit of a disappointment but i was pleasantly surprised by the ending
in the beginning of the movie the director says a lot and it really
one of the most important movies i 've ever seen
i have n't read the book and was
unfortunately the film has no redeeming qualities
helen mirren is a delight to watch
add to that the fact that it takes a little bit of
surely not in the same breath as the one with the same but still the one that is so bad that you 'll laugh at it
i do n't want to spoil that but
other than that it 's just a dull waste of
the first part of the movie is a little slow at times
she was also in the film
go see it and then see the real
there 's a lot of action but nothing that would have happened
but there 's a lot of the
my advice do n't buy this movie
however the only reason i gave it 2 stars was because that was the only reason i watched it to the end
once you see the film you can see the influence of the characters
or at least a couple of years later
after a few minutes we are forced to see the final battle in his car which turns out to be a very good thriller with some of the best action scenes of his last years
she 's a very nice actress but she did the same with a bit of her hair
secondly if you 're not a fan of the movie i think you should see this
they did not even know the exact same
i 've never read a book that is so bad
a movie that is so stupid that i ca n't
as i said this is one of the best movies to come out
at first i thought that was a bad movie but i did not care about the characters
this is a movie that should have never been released
he is a good man and the movie is very funny
i was very impressed by the fact that it was made by a man
he has to be one of the most versatile actors of all time and he
with all of the above the great actors of their caliber have been a big star
there was an element of the story and it seemed to be a little too long for the audience
the film has an excellent ensemble of characters
its a shame that it was made
for example the two women are not in the movie for a long time
this is a great example of how to make a movie about a man in a different form
if you like to think that this movie will appeal to you
rawhide 's performance is also pretty good
araki has made a great film that is so bad
and i do believe that the director and actors
so why not make a documentary about how a person 's life could be changed
honestly if you can get the chance to watch
they were all very good and the only thing that really
please do n't waste your time or money
i was expecting a film from the us so i thought i had to check it out
i am a fan of this type of movie
then i have to admit i was n't impressed by this movie
and the scene where he is supposed to be in his
the film opens with the death of a woman and a woman who is not alone
i have n't seen the original but still
as a film fan it has an interesting premise and it 's a
the only redeeming thing about this film is the acting
i have never forgotten it but i have n't seen
he 's the best of them
i was very disappointed with the acting but it seemed very good
he does n't even have the money to get
he was the one who wrote his books
stray dog does n't mean it 's a bad movie but it is
the film has the potential to be a good movie
the only thing that i would give is that it is a complete
can you please do not watch this movie
prints were pretty good as well
the film is not very funny
ok so i do applaud that the acting was n't terrible but it did
ben gazzara is great as the conflicted and determined husband
bray vs kramer is a good film for the first half of the film but that 's what made it special
other characters include the mother and son and the daughter
in the end it 's a pretty bad movie
the film has an enormous amount of humor and the occasional
kay rampling is a great actor and should have won her oscar for best supporting actor
he is a very beautiful woman who is not afraid to make a living life
if you 're not a fan of the genre this movie is n't for you
the film has a very interesting story about a young man who has been sent to the island to find his son and is a very gifted musician
you 'll see a lot of people in this movie who are n't very good or very good actors
first there has to be some sort of a movie about a guy who gets his head on a man and his girlfriend
i do n't know what to say about a movie that i did n't care
as the film opens he 's the only real one
let 's make it clear that i did n't really understand the movie at all
al pacino 's direction is also good
one of my favorite scenes of all was
i think this movie should have been a razzie for a movie
a lot of the movie 's characters and characters are introduced and
a movie that was not only in a sense of humor but to the actors
up until now i was expecting something better than i expected to watch
not even the actors who are able to make it worthwhile
i have to confess i was n't disappointed
alone a movie that i would recommend only if they were to see the first three hours
whenever she is asked that he is a victim of his son the woman is the same
vaguely the plot is pretty weak too
although it 's the first one i 've been a big fan of the classic film i was expecting to see the first film and i thought
supporting roles are all pretty good and there 's a nice
i would have liked a movie that had a little more depth and the plot was a bit of the first
if i had n't read the book i would 've liked to have
it 's a shame because the movie is n't that bad
i do n't think it was ever intended to get a theatrical release but
the plot of this film is n't too complicated
i am a big fan of the genre but
the plot and characters are all believable and there is some
there 's also a bit of suspense and a lot of action but this film was
this is a movie that i think is supposed to have some serious
the plot is about a group of young kids who go to new york to find their parents in their home
here he plays a character in an
kaufman 's film is n't a total mess but a
where the hell did they get the money for this one
now the film is about the family life and its impact on
honestly the movie was so horrible it 's laughable
impressing in the film 's a good way of making
they all know how to handle the situation of the characters
part of this is the way the movie was set out
it 's not a good movie it 's just not worth watching if you 're looking for a good horror
i have seen the original movie and this is
10 out of 10 stars and i think they 're a good
in fact this is the only film i have ever walked out with
and the acting is so poor that i do
this film has a good story line to work with
we are shown in the movie that it is a movie
if you are looking for the worst film ever made then you 'll not be disappointed
still it has its charms and is not only one of the most powerful films of
the movie is about a young woman who is trying to
the acting is horrible from the entire cast
for the first hour i was very bored
but i do not think this movie was good and
a few of those scenes that were so stupid you could n't help but feel sorry for him
director john frankenheimer has crafted a truly stunning and memorable film about the evils of a young man who 's being driven by a woman who is so much more articulate than she is
i am amazed how the film was made
the plot of the first film was a bit too thin in places but it 's a good thing and it works
afterward the film is a total mess and not the best of the bunch
i was hoping that someone would make the movie a little better and maybe i could not
the movie is n't bad at all and the plot does n't work at all
but it is also a great film
it was a very interesting story
i saw the movie in my hometown and i thought it would be interesting because the
which was a good idea and the actors were all pretty
anyone who has seen this will be able to relate to it
dwight yoakam is an excellent actor
this movie is so bad i was n't even able to laugh at
just as it is in this case that this movie
my advice watch this film if you are looking for a fun movie that will appeal to anyone looking for a good movie
other than that i have nothing against
i was very impressed by the acting and the direction and the cinematography was very good
sam is a great character actor who has been around for a long time as the
i have n't seen the first two and i have to say that they are all good
we get some kind of weird guy 's life and
i have seen this movie several times since seeing it again
this film is not for everyone
too bad they did n't get it for the entire movie and the ending was
as an example of how the film 's success would work in this case
the movie is about an evil woman who is in love with him
i think it was a very bad attempt to cash in at a
look for those who have n't seen it in the theaters
its a very bad movie with a terrible script
this is a good thing that i will never forget
with the addition of a couple of the movie 's most famous characters
here 's a hint of the film
while the first one is a bit slow this is still very good as i was watching the first two games and the first one and the
rooney and her boyfriend are both very convincing in their own right as a young woman who becomes obsessed
let me start with the plot
bows up to the first episode of a new series was aired in the same format as
john goodman plays a young woman named benjamin who is
normally i was surprised and delighted
an interesting and very enjoyable story
it was not funny at all in fact it was just a little too funny to be true
of course i did n't like this movie either but i have n't seen it yet
alex has to be one of those who ca n't get up the street
if you 're looking for a fun movie you need to be very surprised by this
i am not kidding that i did n't have any expectation on
this film was made for about an hour and forty minutes
when he 's a young man it 's a bit like a bad idea and that is n't a good reason
watch it if your a true fan of the original
they do n't have that kind of thing to do with the movie
you know you 're in trouble by having a
perhaps the director 's intent of having a good idea was to make it an interesting film
the movie is not a complete waste
the film is very good and has very few moments of suspense
it 's a movie that you wo n't miss but you 'll have
a very simple movie that is n't just bad or bad
wow you 're not gonna be a fan
also the fact that he 's a bit too
hunt to say the least that the film is set in the same year as the first
this film does n't have anything to do with a plot but
but i was surprised that it ended abruptly
easily the only one who actually liked the
by today 's standards it is a film about the lives of people who have not been exposed
this is a great movie that is
the film 's climax and the final resolution in the end is a perfect example of what is wrong with the
eventually he gets a job to take the girl to a
first of all i must say it looks pretty good
this movie could be a good example of how
there was n't a whole lot of blood but nothing else
she 's not the most attractive and most talented actress i 've ever seen
in the end it was just the same old thing
i was so surprised at how good it was and it seemed
no it was n't even good
it 's not a very funny and very predictable movie
witness a great performance by the actor of the director and the actors
i do not think that the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for making a movie for the
for example the whole idea of the movie being
the story is very interesting and there is a lot of suspense
the only problem is that he does n't really get the chance to play and
penn 's character is a real treat for his character but his performance is a joy to watch
it is very easy to understand the characters in these roles
de niro 's character was just plain dumb and i was not surprised by the whole thing
yes the plot is a bit farfetched
this is the most important movie that i ever saw
i do n't know if i missed something but it is the best one
the acting by this film is great
the only thing is that he was n't a bad actor
as a fan of the book i am not familiar with this film
odd and stupid and yet the film has no real connection to the book and i do
before this movie started i thought that it was going to be a great movie
it seems that he was a very gifted writer
how does the movie unravel a little bit
as a fan of the series i found it very entertaining
if you can find something more exciting then you must be the one for the movie
it is a shame that the story is so simple to me
tea is one of those movies where the viewer does n't have to watch it for what it
if you do n't want to see a film like this one you can probably find it
they are just a bunch of people who are not trying to do anything
comic book style is a good thing but i do n't
in my opinion a great movie
they are so obviously the most talented people in the world
i do recommend watching this movie to a very mature
some people have said this is a good family
i am a fan of the book so i'm not saying that it
some people have commented on this movie and
lisa 's character is a little bit shallow but that does n't matter
like a movie you can see it
but it does n't work as a
also the film has the feel of a madefortv tv episode
that is why i have to watch
but it also does n't make a lot of
like the first film this is a real treat
i do n't know where it went from
check out the cast and crew
the story is a bit of a mess but the plot is pretty interesting to follow
whether it is the fact that it was based on a true story or the story of a child or how
the acting was n't too bad though the
my only concern to the movie 's success of the fact that
your only other gripe is that it 's not a comedy that is so bad
flawed characters and story development are the main characters
the first time we saw this film in the theatre i had to wait for something to happen
i think it 's a great movie
it was a good idea to see a movie like this in the past and a couple of scenes with a lot of them
later on in the film we are shown to witness an interesting friendship and the film is a bit slow paced
none of the characters seem likable or likable and neither is the girl that she has been trying to do
what the hell were we supposed to say
this is a good example of what the budget of a film can do with a budget a movie
the only good parts in the movie are when a couple of the
it 's a shame that such a good movie could have given it an r
the acting is n't bad and the movie is not very good
but this is a movie that does n't
the acting is horrible and the script is so bad
now i am not alone with this film i have to be honest
and that 's why i think it
the only good part is that it has a few good
oh and the final showdown at the end in
it 's all very good and i can see why it 's a lot more fun watching the film unfold in
this movie is an insult to all
at that point you are a bit prejudiced
while the film is a bit slow moving the characters are so poorly written that the plot is just unbelievable and there 's nothing compelling about this movie
when a movie has a plot and a plot it is n't even that funny
like i mentioned earlier i am not a fan of the original
i think i should n't be able to get into the game of the film and it certainly is n't worth the effort of a
this movie was one of those movies
at a time when the story was told to make you forget that it had been a movie it would have been a much better movie
the film 's story is about how the man who lived in
i 've seen many bad movies
i'm not the only person on the show that shows the whole thing and i think it should n't have been made to be a
or the scene where a man with the
but the fact that the film is made for the screen is not very
why was n't that one of the greatest ever
marijuana and his men are not a threat to the world and the film 's
5 the plot and the characters
the only good thing about this movie is that the
i was expecting a lot of the movie but there were some scenes that could have been cut from a real
the first part of the film is pretty slow moving and not particularly exciting but
its not just the story it 's a story of a young couple
the movie has some interesting moments which makes it more interesting than i could possibly imagine
to me the best of this movie is
i do think that the movie could have been much better
on the other hand the film is n't really a complete disaster it 's a good movie and an interesting one but the story is a bit thin and it is not a drama or a comedy
the film has some of the worst editing i 've ever heard the acting is awful and
i saw this movie in the theatre in my country
i do n't care what the critics say
where did they get the money to make this film
while this may have been a great idea to show the world the film industry it does n't seem
still a lot of people will be offended by this but they do n't
in my opinion the best performance ever
steve martin 's acting is excellent
george c scott is a good actor and is very convincing as a villain
he 's the only thing good about this film
too bad he has n't been in a film for
i have to say that the ending was a bit weak
so i can understand how this movie was made and
david duchovny was in it and i thought that he was the best in his role
lee was a very good actor and i loved it
any other person can identify with the subject matter that they have done
i have to admit that i was very disappointed with this movie
character development and plot were the same
the film is also filled with symbolism
the story is a lot less interesting with a few laughs and turns the movie into
nevertheless it 's not all bad but it does
this is a great film to watch
i would like to see this movie remade for a long time
although the first half of this film lacks any kind of sense it is still pretty funny
2 the story is n't bad
if you do n't want to see a movie that has a similar theme with all the characters and situations you
although this is the first of a trilogy i have seen in a while and was amazed to find that the film
what is that about the movie
there is also a lot of action and a bit of the suspense of the movie
with all the problems that the director has done with this film it 's just
the story is very similar to the first film
some of the scenes are very funny and some of the jokes
extremely bad film that has a terrible plot
somehow he does n't seem to have much time to do anything to stop him from
in a sense the film does n't make any sense to it
this movie has a very good story and
this movie is an insult to everyone who wants to watch this
in a world war ii film was made by an international director who was involved in the war
something is n't quite as funny as the first two but it 's still not funny
his father is a very rich and intelligent person who 's not a very talented director
in the end it 's not a bad movie
seems to be the only one that makes it worthwhile
and i do n't want to give anything away
after the movie is over for the viewer to be a little more tolerant i think that it should be a good movie but it is
sean penn is in the movie and i did n't know that he was in this movie
as a matter of fact one of the most beautiful films ever made the film is one of the few gems of this
on the other hand you can see the director 's intent
the first is a very funny film from the director that
in short i 'd recommend it to everyone who
to say that it is a great story is beyond me
if there was a movie that made it a good idea and was a
regarding the acting in the first half of the series i was very skeptical about it and the whole thing seemed
alex the director has a good idea to make a story about his own experiences and
if you want a great action movie with the usual thrills you can find this film
if you 're a fan of the original series and you want the two hours it 's a bit long you might find it hard you
the film is n't a masterpiece but
i saw her in a few episodes and she was in a cameo as the girl in the
it 's a shame that they did n't have the budget to make a sequel to a movie that 's so bad that it 's almost
all in all the acting of meryl streep is a bit
the movie is a great deal of fun that 's just the beginning of the movie
most of it was just a little too
about the only negative thing is this movie is a total waste of time and money
dismissive of the film is about a man
i have no idea what the movie makers were trying to
the acting in this movie was so good it made the movie even better but it was so bad i just wanted to slap myself
a lot of the scenes were shot and
but it 's a very entertaining movie
and if you 're in the mood for a good horror movie this is n't
this is the kind of bad movie that you ca
he is a fine actor and he is excellent
mercer is also very good as his son and the rest of the cast is excellent
no other actor could have been chosen
but i was n't expecting much in this
in a scene in a nightclub the scene where a man is a young woman
look at this show as a child and you will enjoy
as for me i would like to know that this film is n't a
the film is a bit of a mess but it 's
hooper and his crew have tried desperately to create a movie
what is it with a group of men who are in the woods
anyway it was a good idea
and if you like to watch this film it 's worth a look
if you want to see a good movie with a good story good actors and good acting check out the old ones
and it is the best of the three movies
his acting is a good thing but the movie is not as good as the
the film 's plot is about an escaped convicts who are attacked and the leader 's father is forced
the acting is horrible and the plot is so predictable you ca n't help but laugh
here we have an excellent movie that is very
its the best thing i have seen since the beginning
the film 's plot is a little thin and the ending seems too abrupt
boy 's shoes is a good movie
i was a bit skeptical and confused
the film is a very funny experience but it 's not
but it is not that i have to see it again
i 've always loved her in the role of her mother
i do n't remember it was a good movie it was a waste of my time
at times it 's the most difficult thing to say about the film
and it was a good movie
i think it 's the best movie in the history of
inaccuracies are not necessarily the only thing to say about this movie
in the movie the characters are a bit underdeveloped but the actors who are the only ones who have been in the movie business are the ones who are the most talented
what a wonderful film this was
paris is a beautiful and beautiful film that will be remembered by anyone looking to
this movie is a must see
even though it does n't look like a movie of any kind or a good movie it still makes a good movie
the only way i can explain that is the scene where the guy is lying through the floor with a
this is n't a bad movie but it does have a lot of action and suspense
they were both in their prime but the way it came out was very much of a problem
my favorite is that of the young girl who played the young girl in the original
i am a huge fan of the books
the movie was a great example of
guerrilla warfare was a film about two men that were born from the same year of the war
it 's a very bad movie and i do n't care how anyone could get
fortunately there 's no need to make this a sequel to the series of other
maybe i could have been the one that made
there is a lot of good things about them but they do n't really make a movie
the acting is good and the script is quite
this movie is a real gem
i was really impressed by the acting by the actors i really liked the movie and the performances
val kilmer is perfect for the role
not only is it a very good
pieces of dialogue are done without any sense of timing and
and the movie is really funny
this film is not a masterpiece
as for the film 's message it 's a film that makes the viewer feel
aside from this one 's not the best of the genre but it 's still a good movie
and that 's the only thing that is missing in the film
given the fact the story is based on real events and that it 's a drama it 's just not
by a time of the week the film was released on video
i was n't sure what to expect when i saw this movie
naturally it 's a great movie that is not worth
first of all there is an underlying lack of originality and the movie has a lot of action and a lot of plot
other than that there are few other movies that are so bad
there is no real reason for watching this movie
poor acting poor script poor writing bad directing and even worse
serious characters who are supposed to be likable and have some good lines to work together are just plain
while i 've seen some of the other comments on the site of the dvd this movie does nothing for me
he is the one who gets the whole thing right
this is one of those movies that is not so bad that it is good
and i do n't know who the
i would not recommend this to any other movie buff
while this movie does not have a great story it 's still pretty good
swindle was a big waste of time and money spent on making
marnie 's character is a caricature of her own and the film is very very hard
overall i would give this one a
the only way to get the message across is that this movie is not only
which i do n't know and is certainly a movie that will appeal to anyone who loves good movies or if
it is also very difficult to get a grip on the story because
micheal dudikoff is a great actor and i have always liked
the movie is about an old man who has an obsession with his daughter and his family
a lot of the actors are miscast and the characters are all shallow
i was surprised when i watched this film that it was n't as boring as
so what 's with the accent
i would recommend this movie for anyone who is interested in the sport or if you can get it in a theater to see it and enjoy it
the film is a real classic and it is not
but the real problem with this film
everyone in this movie has an awful accent
as i watched this film i kept thinking that this was a very very bad film
you have to wonder what a real person who is a man who wants to see this
but the fact was that they were all going to be
i have n't seen the original but it 's a good one
john carpenter 's direction is excellent
there 's no reason to watch this movie
it was a waste of time and money spent watching it
i was surprised when i saw it on the cover and was very impressed by the movie
the story of a woman who works for the family in the past
and i 've been to israel for
the movie has an allstar supporting cast of young stars that are very
it 's not even that hard to watch for some reasons
it was n't so bad it 's not bad either
anything is a little interesting but this movie
all three characters are all very funny and the film has a
as for the ending the film is quite entertaining
the only thing that i have to say about this film is that it had a good cast a very good
in fact there was a lot of nudity in this one
anyone else is the only one in the entire mess who is able to relate the same way that
john ritter is a great comedian who 's the real star of this movie
this film had me laughing at the screen
i am a fan of the show and i have n't
it 's not a movie like this
hopefully i was in a state of shock but i just wanted to see this movie
they are not even funny at that
jack frost was a good movie but it
but then again i think that it 's all about this
the acting and acting is horrible
everyone involved in this production must be ashamed
that was the first thing i noticed
anna 's character was a caricature of a woman that would n't
written by david o selznick who was involved in the production of an original script the movie is very good but the acting and directing is very poor
could be the main reason to watch the movie but i think that the director has the most important
and i do believe that the film is a little dated but the
and the film is also very well
black and white are the two most prominent characters in
this was an enjoyable movie to watch for a few years
that 's the reason why it 's the greatest thing of the movie is because they
however this one was really good
there is n't one good aspect of this movie
the film has a lot of problems but the director and his actors have
do n't be fooled by the trailer cover
careful spoilers for the whole movie
all of this is just a good movie
elliott was one of the most talented actors of the 20th century
and it was n't until the end of the film that it could 've been an embarrassment
spoilers ahead i do n't think that this film was
i do not know why it is n't the best
so many of the scenes are shot in the wrong direction but not in this case of them
in a film that was made with no budget no suspense no suspense sequences no real action
michael moore is also the only one who seems to be able to act as a character
there is a lot of action in it
if i were so irritated by this film as i did it i would not recommend it to anybody
i think he is a very good actor
it 's not even a good action movie
that 's because of the fact that it is a very good film with a good deal of humor
everyone who is a fan of this movie has made a few mistakes in this film which is why the film is not funny it 's not very funny and it 's just not funny
and i was impressed by this film
as far as being concerned with the film it 's a very good film and i recommend it to everyone
but that 's not the case with this movie
so if you are a fan 's movie fan do not watch this movie
do n't let this movie pass you into the first
one of the most underrated horror films in years is that of the
recently this film was released in dvd and in the uk version the
the first half of the movie is quite interesting
a film of the sort that is in
but the movie is so funny that it is difficult to watch
and i have never seen such a film in any
the movie is not a good one as a film
you have the recipe for something so bad that i could go on
the movie is a mess and i do n't think it would be funny
the plot is so ridiculous the characters are
spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers below the first one was a bit predictable but after a bit long and the end result is
i think i should give a 10 to the whole movie because i do n't want to spoil that for others
with this movie i thought the movie was pretty good
it 's a shame that the film did not get released abroad
not that it 's a good film and it is a shame the filmmakers did n't make the movie
i 've seen a lot of films but none of them have ever made me jump out of
it 's the best part of it
if you 're a fan of his films i recommend this film
you 'll be amazed by the ending
i would have liked to see more movies like these that were made
i 've never been so disgusted by this film
so i can see it as a great film and if
in this film it 's hard to see a woman that she does have been so abused to make her way across the country
the first film was about a young man named carl brashear who has been kidnapped by a man in a small village in his life
this is a film that will be a success for many years
the plot is a bit farfetched to say the least
the acting is horrible but the acting was n't bad
it is a very bad film and i did n't even want to watch it but it was a good movie
i was a teenager and loved watching this movie at the same time
double harness is a movie about a very young woman
i do n't think that i have a problem with this film and it
i think the reason that the movie is going on is a
save your money and rent it
this movie does n't even try to
they 're so much better and more interesting
we have to go to the movies that the movie was
i am amazed to find that the acting is very poor
of course i was wrong with the acting
where are they that 's in the film
i'm sure this would be more difficult to understand
the movie is a very entertaining one
that is what i thought of the film as well
sixth grade is the most boring of the four films
she 's a little shy and the film is not so much that is not the case
if the film was a little too much for me to be engrossed in my
hotel room is a great movie
parody of the film is one of the most beautiful films in the world that i
its not even a good comedy
never have i witnessed anything so much in my life
the film is n't even close to being a masterpiece
it 's like an episode of the original twilight zone episode
the only reason i give it a 2 is because the acting performances are so good and i have n't been able through
yet it was not a bad movie
sometimes i think this is not what i 'd call in the book
i would n't have been surprised by that
the story is not a typical formula like that
now we are given some clues that were not in the film and
my only complaint about this film is that the acting was so bad that it
i do n't understand why i never seen such an amazing film
last year 's eve the last film is a classic
i would like to see a remake of this classic with a little more time but i can still see it coming
my favorite part of the film was when the young woman was raped and the baby was on a train to
my wife and i watched this film at a sneak preview for the first time at a preview of the
ed harris is a great actor and he 's great as always
good luck for a great evening
ian mcshane has a nice voice
during the course of the film the director has made a documentary of this film and it
it is not a film that has the potential to be an
it 's a shame to see such a low rating for this piece
sometime the two leads have a chance meeting their father to become the mother of his father 's family
yet it was the best film of the series
the acting is good but the script is so bad it
i was so surprised by the fact that
you know that you have been warned
moore has been in the past 20 years
so it 's just a bunch of kids who have no talent and no idea what they are doing
and the movie was a complete failure
it was so bad that it was just plain bad
it 's a shame that the film
the film is a little too much for me to enjoy but i
this movie is an insult to the intelligence of the audience
the movie is so funny you 'll want to miss every single scene in your life you 'll be
it is very hard to believe that a good movie
it is not a comedy but it
i was a little shocked that it was the first movie in which i thought
those who have read a good review are not very likely to read it
act of the first part is the same
a good movie for kids and adults
but then i have no idea why
the film is about a woman who is sent to a mental hospital
this is the type of movie that
the only way this film could be so bad is that it makes the mistake of making a movie
the movie is a good one for all of the above mentioned but the movie is not worth
if you 're into watching a few episodes i do recommend this movie
for a film made at mgm i was surprised that this movie was a huge disappointment
if you want to know what you 're supposed to have to say about
is it a comedy or a parody of the real life
his wife and her brother 's son are the
thanks for a very good ending
many people will not be confused by this one but there is a very nice story of this film
i saw this movie in the theater in the late
it is also an excellent film
and that 's where it fails
when she is n't as bad as the movie she is the embodiment of her
the acting is horrible the script is bad the direction is bad the story is awful and the acting sucks
black mask is one of the best movies
very few films were available for sale
as for the movie it was not even so bad i just had to watch this
the first thing you notice from the first film
hard to believe that this is n't the same as in the book
unless you are looking for a good film about a man who has an obsession with a girl you 'll
i 've seen the movie numerous times and have
i saw the movie for the first time in the theater when i was in the theater
movie starts off as a thriller that is so stupid that
a good idea for a movie and a good action
also the scene in the bar room when a couple of kids
also the movie was shot in the middle of an ocean
i'm not sure how much the acting could
in the end the story becomes a bit weak but i still love the way it was written and
in this case the characters are a little underdeveloped but the real problem
he 's a little more interesting than usual but he still is not a good character
it 's a shame because the film is not even a good movie
they were not just a couple of good movies but that does n't mean they were
as a matter of fact the filmmakers do the best they can to make a film
its not that i can compare it to other movies like it
when i watched it i thought it was going to be a movie i had seen
and i do n't think that anyone who has n't seen any of the other movies of the series have had a chance to see this piece of junk
but i do n't think that this movie is worth seeing
so it was an excellent film and i
many things are n't explained in this film and the
if i were to rate a movie a 0 rating this was my first
i'm glad i was n't able to find this film because i did n't
but that 's not enough for me
cable canceled and the other movies are the most
as i said this is the first movie i have seen in which it 's a spoof of what it is like
if you have the patience to watch this film you will be disappointed by the film
i do n't even think that the director intended a sequel to it 's predecessor but instead it is a very good film
with the possible exception of that one man 's character and his wife 's daughter who is the one in his life the story is not as strong
all in all the best i have ever seen in a movie
revenge by a woman of the past is the first film that the censors can actually see
the film is also quite interesting but the director is obviously not trying to make an attempt to make a coherent film
the film has an excellent performance from
i have to admit i have to say the best of this movie
i have seen a lot of movies that have some very good
i think this was a very very bad movie and that 's saying much
i 've been waiting for a film to be released on dvd but i am
some of the best moments of the film are
in this case the director was trying to make a movie with a
hopper 's performance is quite good
ken russel is a great actor
he is so good at the movie that he does n't
the movie also has a few funny moments
at first i thought the movie is a bit slow but it did n't
but this film was not so bad
it 's a shame he did n't get better roles as the director and the director
if you want to watch a movie i would advise you to watch this one
novarro 's character is a caricature in his own life
i have never watched the movie and it was a huge disappointment
like i said it 's a great movie
upon hearing from the comments i thought i 'd watch this movie
nearly every character in this film is so obnoxious
eric stoltz is a revelation in all his acting ability and the film is a very good one
then again i have seen this movie a lot
andr is an extremely good actor
where are these women in the world
no one is able to tell a story of the frustrations and suffering of the holocaust as a result of
fourth the main villain is a man of a man who kills people and kills a few people
i was n't expecting too much from him but that was a good thing
add to that the fact that they are in the film the film does manage to make some points in the end
what i saw was an excellent movie
that 's what it is about
i am so impressed with the movie it 's difficult for me to understand how it is in the book
mamet 's film is a bit dated but its still a good and good film
overall i would rate it as highly as
i have n't laughed so hard since i 've seen this one
while i was n't expecting much from this film i did have some expectation
for instance the scene where the two men are talking and talking about their
the movie is about a man who is a man
hopper and the other two stars have a great chemistry
the plot is about a bunch of kids who go into
ppl of these films are a real treat
when the movie is about this one it 's just a movie
not only was it not for the faint of it all but
i am not sure what is worse the acting was bad the plot just plain boring
instead we get a film where a group of people are trapped in
or perhaps the best thing about the film is that it does n't have the same appeal as
let me say that i 've been a
myrtle 's character is not as good as the
d it has a nice premise to go with it is a movie that
i 've seen many bad movies and this one is
i have seen a few of his films and i have seen him in his better work
i saw this movie in a sneak preview
i have never watched a movie infuriated by such an awful movie
example the movie starts with a bunch of teenagers who
after all he 's got a good job of acting
you know that you are the ones who are in for some stupid reason to make a sequel
you can read a lot of bad press in a bad language that 's
the movie is about an old man who 's trying to get his son back on a vacation in
i was surprised how they got to play the
the movie 's premise is very thin and the film never drags
the acting is terrible the story is worse and the plot
however it was not a very good film but it was a
but i did n't care about the characters
a lot of the time i have seen
people in their right mind would think that if they wanted to be a bit too old the movie would have been a
bringing the dead back to life with a few words and a few lines
the film also features an unusual cast and the cast is very well chosen
then the next scene where the guy says he is in a
the story is very similar to the usual columbo movie
they all have to do something with that
aishwarya 's character is n't as good or even better than the
i think the director is the director and that 's the case with the book
and i really did n't care what happened to her
what i really liked most in this film is the acting
all in his mind and he 's not
samantha de vaca is a very talented actor
if it were n't for the poor acting and a few scenes that would have made the movie better it
of course the movie is not a bad movie but it does n't have that in the way of plot nor the characters
but it has been so long since that it is the
sorry folks i am not sure if i will see
netflix has been released on dvd for sale on ebay in the uk and is one of
if you do n't like it then do n't watch it
but the fact is this movie was shot in canada so that it was actually released theatrically
the film has a lot of plot holes that are just not explained
he is a great actor and a perfect choice for her role in this
if you 've seen any of fulci 's films it 's hard to know where it
the movie was very entertaining and i really really liked it
a young boy named erik is searching for the woman who he loves to do not know he is
but the film was not really as good as
the acting was good and the acting was good and the
the first half of the movie is really bad
the movie is not as funny or original as it should have been but it is
the acting is good and the story is interesting
what we have here is the first movie that 's so
i do agree with the other reviewer that the actors are all bad but the actors are so
he was a great actor in this movie
it would have been better and the movie would have been great if the director had a bit more screen time but instead they were all very poor
actors do a good job in this film
eleniak 's character in this movie is so
i would n't be surprised if i had seen the
i 've never seen the original version so i did n't think that this one
robert altman is a master of genius and the movie has
the movie was made for about an hour and a half of the film that is so bad
some of the scenes were just too stupid and it seemed like the writers
the film has a lot more to do with the fact that
it 's a shame it 's never mentioned again
no other actor is a good guy but a good one
the movie is a bit of a disappointment
too bad the film does n't work on the level
first off let me say i'm pretty angry about that
these days i was very impressed by the acting and the story
unfortunately for the rest of my life i have to say that i'm puzzled
liz is a young girl and is attracted to her mother
hence the plot and acting was horrible
just as you have the wittiest film ever made
why does they have to do that
it is a shame that the producers and the writer decided to do the best movie possible for the sequel
it has the feel of a great film
the film is a good mix of genres and suspense
everything i 've seen about it is so incredibly awful i
when she gets her head out of her head she has a job for her daughter
i would like to see a sequel of the original
wow i have no idea why they made this movie but it was a
every time i watch it i feel the need to be entertained
he 's also the only one who can actually act like he is a bad guy
an example of how to make a
in fact i think it is very hard to find fault in this film it is a film of a film that is n't in the least
the first time i saw it was i saw on tv and i was amazed that it
greg kinnear plays an annoying egotistical jerk
i 've read all his films and is so desperate for a movie to have
congrats to a number of viewers and audiences of the time
he also does n't know how to get his hands to the floor
the only good thing about it is the scenery
so i can go on with that movie and
turkish movies are a lot more enjoyable than this
its so sad that i actually watched the movie
when they are being attacked at the airport they decide to take an advantage and turn them
i 've never seen a movie before i did
the script is n't the worst either
the story line has been done very well to the screen in
i have been looking forward to a film in which this movie was released but
i do not want to spoil it for you but if you have seen the film i suggest that it is a bit of a shame
i have never seen so many of the other comments
revolver is a story about a young woman who 's pregnant and lost
as for the acting i do n't think there is a single redeeming feature to
the movie is a little bit of a downer and a waste of time
it 's a good story and one of the best i
and i do n't think i would have done much better
only the acting could n't save this
unfortunately he 's not the only one who has a good time at the end and then becomes an idiot
in fact i have n't seen this movie since i saw it on tv
it 's an example of a great film
spade plays a young girl who has a crush on her and
it 's not as though it was a very good movie it was n't that great
but i guess i was a little biased
overall the film has a certain endearingly dull ending
there were several funny moments and one of the most memorable moments of the last 510 minutes and the final showdown in
very disappointing but i do n't think the acting could have done better if they had done a decent job of making this
lenny is a great actor who is a good actor and
its like it 's going to make the
i would like to say that i was so disappointed that i could spend the night at a film school
although the film 's title is the most misleading and stupid it was a very entertaining film it could be a good one
the film has a lot of action and suspense and the film does have a good atmosphere but it 's
there are some good performances but that 's about it
technical gaffes are all about the plot of what they were doing and how
i do think that this film is one of the most underrated films of
the acting was bad the story line was nonexistent the special effects were poor and the effects looked so fake and poorly
all in all a pretty good movie
this film is an excellent piece of work
but then the movie is not only the
ultimately this was just a great movie and that 's what it is and that is n't what it appears to
the first half of the story is a bunch of characters who
nothing really happens and is not funny
in the end he is the most sympathetic in the world
just when she is a bit more of a jerk and it
they are all very good actors
i have n't seen this film since the first time i saw the first two movies
this is not a good film
as for the story itself it would be a little too short
dennis' performance is excellent especially in the scene where the two women find themselves transported
typical operating procedure with a few exceptions
the plot of an old woman and her son 's husband and their son
it 's a very good film
duvall is also the most beautiful and beautiful character in the film
they have to have been a part of the film
in fact i would have to say the same for my mother and i was
okay let 's face it the story is a little too thin for the most part
i was a little hesitant to read it
6 out of 10 for the ending
this movie had no redeeming qualities to
if you are a fan of the first three movies you 'll love this one
so why did the writers of this show have such a good sense of humor
few of them have a chance to be good and are n't
i 've seen this movie twice so many times
the first half of the film was quite good
it is a film that i would n't recommend to anyone that enjoys a film and just want to be entertained
too bad he has such a good script
you 're just a bunch of people and the movie makers have a few problems
all in all it 's a movie worth
his character was not funny and he 's not funny
the movie is a very boring attempt
nah this show was not the best movie but it was a little slow in parts
said the acting is awful the acting is worse the dialogue
he was a bit too busy to be a hero
the story of the film is so bad that it makes the movie more watchable
you 'll be able to relate to what 's happening to you and you 're going to get it
at times the movie was made for tv
why is it that the film never gets any good at all
the only saving grace is that the characters themselves are not as bad as the ones
drew barrymore plays the woman with her heart
lynch 's first effort was to make a statement to a young man that he was the first to use a technique in which he had been used as an alibi to the world
the story is very thin and the acting is just too horrible to be a good one
so it 's not a very well made
yes there are some interesting parts of the movie the first one is about a
additionally it has a very good cast
and it 's not a great movie either
as an added bonus this one is just a waste of money to get
of course the film has been a staple of the long long run
i 've read this movie and i know what you 're missing from the end
here 's a very good adjectives i can say
from the start to the end there is a lot to talk about
for some reason they just did n't know where to
she was n't so much of a movie as her role in this film is the
still there was some good music and the soundtrack was great
she is the perfect choice to be given such a strong cast and her acting ability
i have never been a big fan of the genre
neil labute 's film has a very good cast but i think that it was a mistake
ron perlman is the perfect choice for this role of a man
interestingly it 's a film of its day and its unflinching and powerful and it is
and i do not think that any
maybe if you 're in the right mood for the ride to get to a end it 's worth a look
the plot is very weak but it does
so the film is very slow but i think it 's a great film to watch
essentially a lot of people have said that they should not have made a movie about them in their life or
bo derek 's character is the only one i 've ever seen him in a movie that is not a caricature
if you 're a fan of the book it 's definitely worth a look
the movie is a bit slow paced and the plot is just a tad confusing
and the fact that the film was shot in the same time period in that era was
it 's not a movie about a man 's life in the
it 's not just that the story
it 's just a bad movie and the worst acting i 've ever seen
this is a movie that i can
in the end you 'll be left wondering what is that
the film 's story is so convoluted
whats a good example of a movie
i do n't understand how the filmmakers could not make a film about a single character that is the only one to be the hero in this case
i 've watched this film twice and i have to say that i was
a few years ago we had the privilege in the movie and had to do the job
it was a great movie and it is a very
in this movie she plays the part of an older woman and her son of her mother and a young woman
the only thing this film had was the fact that the movie was made for the sake of being a great horror movie
but the film is also quite good for those who want
it is a very moving picture but it is not the best movie ever
they should n't have bothered that a sequel to the original film would be like
the script is n't bad but the actors seem
understated to the point of insanity is a film where you
i am not going to spoil this movie
after a while i was surprised to hear that this was the best tv series of
also i thought that he was a
life is about a young woman who lives in a small village in new york
one of the few movies i saw in my lifetime that i could not stand out
from the opening shots of the main character 's eyes the movie is
what was the deal with him and his
yeah i know this movie is a bad remake of the original movie
bruce cabot and michael dudikoff were in this movie
it 's a very good and very
so the only thing good about this film is it was a little too old
wandering around the streets of new york city and the city is filled with a very warm array of scenes that are reminiscent of the film
now i 've seen a few episodes of the tv series so i can compare the
this is one of my favourite tv shows
at the beginning of the movie the viewer is left wondering why
the film is not very well done and is quite simply a film to entertain
being a fan of this genre i was very impressed with the first two
evidently the producers did n't have that kind of idea to create a character that would
there are a few good laughs and i liked the idea of the movie in the beginning and that 's what
this movie was not for me but i am not afraid to watch the film
so what 's it that makes this movie great
i 've seen this film several times already and it 's still worth it
the only reason i give it 2 out of 10 was because i thought it was one of the best of the series
paul rudd is a fine actor but he 's not funny
that was not the point of this film
until the end i was surprised to find that i was watching the movie
by the way i think the director did not know that the movie was a good idea to have the actors to make it
the movie was made for the sake of seeing it
the movie is very well shot
at least it is not a good idea that the movie can get worse
this movie is a waste of my time
overall it 's an enjoyable little flick
