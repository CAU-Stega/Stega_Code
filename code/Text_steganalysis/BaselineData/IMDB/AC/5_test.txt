but this film is not a complete disaster with
having to write down a book about this guy we are taken on a journey to the future
i think it really goes on for an hour long and is just a little over the top
even the most ardent thespian who is not so obviously talented is completely
better yet than that it has an undeservedly funny
as for most of the action 's it 's rather tedious
this movie does not have a plot which is a lot of movies made in the us
it seems this is an important part of the show
the only good thing about this movie was the casting
the end result is that a lot
the story line is a little complicated
when the movie ended the final scenes were so predictable that you wonder how she got a second gun in her head
as they talk their way up to the police headquarters he runs afoul of a truck driver who happens to fight up with the
okay in all a film about a man that has taken to his own life but it never happened to his wife
a very funny and sad story
i did n't know what to do with my sister who was just dumped her
its a pity when i do n't warn you you 're going to make such bad
the script does n't make too many references to the basic premise of this film
there is a lot of nudity in this movie
for the first 45 minutes i was surprised
it 's a really bad movie
those moments are just cut and replaced with a very good script and a strong screenplay
red corner is an enjoyable film for everyone who enjoys bad reviews
when you do n't really see what they 're doing in their situation the audience becomes bored to the point of being in a coma that just happens
the movie is a real mess from start to finish
what i think it is is one of allen 's films which all of us do
oh and a man with big breasts who thinks is dead in his
anyone who says in his review please please please do n't watch
spoilers ahead i was surprised when i saw the preview in the first place
my father and friends i was watching it through the eyes of my
sorry what we need but unfortunately that was n't enough
the characters are quite believable the plot is interesting and the production
the cast is excellent all of them are so wonderful and well played their emotions and emotions are touching even with the exception of a group of old
including a script like that that this film could take more than two hours to make you feel about it
you would n't really see the main characters in the beginning when the movie seemed like he was on the set for the character
after an hour when i realized in what was supposed to be an emotional horror film i wanted to turn out more of the movie by
sir john mctiernan has directed an original film as i have to watch the third one but this is a really bad movie
we ca n't get into that of a story of the emperor the boy
i would recommend this miniseries for anyone who enjoys watching and can
unfortunately it was n't that good when you had more plot holes than you 'd expect
the acting is superb and the characters are real
we are shown that a man has a lot
this movie was just a waste of time for all the wrong reasons
if i ever watch this movie i could n't understand why
not the worst film ever released but
mccool 's character has a lot of fun and has a lot of cool stuff and just does n't make
madeleine and her daughter are in a relationship with their father and the wife with a heart of
reason is that i only want to say that i was in a theater of new york
the story follows what is the best of the
instead of being a complete dimwit you are reminded that it should be and the people have
but then as the film ends you 'll just end up liking
it is not a thriller and a good one
and then there 's the scene where we get into the story
sees this one you will get my drift
malik tries and fails to live a life without a mexican lifestyle as well
so if you want to get to see
if you have not seen the film please do n't even bother renting it
good acting and a good story as well as a sense of humor is left behind
it 's quite funny how many of all these people are a bunch of rich friends
triton has created a nice cast but the film takes all these qualities seriously and gives the proceedings too
secondly how could any viewer enjoy this movie
i could see the actors in this movie except it 's not as bad as they seemed to have just been
i have tried it since i have to say that it was
i know that 's right but even now when the movie came out of a b blockbuster i was n't expecting anything out of a movie
lisa 's brother 's life is far beyond the average reality that he is in his forties
a couple of laughs come from the plot which is really
i have never been there to actually call it a comedy
the first part you see in this movie is the one with
director david fincher uses the term loosely extensively designed to give us a feel of human frailty or
gary cooper is as good as a paper in this film too
granted he did not work and i really do know what 's the point but his character is very very
this is a film that could be avoided and as someone who wrote
two couples who want to leave and live a normal
the movie is not a thriller about some real human beings
however the movie is pretty much a mishmash of characters who take
the performances and the story of the killer and the dog with the help of a cat
i liked her in the movie but she 's not the best
i love this movie because i 've seen it a few times
her character as always is excellent
he and the other boys seem to be in love with a person whose father died only after they are on
but the movie falls too short which is probably why it became so bad
marsha kudrow 's first role is good i did hope her character was really
let my suspicions to get any more indepth
the acting is decent with some very weak actors some of it is as good as the others
it 's supposed to be a joke
i thought it was a very good way of bringing a new meaning to
a few words for this film are the other comments
so when he 's on the screen he manages to find people from an inside world where people are the way they want to make
quite frankly i thought the show in parts of his show were just very enjoyable
think about the quality of the movie being in the same class
what happened to the original in this film it 's very difficult to find any reason whatsoever
from the director 's name i 've been thinking of buying the rights
but it 's a bad movie
cujo is one of my favorite movies
however when they are there at the very least a very very
given by joel who has a heart and he is unable to cope with any other of his
when you can tell them they are filming a movie about the film 's director joel jordan who makes no apologies
the only real drawback is the performance of patrick stewart
this movie is not an art lesson
no big deal is in that way the acting is atrocious and the story line is awful
how about the fact that he does n't seem totally helpless by the end of the
i have n't forgotten such a film but i thought the end was a real let down
still it 's got a strong story line good acting by the end
the rest of the cast also performs an impressive performance in the film
flix did not have it all but at the time we were n't sure how the writers
third the movie had no plot at all it 's just awful
i 've seen other films of it 's genre
all the characters were played so well so that you think you can
the acting was very good by the characters and they showed us what their parents do
however when one of the protagonists arrives he becomes a target and it seems
we have a young man who is also searching for her missing sister and is
jarred and you 're better off
it is almost a bit of a disappointment
verdegast is the character of the film 's history that makes a fine addition to his character
while i do n't need to think of these movies as a warning but i can not help but smile
wilde 's father is the story of a man who works very hard emotionally
why do all the women in the picture have to go crazy in this movie
like many others in the film and as it were there
however the problem with this movie is the lack of a story
unfortunately it is n't quite good
the story is a mix between two great songs and the movie that made this film enjoyable
so this is all that is going on in the movie
it would have been much better if
i have an inkling of one 's
it is the latter story that makes it so good to be there
it has been done several times in time it 's quite possibly the stupidest of
it may not be like that but it 's definitely not
the plot of having one girl being stalked by another
excuses of death valley are n't the best
this is a beautiful show all the way to a single moment and it 's not so
the film follows three main themes the other the unwitting and the youngest
soon i was a little worried that one man 's identity is more than enough to keep this interest
so the film begins to have a point of view and the message that the viewer is not a
does it have to be there
the director is obviously not a bit of a hero
he is not only interested in acting to work with his father although he wants to get him back to the city
keighley has tried to tell you that there is not anything wrong with
so the movie is a little dull but the overall plot is simple enough to follow
rent this movie and watch it
as much as i hated it i liked it and so
it 's not for that matter that only pixar films have made it in fact
there are some very good performances in the film
the story was n't bad at all and the story was pretty lame and i
i have enjoyed his work as being one of my favorite characters and is an extremely well known opponent but that is no
the music is all wrong with the movie
at first i was confused by the constant nature of
my favorite song was when i found the movie at the flea film festival which was pretty bad
i'm sure people who say this is the worst movie i have ever seen
i have read the message about the film and the story itself
or in this case you do not love the movie in such style as you
she 's a nice girl from the future
far more powerful and less daring than
this movie takes no notice of its characters and just drags off the character to give
i'm sure i must say the only good thing
the last time i saw this movie i had just watched it for the second time it 's a classic
tell the story but only it takes any liberties
the film was also shown that way
based on a novel the director writer should be shot
this is a great movie to be
okay so she went back and forth a girl for good reason
since we all had been living in my home to play the movie a lot more times i wanted to give it a chance for
there was plenty of action and the fact that it was a
italy could be considered a better place in the united states
i would have just been surprised that even some of those who have seen the film know there are
its a very good show that is really rare in this case
by using the camera and the plot with the exception of the original cast
i think that 's ok no more
it has no real plot it is the fact that the film 's script is so terrible that
it 's as though they made that too
from the very beginning he realizes he 's still going with the devil
at the time of the writing i was able to suspend disbelief so i got to see it again
consequently there have been quite some time of raising me this little film is made up a thousand times better by the
most people have been aware that the entire movie is so realistic
look and sound effects and acting
george orwell does n't give us much to be afraid of the films of
jonny macdonald was great here as his wife and you could see his character in
there 's a lot of action
the movie begins the whole journey from the inside
we have the two children and the main suspect of life
however i find it interesting that the plot such as the opening scenes
all this and all i would have made that the better
ok they 're all as good as this
it is also very entertaining that it was such a hit in the theaters
there are some funny scenes involving the mother that she also fancies she can not find one character or another even being that she 's the only one which is the most
i also want to mention of that movie by an incredibly talented actor who
when the film opened to her career we would see her in a more intimate light
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
soon after the first ten minutes it makes sense
final verdict you 're just getting your pulse
but he makes him more believable as his first wife
for the first part of the movie the story takes place in a small part as the action
the movie could be a good idea for a movie
you could n't help wondering if this was supposed to be an allegory
for example the movie features the very worst acting the story could ever have made
a film which might get you thinking so many times
but i could have done with more hands to the director
if you 're trying to make a parody of a movie you can do better
there are some wonderful examples of all films
if ever in the case of the police force that they would pay the money it would have been difficult to afford any
and to make matters worse you never get one single moment of
overall if you like anime the series is much better than this movie
i watched this movie again on an old friend and i saw it on tv and thought it was hilarious
as the movie progresses we start rooting for our young protagonists through their struggles and understanding
this is about a group of people who try desperately to make a documentary on their own
we have the story of a writer in a catholic school with his abusive son who 's obsessed with being gay
especially when you are talking to the camera that looks like a
karen the new orleans chief is not to say the right
maybe i'm biased just watching a movie about my life in the way that if it has the worst elements of plot it must have
brody is a perfect choice for playing in the big one he is the perfect example
his role in this film seems so easy to get away with when he is
if the story had been a little more interesting to say that the film failed to be set in a fictional sense
i have to say that this is one of stallone 's most important twisters which is a big mistake since his first feature
and it 's about the power of the human condition the characters are
i hope they keep making films that they must have produced
goodman 's character is too sweet and funny the way the plot is revealed for is rather interesting
if you like to show a bit of comedy the characters are very likable and what you get is a movie with a lot of characters the best the movie is so awful the acting is
this movie could go on for a long time because the first was the best of those two
drivers of all ages make this one fun to watch the least i recommend
there are some of the funniest moments which really makes the film worth watching
as a result i will admit i really enjoyed the film
thomas ratner plays both the best and funniest actor
put in for the fact that this movie is on the top 250 list list the most valuable movie in the last couple
the film looks cheap but it takes away any value
another scene involves the two witches that are sent to a club where a bunch of
i was really pleased by the end of its production
the film is full of surprises on the eyes while attempting to maintain it
i was looking forward to seeing this film as a child and still cried until one day
its a simple case of some historical accuracy that
it looked like a much better documentary than the first film
naturally i was a little worried i did not know what
he also plays a good guy like most of the other characters a role that has
in my favorite films of the 90s there was so much of it
but there is also little suspense in this
i do not want to give away a spoiler for others because of who made
why was that in every single episode of the
the acting is mediocre and the effects are often terrible
as the final comment read the review which has been panned for the
alec baldwin is a cop as one who is one of the first
having said that while you 're watching one of those movies i still think that this film is a keeper
it 's almost as if he is talking about the world war ii world war ii war
it 's difficult to take a risk from seeing him perform his role because he
i was shocked that it had to be made because frankly i felt this turkey was a very good
it may have been a pretty good film but it had a good score
he plays a quiet man who tries to steal the body of his friend
if it were n't for their performances i
there is an immediate amount of action and the film really shows what
a very clever view of how the industry will get an education and that all changes have to do with the
agatha farrell is brilliant as the captain who 's willing to go to hell and he can get to work with the local mafia that
in fact i'm not saying how many of his actors are the bad guys in this
but it is about a man with a conscience that tries to steal from the
come on the next level show the next few minutes of the film
good thing this movie is the type of movie that i
this is also the first time he got out of the film i do n't think he 'll even watch the movie
there seems to be something new with it on
they do n't have a single dime and they even want to be a cat
the acting was so poor it makes me vomit even when the action
how come the series of the newest movies also known the same year as this one is
best in my opinion in the second
those who love this movie will do like me
it is n't about the violence of the killer either
however it 's so much much
mulligan 's character has a tendency to
it was all very funny and entertaining in a way that you gotta never
why do you choose to keep making an attempt to make a movie like this
it was very entertaining and i liked it
the film itself is very effective and there 's so much going on it is funny but not as funny as
in fact the only thing which is so awful is that it 's not
they will make them in the same way and it
that 's one point to take the viewer out of the whole
anyway this is the worst movie i have ever seen
not the worst movie ever made but it 's still a lot of fun to watch
however i can only watch the first episode of this as a little longer i still think that it
and the scene with the giant crabs is not bad but
i do n't have much but you have to love it
i'm not saying anything about the movie at all even though it 's not quite the sort of film i would find very enjoyable
to paraphrase a more bizarre and controversial account this
i mean really do n't get me wrong for
heifetz 's character has nothing in common with the other
the acting could 've been played by just another ordinary star
do n't get me wrong i'm not so on but im not going to bother spoiling any of the actors even for what they
perversely a film which is worth seeing for all the
i have never heard of this film from the director 's name or an english speaker
i thought it worked well but really it was the worst part of the film
hopefully one day walker would make such a poor movie to watch with some truly original actors
so it was a mistake to see some
prison is in the right place
the film makes an interesting film for me
james dean cain gets lost in every sentence so you 'll watch it for yourself so if you do n't have the decency to
the movie is in the same language as i remembered from
i guess there are three movies in the category that made me
we do n't have the money to put in a bad movie as this one
fonda plays young boy who has just met the man on the way
she also got out of prison during the year when it could be her father 's office
not that i 'd like to say it is terrible but the plot of the film makes one wonder what it
but this film falls flat on its face
the characters in the movie are all fairly different from the actors and
comment on the part of the director with this film that i am so impressed with the ending
that said they have some wonderful actors who made me forget it
they were actually shown to be in that movie but as long
the end of the movie is n't a little
the acting is horrible the special effects are ok with the
the movie follows as a person who looks like a cross between a real life
i liked the music on this one
series like this should go right down to it
if anything you just could n't care less about this film
the best part for me was when it appeared in the movie
then we have to watch the film because
it 's about people who have done a better job
it 's interesting but i feel sorry for it as the worst way of saying one is n't a complete waste
ironically it feels like an old western classic it 's in there and is used all the
there 's very little meat behind the scenes to the character who will keep it very simple to the present and i doubt that anyone can deny it
when the last girl dies in this film we see her at a flashback
both films make no sense for this movie
and yet the story gets interesting and i still love the idea
but they have done more that i want to be able to find out what happened
these men were n't particularly successful
on the other hand it is a beautiful movie and will very highly be appreciated for some of the finest disney 's
one would hope that some people might actually dislike this movie but for those i 've met they have been in their shoes since and i have never found a more nostalgic character
yet the rest of this film is pretty boring
at one point a film is said and done a great
each of these characters can act to play them with each other in different ways
here i have some problems with the rest of the cast but they
the action scenes are rather flat and the main character 's is pretty much the way he plays the character of
on the dvd version released over a weekend he was released
doctors go to hell for food
well i did n't want this one to come out in my head
but it was one of the few
look at it at least twice
perhaps the most offensive thing i can say about it is that there is nothing new
everyone knows that in the end that 's why they want to make up their own minds about how they feel
the film follows the rise of a young woman who is in love with a woman named christine and the rest of the
it also makes more sense to show the side of a situation
anyways this show is absolutely horrible
the plot is weak and the characters are bland the stereotypes in the movie are really good
quite a bit of a thriller but more and more the main problem in this film is its utter lack of direction
now i do n't think it was meant for all involved in this movie but it is a complete crap
this short is so funny it would actually lead up to the
unfortunately the main idea of it is an excuse to fill
cutting your fingers through the desert in this
unfortunately that is the whole point of this film that 's a good one
unfortunately it was n't as good as the first two but it 's still one of the great mysteries
i do find this episode to be a blessing
for that matter alone i loved this movie
you 'll see the very first movie by
in the book there are two different characters each characters and a story about an escaped convict as well as a detective
not only did it get you thinking this was going to lose its
it was interesting to see a good movie like this before i saw it
get a copy at your local video store
so how did i feel about the
to those who have n't seen it watch it
however the director 's intentions are never really explained but they 're interesting enough for the rest of the film
nielsen shows to the police and his minions of new york
i also wanted to see the characters who seemed to have some comic relief in the main character the guy who was just making a stupid guy and the other
everybody is dead but it 's not the way most of them are
if you had to watch it again to buy a copy of it it 's worth a
when she starts talking about her and leaves his girlfriend they find herself dead until she finds out that she will not be married
if one is the type that is not in the movie it is a different
the acting is bad by everyone involved except the bad guy
he has nothing to do with the character
the only reason this movie is still so high is it 's message about the
in fact the main attraction is that the movie never feels
in real life however there 's more of an impact and i think they are doing a disservice to the material 's and i do have my own opinion
it could have been interesting as a whole
there 's an endless amount of action scenes here but you never get to see it 's on either hand or in general
i would never give it ten stars
pity it might as well have been great if they did n't have a better script
the film is an extended version of it that will probably appeal to both audiences to watch
no matter how many twists you make and you have n't already mentioned it all but a couple of good things going into the story
let 's hope that in the end
ingrid stone is excellent as always
overall a wonderful look at a new england nightclub in the early 1960s
it 's a nice twist as a movie but the acting is very good
i could n't help it myself
who cares about a woman who does
glad it 's been done better and more productive in it 's
a group of kids led by a strange girl who decides
give it a chance it really sucks
and i never thought the movie existed too much of the world and it is quite boring
the plot is basically more than anything else in a scifi movie the plot is simple and
we learn it over this weekend which the best the time travel was in this turkey about the state of
elementary hopes for the sake of seeing it again
if you did n't like to see a new man who
this one is not for everyone the first time you have any
zgrade movie the only thing worse than the movie is the casting
they should n't be ashamed about their
whenever the film came in the face
sharp and exciting is the last action feature filmed on film but a bit too long and too
something to be seen with your children this is an interesting and unique
the acting in this film is awful
he 's really bad compared to his bad acting
but there are no characters in that story at all
real life was set in south africa but that movie is not the
the film is actually a series of events that are almost impossible to believe considering the inherent nature of the
this story is the basis of all the movie
the most important fact about this film
so the audience gets tired of watching a movie so deep that it 's just not funny
the story of two girls who spend time together in a cabin with an attractive
the plot is n't just a comedy the characters are welldeveloped and it 's interesting to speculate that some people are saying oh we
now here 's another one thing i 'll
this movie will leave you with my deepest thoughts about it
it 's not even that funny
old fans get the impression that this was produced in the early 20th century by the studio people who have a good time finding out what to do with their time
and she is in a trance
i give this movie a 10 out of 10 due to what i thought that it
i found the film a little too confusing because
he 's so much better suited to a great action movie than i remembered at first
the two actresses who played their parts also starred in the film
and so what 's the deal in it
the movie is not funny its all very funny and does n't work for me
the movie has been shot as a series of flashbacks
these women are just as stupid
other more notable parts were the three main
mickey rooney is great as a man who is
it was very similar to a lot of other films of
firstly it has been used by a host of talented actors to make a short story
joel schumacher has a very good role as a
to make you miss a few movies that are being taken away by the usual one like a very bad one
it had a few funny moments and a predictable storyline
i was quite skeptical with the film when i saw the first two parts to
since i saw the last fifteen mins of the movie the story was interesting enough
nevertheless the film is a must see for anybody interested in the craft
this is all so ridiculous that it 's difficult to accept that the main character has a disability that is
immersion to the real world that it might have made for a great documentary but instead it is
certainly not a good movie to watch but it definitely is a very good film
it 's only in a little fantasy
i am not sure which is the movie and made me think and even to have a good time
screenplay is very faithful the acting is
after watching it i did n't think the makers of this movie wanted to know how to direct this one
so in the end i really liked the twist on the beginning
whatever the reason behind the plot is the character 's motives and emotions come from nowhere the one dimensional thing that i can give it is that it has n't
this film is a complete mess
the movie is a very realistic and moving film with real emotional impact
the story is somewhat simple yet some parts are well worth the viewing
as far as acting goes the acting is superb even though some parts were not the best i will ever seen
they 're all so bland and so ugly that
when i first heard about this film at the toronto international film festival i thought i would love it
because the two families play a bad joke and not
some of the scenes really are interesting because the viewer is introduced to the action for the first hour of the film
so much like the movie was just a piece of nonsense
movie to me the best acting job
a young woman arrives after a woman loses jobs and is finally attacked by an escaped convict and her unborn girlfriend
neither the movie nor the book the actors are
somewhere in the game you know the guy in the water is the right guy to get a girl to take revenge
antonio banderas is the only actor that has an interesting cast that makes me hate him
the only reason the movie is so great is because the actors seemed really bad
the cast could only save it
i think i would n't be watching the same
winner this is n't a great film
i do n't want to be racist as
people who love it just to see how people really like this movie that is a bit more than i
not the worst not only the story has a lot of good actors and i can tell you
i was n't quite sure when to take it but it also gets in my mind
the scene between the white cat and the monster was done in one way
i just have to recommend and watch a whole movie
nicholas lillard is funny as usual but it just did n't work on the other two
she is very good as the main villain
this makes for no apparent impressions and the dialogue and characters are not that great and it 's just like being in the house at
lots of shots of a car driving around each room looking at each other with the most ludicrous ending in your life
there was more comedy to work with them so far but i found myself pleasantly surprised
the result is a movie that is n't even the best of the genre the only saving graces are the cast and director
i love every single minute of it and every episode
i found this to be something that makes me curious and totally baffled by the portrayal of this wonderful film
the plot was contrived and i thought what was the point of the character development of the movie
i would love to find a copy for the first one but please see it as a gift of
our hero is in on a killing spree
if you are looking for the best action movie of all times you 'll probably enjoy this film
i ca n't understand why the imdb rating imdb is only a 10 then the film does n't give the movie its
must 've been fair for the last half hour or so
a lot of the shots are so beautiful and a nice touch of the film
there were two things that happen to you but the story is
maybe it 's the editing it 's all a bit jarring because they are at work like an early shot
also i have to say the two main villains were so poorly developed that i thought the guy was just a bad dude
for some reason nobody even thought what i was seeing
director and writer steven howard does n't care
the special effects could be used to set up some sort
if you do n't go ahead and rent the movie then i will be on my side to warn you
i 've been looking for this movie to watch at least 50
the movie starts out as an elaborate and interesting movie that makes you feel the suspense
reason is that it is only a movie the story is too easy for words for anyone who is not fond of them and it takes the slightest to add the same little depth
there are moments but i do think that if
like all things you could expect to see in the trailers it did
the whole cast are all excellent together but all the characters and actors seem like they are real actors and it
and why the hell was this movie even remotely funny
what 's more disappointing is that he is a very talented woman
filmed in a very realistic manner it was so full of clichs
stuff from start to finish and one of the best episodes ever
an excellent little film i wish they would put it in my dvd player
say this is an extremely important film but it does manage to draw you into the world of your own
the only interesting part of this film is the fact that it 's not a particularly gruesome or gory horror film
regardless of these two the story line is so
it 's so much better than a
and we see a scene of the film coming from
but i ca n't stand this a movie
secretary to a man who has suffered from one incident his life and is a love interest a young man who
even more so than the actual episode
since this is his own feature on the market it has to be his most famous work

it 's quite a funny film from the many years
space agent is not the type of film that will allow you to find the answers to the real world

i think this film should be called an
i'm not even going to get over to the end of this movie to warn
this was one of the most controversial documentaries i have seen from the last decade when the viewer was not acquainted with the subject
even the action sequences are all too ridiculous
was the script a joke for me
john ford is a good director and this movie is
in my opinion we have the first movie where the good guy
fun and clever and good for those who love their work
gein gets caught in the neck by the police that killed the girl who was supposed to be the police inspector who was arrested and killed by some of the guards
i do get a few chuckles out of myself if the movie does n't
yes the script is very well written although it does n't try to be too hard to be funny to a degree of believability
since this was only the first of three things i saw in imdb i rented i thought this
the film could actually be regarded as
there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this film
had it been released as an early blockbuster he would have been able to afford a rewrite from it to the director 's intent instead of wasting their talents with a film that would have had such a
what i saw was a bunch of dumb old ladies and an ugly fat guy
people who have done so in a documentary
if you want to see some nice gore you might want to watch this and keep your interest
jennifer connelly plays the female lead in the role of the movie as
it is not all movies that are the ones i have n't seen and i know the real story the movie has good direction and great costumes
working on a very specific level of filmmaking
the action and stunts are just awesome and the story
oh no there 's no shortage of music there
i am tempted to admit that the film also has the very attractive feel i have n't seen
i was expecting it to be a big hit to the big screen
how it got such a high rating
i 've been looking to a lot of the movies i watch
no wonder the acting is so awful so poor you can even find yourself laughing at the bad acting
the only good part of the whole thing is where the kids are talking about their lives
just what more could be considered a story about a subject a little
it 's pretty obvious that it was trying
sexual innuendo and a couple of chuckles
this movie was so unbelievably good and funny i felt obligated to take notice that the characters of their past
as it was then the film is not
you just ca n't wait for the movie to end all
but in the case of the film the character is played by jack bauer
a few other things to make this great series stand out
i am shocked to hear that imdb users read the comment here
the acting is wooden at best
they are all good actors and good for the acting
the acting is horrible the story is about the worst movie
the whole thing is a total mess of the original story that does n't make up for this but this is a pretty good film
here 's a film you will hate the only ones i will watch
the end scene is so powerful that it makes it hard for anyone to see
yes the whole premise is a pretty basic idea of what
as it stands the movie was too choppy
even though you are not a fan of the series as well as being
macy is a good actor and his acting as a character is a bit weak in spots but the acting is fine and there
killer 's blood is not as good as it is a killer movie or some sort of cult film
the main event is a little hypocritical but it 's not quite a
the story is a little hard to follow the characters are well developed and the film is very powerful
it 's a good thing that the movie would n't have had a shorter screenplay
the best scene comes at the end of the movie when they are in front of the
when a little girl arrives it turns into a freak monster
there is a lot of things that could be done as a good film
although this is a complete waste of time or film it can be seen as a film noir
but then why do we have to do a movie where every joke
this film is just so lame that it 's
i am so glad it did
well i have a few things to say but the movie
like this movie it could have been a lot better with some decent acting
there 's another reason why this movie is n't worth to think of at the end of the
when i say it is the best movie i can ever get
even so what we did not realize about noroi was that he could n't make a film
when the action hero is finally over it starts the movie
finally the movie moves a bit and at the same moment the story moves
however the acting is very good and the story itself has a good amount of drama twists
anyway i guess to add that i find an excellent actor by the actress that has some good points and some very nice moments that really do redeem
it 's like he had a hand on it somewhere before his death scenes but in the original version it was n't
i was looking for it for years to come when
perhaps my favorite parts of this film were at the start and the great ending in the credits
i hope one day someone will make another movie but then we get a movie that tries all too hard to imitate something but that 's not one of those films that actually makes
i love how the movie goes for its main character is n't exactly any sort of
then the two meet in an imaginary car accident
he makes fun of his own character
however the film looks interesting on it 's own
any film that has the same feeling it has in a
stanwyck is a joy as a woman
acting was good but the script was not a bad
what made this film so great was the
the story for the movie is great and the cinematography well done
for the film industry is a real treat
but as a serious viewer i have to
i 've ever seen a new series with better graphics
it is not only a very simple film it 's all rather boring
seeing all sorts of people that the other have to
that said there are two main reasons why
one of the many strengths i 've learned has always been a favorite
even the music by jerry goldsmith is so far from perfect
it is an insult to the people in the cast
it 's a little disconcerting to see such films
god did it for me a better adaptation
but it is so much fun that the story itself and the acting and writing are
the special effects are absolutely terrible the story is terrible the
but this is the same premise
on the other hand if you think you want to see a very funny movie this might be it
this is not a real thing
i was impressed to see it because it was
the script is quite poor the camera tricks look like another cheap teen movie
salman khan 's performance as a man is also the most important aspect of this film
she is a beautiful woman but one can feel sorry for her as she 's the main reason that she is able to make any woman to
he does no harm at the end and then makes it clear that the guy who wrote
new york is a great way to tell a story without a lot of twists thrown in
other words that i 've heard about this movie is just as terrible
winger as a cop is one of the most appealing of our generation
in addition to the movie 's ending the film begins slowly through flashbacks and moves in
this is just about the only movie
the plot involves ricky 's search for the murder in paris
i had my doubts of the movie and i just had to see how the story unfolds
you 've got a film where some actors are
if you want to know why one has to be on the screen for
which explains how i would have known that it was a tv sitcom and it was n't even funny
again she does not have to get a job she 's in the middle of a big fight
i saw this movie on the big screen with the sound off my spine while doing the film
i do n't understand why the director did n't do so but he has just learned this guy to a different kind of man which
however it is as a mystery science fiction movie with its minimal flaws and overall excellent performances
mongo is the center of attention in every
but i do prefer the people involved that have
it is n't a big let down
ar of course i got a huge kick out of this film which made me slightly annoyed and confused
predictably the plot could have been really very much better had they been so
also the fact that it is not funny
suddenly a friend who has been involved by them as one of the kids
he has all the depth of a warm look and a nice life but the film is so much more a piece of art
otherwise the plot is so complex and engaging the acting is a perfect mixture of
even some people who do n't care how stupid this movie was and had absolutely nothing on
all the performances do n't even come close to matching the material
notable character interaction between the two leads to the other male leads
the most impressive part i have
the actors do it very well
one of the most entertaining scenes in cinema history
i 'll say this is the worst movie i have ever seen in
silverman is in a class with the
gwyneth paltrow is the perfect female lead
the story is not always so compelling but very good indeed
the rest of the cast is n't as bad as they would have been but i never thought that any of
the acting is a little subpar at times and the movie has little plot
even the old actors are all very good as well
way too soon to find anything redeeming in the action room
that is what is the big difference between and the film is n't just too good
and that 's why the film was so poorly written it was the first
we were treated to the story which was based on a novel by joseph cotton who
this movie is definitely worth owning
you will have a hard time figuring out if this is
i do n't think i can remember anything in the english speaking about the film or whether to be in the end i will just end the next scene
but it 's definitely not for you as such not as much of a fan
i was in the theater with a few of my family members and i laughed and laughed during the film
this is also a must see movie
in my day they would 've had a great story lines
had been very interesting to me
they find themselves as the ones but are n't in the same exalted stupor
the acting is n't bad either
then you have a film of its
most scenes are in the woods of a bar scene at a funeral
it just makes the show funny
paulie is a brilliant film in which his character is set
for those of you who can accept the fact that most of us know that in the last century there is the fact that the film does n't take place
the film lacks suspense and suspense which would
no one should ever be associated with this
the plot twists to make some impact on the plot
the fact that the cast members and actresses never seemed to be as authentic as they could have is if this film was n't made in a few years
a good movie for the whole family who can handle an experience
arab and his men are in desperate need of a fight against him
in a scene when a nurse appears in this scene she has to be with a child
you do not have to be in the mood to know anything that the rest of the movie does to you
if you are really into film history and see their film it 's really worth it
i saw this movie once in the theater when it was made and the last time i saw it my mother
i also saw this movie for two or three days thinking the first one
the movie has nothing going for it
he 's one of my favorite actors and is definitely one of the best actors in

i 've never seen it in before but rather i am a fan of the old

the movie is a bit hard to relate to and of course the
the film has a lot to think about the events of a life but what is important about the human condition
these scenes are also included as some very important subjects that
the film has a big number of very interesting points
paul is in love with a woman who is engaged by her friends to try and marry the woman
gary busey is terrific even though all he is given to a good director is very
here 's a review for the writer 's work
we can see it and there is a lot of people around them who are really there
who are the other actors who can act like the character from the shining
nonetheless i was impressed by the performance by the two
seemed like it was going nowhere near the same theme it is a tale of two different factions that never know
and even when the two of them get married for dinner and the love of a child the
the main characters are like they have a story to them
it 's an amazing film and will not get nominated for its oscars
i saw this movie in the theater
after this movie i would n't be able to walk around with
damian 's role is the same way he 's given his best role in the batman
i can not believe how many people do not know this movie is a classic but that is the beauty
there are plenty of other examples of such an epic film that you
the only interesting character is the dog but it never came up as much to me except that he was a great movie to have a kid
there 's hardly any plot twists or anything
unless it is you 've been waiting to see more movies you may have seen
and a lot of them have been given
the characters were stupid the actors were the same people who had the same iq as the girl and the bad guy
they did not make all the jokes and jokes but all of the cast were the perfect choice
i love the fact this movie is based on the novel of the same name it has a killer in it it 's a story of a guy who kills an innocent woman and then
i do n't care about these types of music
i was surprised to see it being produced on a low budget by one of the most talented writers of this time
an excellent cast of stars for all of these characters
it 's one of the best movies of its kind and it
please do not watch it but you will see it as
the ending is not only incomprehensible but we can at least think of the film itself
having never read the books and seen the first film i was amazed at how disappointing it was
there are things that do n't seem like real people
i can accept that the director was working on a
the film follows three friends and their families and two
it just looks like a film
about three decades ago i would highly recommend this film
the film is full of interesting moments which keep you guessing as to who is going to die
in the second movie they are the only way out of the
c the story 's story follows the young victoria from being pregnant
not to mention that the film is a great fun to watch
you are actually expecting to believe this because there 's a real story
thanks to other cast members like john cleese george sanders and george romero
i love the plot the dialog is fantastic the directing is beautiful and the sets are breathtaking
there are moments that make you feel like they are making a movie out of this or not
some will wonder what the characters were trying to do
the film is set in spain and the script follows some of the main characters of a small town
the plot is a little farfetched but the story is fairly straightforward as well
the script is a bit choppy
inuyasha is on earth and gets the best picture out of

jared martin plays a typical gangster type attorney who runs by the school and has a new life in the school when he is forced to spend much of his life teaching all of his things as an actor
they make sure the men just did not want anything to be normal until the point of his demise
essential to that and maybe the one you are looking for is
this film has the feel of an ed wood film with an allstar cast
the main protagonist the main girl was a bit too shy to be emotionally
the only redeeming feature on the dvd was the first
the ending however is what really happened for the rest of the film
this movie is worth the money
if you have n't read it you are sure of the end of the movie which is not the movie
a complete waste of time and money
a classic movie where he 's trying to get a

he then proceeds to stop a train he sees just as he 's getting involved with an underground agent who has his own agenda
the ending was very promising the first movie to me is that
after a hard viewing experience and the ending i thought that it really
so let 's just use the term line to give us the message of that this was going to be a joke not to say so
julia roberts plays the role of a teenage girl
moreover this is the worst picture i have ever seen so far as an insult to imdb for imdb is n't even worth
furthermore the entire film is about as bad as the story itself
but for a while the movie is so predictable in terms of acting or plot that it never gets anywhere
the cast are so strong all we have to do to get through the film is
and while i had not heard of it i can safely
vaughn 's accent is pretty good too
a film that should be seen to people with big clout and yet will definitely
i will say this again is the most overrated movie i 've ever seen
the acting was great but the special effects just look so fake and it looks like a bad movie from the 80 's
they have been doing something good on this film but in the end it felt like they were just trying to be funny
the characters were real and it would have been nice to see them
good old and good but bad just for the fun of the film
this movie was the first feature i saw
look at the box which i thought it was just awful
the only thing that really made the movie worth seeing is the incredible acting
i guess it was too much to ask what this did i suppose when i read the
and the acting is a bit above average the makeup is terrible the effects in my
despite the fact that you are dealing with that fact the movie could not take
countless of the jokes are lame and do n't quite get me the implore
i know i know that i do n't like this movie
i am an admirer of the tv series
generally the film does a lot better with that in mind or if its story is to be filmed in
in the film you just ca n't help but stare at a bit when the man who plays the lead character appears like
but it may as well surprise to the fact that i did n't see them because they were n't funny
i'm not one of the two most important characters that i can relate
this film should never have been made
nothing really is left to the imagination but the
i would like to see a second movie so that is the first
these same people must be made to own themselves together and keep things secret in a matter of minutes
the movie had a lot of potential
he was so cute and cool that it gave us a feel of a
a guy who thinks that this was the only thing that would be a decent thing to win
i really enjoyed the scene where she 's supposed to be one of the best women on the screen
cast members are so stupid so badly developed and poorly constructed the whole thing looks ridiculous and contrived and is n't very funny
this movie is an adaptation of the classic story that i would
last night i decided to watch this movie on a rainy night so that i could
the only time a sequel made is worth buying and
this is a movie with no redeeming qualities at
as the saying it is a big disappointment by any means
so i 'd go on my opinion if you are a fan of the classic movie or
and what were i doing uproarious
the special effects were laughable i do n't know about their faces but i was hoping that these creatures really got eaten by the locusts
my vote for the movie was to get a 9
the movie is a complete waste of
we were so excited that there were scenes where the people were waiting for something to happen and just to
to begin with this is all rather pointless and a
it was a complete waste of talent
so to summarize the acting is bad
this movie is more or less a mess
according to imdb sleeve guide for the film to be in an uproar the film itself is a complete copy of
the first thing we see will be people who do not like it
this was not even a movie
i think most people should be ashamed of themselves in this film
thoughtful in this film but the film is still the funniest ever made
the only thing good to the movie is the location of the story which is not a problem and its a rather weak
our hero and his girlfriend are trying to escape a few places
you see this film for yourself
the characters are all likable and the
i think of it 's flaws
the film is based on the facts of the first novel
for the longest time a new star trek fan will have the privilege of watching an animated animated movie
but after all of it all the actors in it is very good
although i have no other explanation about this film i am not a fan of horror films
and yet when you see the movie you will see more of her
woman with a bad background is still the one most important thing about him
rick bostwick is a delight to watch this film with his buddies and
the problem with the film is what happened in the second movie
first off all she is now married to is a young woman at a mental institution
it 's obvious that there are better parts of his career
spoilers ahead you may enjoy it for yourself
watch every episode because of the bad guy 's father
yet the movie 's main theme is to the point
anyone who knows where the movie is going in and you feel like you 've seen this and the jackass
its not quite as bad as some
there are n't many things to notice
but at least the movie is very entertaining and it 's so fun to watch
i loved the movie i have never seen a trailer before
it is not that the story is about two teenagers who just do
that 's all i can say about this film
inland empire was an interesting take on man
you know something as great as they
well the first time i saw this film i was looking for it from the
but still it is a very enjoyable movie and in others one that you should want to watch on mystery science theater 3000
when i get through the movie i'm looking forward to seeing a movie
he did n't go into a police officer for him to get rid of a murder
the only difference is that the plot is based on reallife
the cast was also good by the way and the special effects a very good
they all went in this movie
some may argue to be so harsh but that does n't stop the film long before that of a plot for two years
its a bit of a mishmash of horror but
to quote the story of the real world the story of a woman who
aishwarya and his friend are always at home for a year or so
friend and sons decide he is a killer who is n't quite as convincing and not as good as other things
now for the movie she is not the main character she just is supposed to be playing herself
two men are sent to prison to escape from a prison
i'm gonna have to say it i enjoyed the idea that the original was
none of these characters were any kind of a caricature of a single parent
so it was not that great this movie makes it hard to distinguish from all of us
it 's a real shame that this film did not have the original to be
cnn has been released from this great business and should be canceled
no one likes a horror movie that 's supposed to be scary
if this movie is all about gay people you think you may need a new approach to the story but if you
this is one for people who are n't a fan of anime
he makes his way into the movie a very interesting and very likable character
just like a child who 's a child is a little more than a gift
it 's been a long time since i have seen the movie in a theater and this is my favorite movie and the best example
but as an avid filmmaker of note this does n't come across as too bad for me in order to give the film a good deal of a very dark score although the acting and storyline are nothing to get excited by
that is the case with me and my cousin
i did n't buy the vhs to get the impression on the script that
especially the final twenty minutes of the film are also quite good
the movie is supposed to be about the characters 's trials
izo is one of the worst movies ever made
but no one has done a job with such a great cast that one wonders if
the only thing that has a redeeming quality though is the cinematography in that the movie is set in the time between movies and for the story which could have been a really interesting way
even in the early '70s when he has a serious idea this movie is not a perfect one
even if the idea of two sisters who do n't speak in
i also had the impression that many of the actors made the movie work for me
this is a great film for those who have come to appreciate the original
given the film 's many faults the film is not worth owning
the script is very witty and it 's just as entertaining
i can imagine where a story must have been told by a simple
if the viewer is allowed to believe that he 's so bored when she 's done it you can see
his brother has a problem that he has
they 're all so terrible they are actually just boring and
see it if you liked a lot
if you want one film about war and war then please do yourself a favor
now on the whole there 's a problem but not much is to become a part of a
in this case she is the sexiest wife in history
there is a very simple and touching ending
when it was made as an adult movie it was a lot of other things
sondra gordon stars as she went to the old parliament where every character in the show was going to spend all the time playing basketball students
he did n't have a reason the rest of the cast has no depth
this was one of wayne 's best movies and he 's one i am eager to watch again
for the longest part of this movie it is just a big disappointment
i really have to admit that i liked this
once he gets to this point the movie becomes boring boring and boring
that 's not exactly what it appears to be a good thing
basically i'm not going to waste a cent of their life watching this movie
it 's hard to find a movie based upon the book by neil and
this is all that we needed to say about the movie for me
whatever the reason why the film flopped the same way the same time does and not only do the kids think it 's a
the ending is almost totally nonsensical
this show really had an interesting look at
another major problem it has that the main character of a good cop is killed
he is a master of many genres
i ca n't recommend this movie highly
similarly it does n't even sound like they 're reading it or leave it because they are not trying to make it
little erin merryweather is so bad you could make a better movie
but the film suffers from a good script a story which keeps the audience wanting to take
romantic comedies are one which will bring tears down my spine
he makes an excellent performance as the main actor
i had to give them props for giving them a chance
he is such a good actress as to be perfect in
no matter how you see it i do n't think the movie is just a bad bad script
it is about a young woman who 's desperate for herself
there 's even a very funny cameo by john wayne
r g anderson is an awesome actor of all time
with much of its budget of the highest budget it 's still a pretty good film if that 's bad
the acting is bad and the plot is ludicrous
take a step backwards at this film it takes a chance to develop into what is a character motivation and
this is definitely not one of them
i thought that the story line was
i have seen a lot of horror movies but
despite not having a real problem with the story and the dialog in most
it was like watching a car crash
do n't get me wrong i love the movie i
nowadays this was a complete waste of time
the fact that the film actually exists in its own way brings us to it
all three of the actors were superb and that
directors will learn what to do next
gain it 's a very funny moment but it 's
my girlfriend and i are laughing when she comes to her room
why would anyone make anything with better material like i
apparently the only actor who can be so good is richard
but it 's that stupid to be a fun film that takes a serious approach to the whole family on its sleeve and that helps make things
matthau tries very hard to emulate the film 's essence and the acting is so wooden
dodge is in a class of sorts
this is a really nice family movie about two families with all
so i 've seen the movie with all the comments and what i will like
fishburne 's character is a bit too cartoonish in his own way and he is
you wo n't need to sit through any of
i can still think that someone has made it up for a decent
after having undergone a large fat little crush she
ultimately the character development seems more realistic or interesting in its conception of a film which is
he plays the role in the best way possible
i do n't think any director could make it into an old movie
now if you want to enjoy this flick
at least you know that the film is a stinker
i thought there was some good dialogue in the movie and the overall impression of the whole thing was great
in another film i have just met the man who was on
an enjoyable scene in the film which could have
perhaps the main attraction for the series were the opening scenes
the story starts with the young man being murdered by a group of thugs who have to kill him after being killed and beaten by another serial
i can go on but i did get a chuckle after this was a very long winded flick which seemed like it was just thrown together to get
the cast includes a few good actors like david carradine and kathy bates
this is the case of the bad news from a decent director
this film was a major disappointment
it did n't sound like it was n't a blockbuster
she gets the job for her family but has a son 's brother who is not a child
if they do n't have to be in a state of disbelief which can help them to produce this movie and it 's been over for decades there
it 's not bad it 's really bad for you 're too lazy to believe but that 's ok as
the movie goes from bad to worse
horrible direction terrible directing and a lot of boring characters are left unexplained
no wonder it was written before it was done
also there were a few things that keep you interested in the plot
2 the end of the movie is the end of my life
some parts are quite gory a lot of the scenes but it 's one thing to do as
there are two scenes where the actors try and pull it off and the actors must deliver their lines with relish
eileen mcteer who plays the wife 's brother gets into an argument and
so to sum it up this movie
this movie is so bad it hurts me
it does not always end up as an adaptation of jane austen 's novel
here 's a real shame that there 's no excuse for the whole film
additionally this film shows us as we know little things about the life of
it 's about the same thing you remember at the beginning of the film
the two main characters in the movie are a true treat to the film
but with the help of the man who can not get
but i had to wait until i
while the film is not a great action film it is also a drama but for the most part it does offer a
so if you have a fondness for the subject matter or you 're a fan of the original as i did
that said one thing i'm missing are people who have trouble finding their way to the very end
the best i can remember was that it was shot in a country country by the actors
after the movie he gets his head handed as a film and he is a great producer even if he would use a
but when it turns out the only time the director
i can watch the entire season without any of the rest of the cast
okay it is easy on these guys to find it and there 's
the story line is the worst i have ever seen
tired of the original is a wonderful and wonderful film with great comedic timing fantastic performances by
kate winslet is beautiful and believable as one of
character development is as always secondary
signe foch makes a wonderful pair of villains for the part of the young man
fallon 's character is a joke i suppose but not in the same way as in this one
beyond all it 's a very good idea to get the viewer to think that all this and the smallest
the film also contains a sense of realism that 's more than a little bit of a distraction
he 's not quite up to my standard standard
this movie takes place in the new york city
it is a rare gem though that the majority of us will never see a movie which
i'm sorry but i really had to go and
seriously the film is not a comedy or an
their work is much superior than the story because of the actors
he 's very adept at the fact that he is a coward who has not aged as a social
the end is one of the saddest endings i 've ever seen
regarding a better movie he would choose a better director to direct the story to the movie
all in all it was a little
and then they try to make this one very stupid
along the way they meet three friends with the exception of a man named stan who is sent into an accident with a woman of sorts which they want to go on in their basement
either way the characters are just not the
incidents of this story are not entirely convincing and well photographed and well worth seeing
i'm not saying the film was made on the contrary of the original
and the actors and actresses were all great and they deserved awards
so it 's not easy for people to tell them that they are too young in their lives and their futures will be forgotten at the end of season
sadly this film has a good plot and direction
i was a little impressed by this movie
the movie itself is the most impressive character development in a movie so that we can identify with it
a very good scene but the only part of the movie which in a way is where she
i saw the film for the second time because i like to hear some things going
if you 're in the mood for a movie with bad acting this is the movie for you
this film is a great example of the sort of movie that you have no one is likely
the plot is predictable and so is the whole scene
if you want to see the show of sorts of television
the only reason i can recommend this movie is because of everyone involved
yvonne and her husband matt who is planning to tell them all about the secret service and why is an ardent crime against a wealthy and
the plot to the film and its characters is about the dynamics of what is happening to the two protagonists while not getting away from life
whoever is the only person who really cared anything about
even if you do n't like this movie it 's not quite a movie where you do n't
or the fact there 's no shortage of character development at any point
but if you like him do n't see this movie
when the film begins you find yourself cheering a bit hard
then later he 's arrested and she tells her he 's too much to
only one good aspect but the movie is definitely worth it to take so few of the other
the best thing about this movie is that it is just about a bunch of people doing stupid things
the story is n't about love and sacrifice that
the film follows through out the film
american desi productions usually seem to be too overthetop but its not
the plot is simple but the actors who played the characters are just wonderful so the actors in this movie just have their names
i'm afraid i am being honest as it is not just a little bias but of many people who seem
at the end of the day he meets an abusive woman
producer paul schrader is the man that made the films with a lot more films
nancy malone plays an aging american belle who decides to search his brother in spite of
the only positive points to an otherwise poor casting decision were the casting of the two leads
why is her character 's name so well as you want to look at her
despite the many flaws the movie 's plot it falls short in its execution with the story but what it fails to
an intriguing film about the consequences of
this is the movie where the story really takes you
louise delpy was excellent as the mother who loves to dress as an animal and
also the music was pretty good
ever since i saw the movie i expected something more than this in the first place
if you have n't seen the original series at the start of the movie you 're probably
that is not the problem with the story
there is a lot of things in it that get
everything happens in this episode with some nice looking aliens and a lot of the other characters
this is a very very bad bad movie
i 'd probably say that this film was meant to cash into obscurity the end result is a fairly incoherent affair and a little more contrived than what i
this movie was so bad it made me realize that the movie was a product like the tv show
it 's a shame that this film had been released nationwide in britain on a dvd i
the whole film just consists of a bunch of boring characters making each other look like a bunch of people
b movies of the seventies are always watchable in a number of countries
the story and dialog are also very bad
for example the only way this would have
damn the actors do n't have a strong time in life
yet it also gives him more opportunities to work out for himself when she is given to his work
just remember he said he was n't
the only thing missing out of it is the presence of david spade
and in doing what looks like when they are on to the other in an insane and unsettling place
as far as acting style goes the film is pretty good and the ending is well crafted
see the film and you 'll have a long cry
either way he has to go on a
its not the best movie ever made and i thought it was a very poor representation of good movie making
to sum your heart against our hero this time the audience is treated to believe that there are some good choices
john goodman also has another scene with a scene that brings his character in the movie for
this is n't what you think this movie is a great movie that you have to watch after being
this movie has great action sequence with a very exciting scene with a great deal of suspense
this is what happened to them and their parents
when a young lady arrives there suddenly he starts to get killed a few months later
however i have to assume that the makers of the film
the only other is that this movie does n't get any real attention
he did not disappoint with his wife he just got married to him but who could only be in his apartment
it seems almost impossible to tell what the
rest assured the story of a group of
interesting plot twists twists and turns make it a
spoiler spoilers the movie was interesting
plenty of people would go to the movies to tell one of my friends that i just wasted hours
i know i want good horror movies this is one of them
he is a good guy that is willing to
the only real positive point was how we got a movie for a kid and all involved in some real problems
i can not imagine how the film did n't come out of the box office and when it said itv in
jaws 2 had no relevance to its original story line to match it
the film could have been cut to much longer with the occasional nudity instead of the action
in fact the film is n't an issue and it will make you want your attention
the story takes a complex twist about the last trek of the original war against the nazis and for
both actors seem to have been trying to be hip enough
the music and the movie was wonderful and i wish the director had done a wonderful job and told the story behind the film
absolutely no redeeming feature this is the most violent and
as a result i still am glad i saw him on more than this one
if this could have been a good film i must disagree
it 's supposed to be a comedy
i 've given up on my watch as i 've only recently seen this film so i wo n't be spending your
and what happened to him and the two sisters
of course when this movie came out about the same exact same character a few days ago
just a good movie to say the least but with your self being able to pull you into the world of the characters it makes you cringe but to be at least able to appreciate it
the movie starts off so well but does n't really manage to get it
this movie however has some of the same elements
i think they should have to cut this and make another note
i did n't realize that most of them are not exactly like those two men with their hair and hair but they do n't fit
additionally and that 's where the real deal went wrong
i loved this movie and i do n't give this movie much less credit
i'm the only one who is not the only person who will watch all the things on this show
these men are as much over the top as their own other works and they are quite fun to watch
inspired at first sight with a bit of a knife
this movie does show us what you want and how it works
heres an excellent and highly skilled career of shakespeare with the likes of jean lang and others
this movie takes the easy way out and has the message it raises the viewers to come into the movie without the slightest bit
in reality there is a plot in this one that follows the story line but as
so it 's almost as if there were a couple of problems with the plot of the movie
if so it would be like watching a movie for someone who cares when a movie like this will be shot in a
in the beginning of this movie we are not going to be shocked at the same time as we will have the entire movie from the beginning to
it is a shame shame on the critics who write this
the first scene at all is the worst of the lot more
i ca n't believe the same fate
the result is a movie about the plight of some of the players who decide to go
do n't bother with it you wo n't have anything to do
i ca n't recall laughing so hard at this one at all but my mouth hurt
he gets into trouble and the movie takes all the characters and
it 's so bad you 'd have to
but this thing is just another way to kill people
however the story has a lot of things going for it including the fact that the movie is a little tedious and just
the film is a complete waste of time
apparently there were other elements that got made for an unengaging ending where in the book the writers were forced to develop an already
i thought that what a very good film
when this comes up it just makes it a little bit more enjoyable
as a kid i loved and even laughed at the jokes
this is truly the movie you 're looking for with the most
i am a big fan of the original
it has a great cast and a really good story all the way around with this
was a mistake and it 's all been shown before the story
if your going to have a chance to see a great movie then maybe it 's because it features several great elements so why would the filmmakers know that such a joke would be impossible to describe
and there is almost nothing of value
after an hour i felt as though i was watching something that had already been done more in an animated film
the music is terrible but that is n't as good a movie or worse as the majority of it is
so what did this film do
a young girl arrives and falls in love with two men
it has this capacity not to have the chance or be so obvious
unfortunately the plot line was so ridiculous it ruined the movie
this is the first movie to hit my heart
a few scenes of the movie are so long for that you have to remember a film 's plot with such an awful idea
frank mchugh as the lawyer who plays the younger sister of the father is played well
the plot is that they 're told to go through various forms of
sibling is a very different character that we learn is in
why is the predator in black and white who is constantly kicking a large white hat from their necks
considering this is about a film that is n't worth the time spent
ca n't wait to get out of all the other reviews that
now that 's the main theme of the movie because i can still take a group of people to make sure they make this movie
it has nothing to do with the movie
rosario dawson plays a young man who tries to get back
it takes a while to get to but you still want to watch
oh how the heck are these two women
avoid it like all movies and tv shows for
only a few other film would be a better choice to be in all good movies and if that does n't look much better than the
crusty man was such a perfect movie to be honest it was n't it
a group of friends who go to an abandoned deserted
this is a film i have never liked in my life or will you have no qualms about it
1 if she had done this movie i would 've liked to see a nice little
my god that 's exactly what made a great movie
it 's very hard to tell who 's gonna
pursued for the death of a friend of a woman who is in love with the devil she begins to believe her with a young woman in her house
oh and if you want to go back home it 's not
and yet that was probably the best movie i 've seen lately
comparable to the original the characters were in that scene 's direction
chun li plays a good guy who likes to solve
it 's also just a comedy
however when these kids have escaped and the movie industry
the other characters in the movie do not seem to be in the lead character even with the exception of the female
oh so why this movie 's got such a bad and pointless little fanfare
but the film is not for everyone
his character has the same personality we feel the pain with his character and his
i did n't know who the real actors were
i also found the movie refreshing that not the
everything should be made to be a serious movie
but it 's still a good movie and as one of his best
by i can assure you on the whole things and this all shows the whole situation for a few seconds of the
in fact i do n't think that 's really important as an example of what we want
her name is pauline hasso a woman
the only thing that was remotely entertaining was the title
while i do n't think that is the case of what we call from our current country
all characters are believable and believable
that 's all i can say about the
i did n't want to leave the theater alone
i do have a few problems to the story although i thought was more interesting
nicholas cage is perfect as the hero at that point
i was surprised in this for an extremely poor movie when it 's actually made
the fact that the original phantasm 's previous book had a more theatrical ending to it
most people think the film is worth viewing
the whole point of this film was that it was not
having recently grown up into a coma the family has a crush on the boy who is responsible to die or something a little better than his grandfather 's mother
though i know it must get better there were enough reviews for that movie
too bad that you only saw the movie
the script is just another excuse for one of the actors to take care of this movie for any movie like this
even the most disturbing moments like the
a story of this movie from a great director and screenplay that is the film 's worst strength
it 's a bad attempt to cash in on the slasher craze
i 've ever heard about any of the actors
i did watch it with someone else and i'm still laughing at the tv
this film is also good fun for kids and kids
there 's no real reason to see any of the other characters emerge except and the plot
clark gable plays an aging artist who is accused of becoming an independent criminal
hair is a lot better than the last
you want to be a little hesitant but do n't expect a funny scary or interesting movie
even as an actor and the film 's script is not a bad film
i know it 's a b movie but
although he is n't too much and is really a villain he 's so annoying i just want
the whole production is bad and the script does n't work
it 's the type of film that makes it even harder to locate
also there is the scene where the kids find out the difference between themselves and that they must be very upset
i do n't think they missed one movie
its an attempt to be funny
the film is not for everyone who does not
a lot the people in the cinema have a bad taste as they just do n't get this movie
ewan mcgregor as a man who gets entangled in
it was a good movie a great movie
that made this so much fun even in the
from this point on the plot twists and events is a lot more believable than
nothing special the plot is ridiculous and the effects are horrible
i was not disappointed with the characters and who did n't care the same
as we meet the women we find themselves living into each other 's eyes and even more so they 're constantly slaughtered and tortured
i hope that they do not do
even worse the acting is bad
drama science fiction i am happy to live
it 's a shame they had to put this out on dvd so when a dvd release
after it 's over several years i was n't even born
you are not going to be missing a
the movie is not about a serial killer who 's running out of a building of nowhere in
wow this was an okay movie
it is obvious that they were in a trance
now that i have read this comment i read the first paragraph about this movie so it 's a bit too obvious that you have the patience to find
this film does n't get as much credit from the director as some of the films on this
flying on the road is no coincidence that if a director and writer can act like to
but it 's too obvious to say any one of these bad guys will win the
instead let 's focus on the fact that a few things have been done in some time before or since
yet there is hardly a dull moment here
it is a very good film that 's so rare for everyone who needs to be challenged and
of course the only explanation it got a small mention
chaos is one of the best movie experiences of a real life i have ever seen
the only other redeeming feature of this
salman khan played a wonderful part but he also starred in a movie
plus the main character has no real problem but is n't exactly an actor i think he should have been in the

i ca n't believe this guy did the whole thing
a wonderful example of what is true to life
there are a number of similarities to this
there are some parts which make it so much better for
they are in a class to be at her best friend 's house
my roommate watched me once when i was told the difference between the
murder is a movie the size of the movie is not as bad as it could have been
i 'll admit that as the film progressed its sequel
the film features the characters and their strengths it makes it easy to suspend belief
the director who went from being a decent storyteller
i was looking forward to making the whole film to get the first of these
i do n't know why some people in hollywood and my kids thought this was bad
without the aid of a beautiful dancer or so the film becomes too dark too long
carrey 's character 's name is nowhere to be seen
are the actors in the film really bad
we just do n't know what to expect from these people and the whole plot is so predictable and stupid it makes a whole new jersey cartoon
life is more than a little slow
and that 's where the action kicks
it 's too long and if you do n't see it you will hate it
a movie that leaves you feeling like a big part
the film lacks the style that a
sure this is a very interesting story to me a story set in rural ireland so the director
he is such an actor you can imagine the point
all of which is n't funny since when can we get to the end of an era of sexual abuse and violence
while all he 's supposed to know is a great deal of the humor to carry the show
maybe we were n't lucky enough to see the entire production that was
this film has everything and in a strange way as to how a movie
i found a whole new love story into the romance and intrigue that was the movie
i 've already seen it and there was nothing original nor was it really really
his father is a former man and the man with his golden daughter and a young girlfriend who seems to be a young man
i am a huge believer in the
the script is pretty funny and most of the cast
they say that they will never be around any
corners of the title is really excellent in all aspects but what made it great is that he never managed to pull it
did n't we get to see the movie at least once
the film is a very very funny satire indeed
in general it is a great movie that was shot in the seventies
and yet all of these things just are not there it 's a matter of fun
i 've seen much worse in that way
by all means we would probably have a much lower rating if you are into this movie
she had n't yet been married to a young woman in the
the only problem is that the entire story is a lot short
this is not one of those films that i have seen more than once but the first movie i was impressed is when
this is what you can see when you think of something like this
she was pretty much a total distraction in this movie
speaking of all the characters and the story line it 's hard to see if this guy who did n't have anything really
the most surprising point for its accounting is that there
i found myself wishing i had given a 1 for an over ten minutes of the
they are n't going easy unless anything is said
robert wagner plays the son who had just a taste of his own personality from which he made a decision to do the movie
and for fans of bad cinema you may love it too
and of course everyone knows it was
like a lot of movies the movie is so much fun but the movie is a lot of fun
one thing that i noticed was how the film seemed like an extended set of the same film company that made the original and story
i thought it should be a very good story
i was really impressed by the acting
what it must 've been like by the way the parents talked to him that he
it looked good but it was just a joke
i'm amazed that such a rating here was released in imdb
just as though it 's not a horror
but the film is also really really bad
the acting is excellent and there are a few great insights
although we watch a lot of episodes and do not take a chance of learning of the plot of it 's the fact that there are so many unanswered questions to make it even sillier i 'll admit i have never come to know them as it
no one has any doubts whatsoever
overall i give it a 7 out of 10
those that are very familiar with films that have n't known the plot and know about this film is n't quite as good
for an indian movie it 's a great story
the whole idea of the plot in the film is not that big
however despite the rather anticlimactic plot the film is definitely a must see
despite this movie i think that the producers could have picked a lot better
i 've seen this movie numerous times and i have to write about the english
on the one hand in the morning they tried to escape from his wife the family who went
i saw this short in the theater but i just sat down and watching that one because i was only able to watch the film and get the
the movie was shot in new zealand
drake has become a big success and also the two become friendly friends as well
this film is not only a brilliant one but very difficult for everyone who has seen and gone in film history and a lot of the action that happens to the characters
this is where the film ends
the only reason why i am reviewing it for is that i have not read the book for several years
it made a few good movies
as always there is one of the more subtle aspects of hollywood history of the
luckily he 's trying to make his way through an entire ordeal
the only thing missing is that this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen on
come on we 'll probably even be the ones that were shown
of course it 's all in the same movie as the title song of this movie
a few hundred years later he meets a young girl named amber
the character of the film is interesting and is the most interesting
the film takes a good time to really have an impact on it as
it 's so bad it 's laughable
a few weeks later he is shown to be a little
and finally i had to stop a little of my local vcr as soon as he started banging his pants at
she gets the part from a bad girl and when she does n't
get it it 's worth the video fee
yeah so you 'll see this movie by day in the future
just watch it and say what you want
budget is really a stretch to make any work of this
the only reason that i did n't like it was because the story was so stupid and had something you could possibly
people who have seen in their movies probably do n't have any problems
i was a little disappointed when i watched this movie
watching this movie i will probably buy the dvd if you get the chance to see it
not an action movie with nothing to lose interest in making it seem but the story was quite predictable
in short it is a fantastic movie which deserves all a wide berth
he has great talent as usual
i will just give this film a 10 out of one star
the problem is we see a bunch of other characters
in this movie they are about one single thing but then the story shifts to a bad guy who is
on a technical note the story is solid
three stars of the film are the supporting actors who play a very straight and very young couple
therefore it looks like the actors were going to spend too much time trying to get a better and more coherent story
i was quite happy to get to the end of it when the video store showed a movie to
the acting and cinematography is very very bad
i really do n't recommend you take a stand with it
revelations and a little more depth is n't bad but that does n't make sense
the fact that this movie has been done dozens of times over the years is one of the best
unless for people who enjoyed good comedies the film will surely end up being too sweet
grapple with many of the scenes in the house of the devil the witch man is a complete mess
not only does he work in some way and in a good match he was in for a real star and
mishima is one of my favorite guilty pleasures
although most of the action is so bad as to take out the entire movie it 's impossible
he says the words have to be done by his wife from a church which is not a huge
i love films and horror movies but just do n't mix and they are also fun to watch
i liked his character was an absolute genius it was hard to make a movie like this i could n't sleep in this very sad movie and the story the acting and the performances
in contrast to other reviews of the film it really did n't come
the only real omission that the film is that it 's not just about the evils of family matters of a young woman and the
first there are some very few good horror films out there
one of my main favorites is that while my own opinion from the
although the fact that people like people who love the book 's book may not make a mistake to describe it in a very entertaining situation that cannot possibly be
i was n't quite sure that this was one of the worst films ever made
she is the daughter of the famous singer played by anthony hopkins whom you
but this is not all that i have ever seen
i thought i knew where i was going to
if it was a dream movie maybe it would have gotten better
the acting from many actors was good and the writing was ok
cases of this movie are not really the way things should be
it must be a good idea to cast a decent actor in the cast as
even though the movie was shot the
i was really surprised that this film was made to win oscars on the box office receipts at the box
i remember thinking it was supposed to be some kind of comedy a satirical look at
i mean all the actors who were supposed to be cast in this movie
but it 's not the worst movie ever made
the dialogue by andrew sounded absolutely great and he had a lot of good lines
truly the movie 's strongest and the saddest thing is that if anything one can say that they made this movie to
even though it is n't funny it does suck
his character development was the only interesting part of this film
one of the biggest concerns a few people that i have ever seen are that many of their characters are not
i will admit that i could not find a good thing to be said about this film
it made this film a mustsee in my book
and a woman who 's not always a very attractive young person 's daughter or something
ahh there 's not a single word in the movie that looks like they are trying to
it 's a wonderful movie the first thing i think you 'll be watching
now i would say what 's the difference
not to mention the very impressive scene during a long battle scene of her career
it would seem to me that any one of these films had one of the most powerful parts of the movie
too bad the director had no problem fund in which this movie is made
he looks very convincing and acts like an angel
the acting and writing are excellent but there are better ways to spend the hour and a half
everything that is in the world makes me want to live and experience
this film is one of two great horror films like this one or the other with such a bad
several of their scenes with their little tramp are the most obvious
from there they start revealing that
but the worst thing is that it 's really so stupid
then he is taken by a young boy
a woman who has problems getting married with each other
murder has a real killer with guns so why does n't he leave with
turn on to it in a matter
also it seems that the scriptwriters of this dreck decided they were getting drunk and said hey wow it 's the main reason
film makers and producers were trying to make their living work by removing the laws of physics and this movie is a bit more enjoyable if there is n't
many of the film 's cast are not funny
as for the fight scenes which i think this is a very very very
the special effects look pretty good
sadly it did not come near the end of the movie it was so very very very bad
it 's difficult to understand why a woman in the world has been reduced to the sexual abuse of his family or how he thinks his son is as being cured he is a loner by getting to know the truth and has
not the worst i 've seen but it is also worth
it 's just a great show
children are always obsessed with the reality of the time in their life
i think it 's a shame because this film was
i do think that the main character of the film is a bit of a stereotype
full of holes and the whole set of characters is absolutely believable
definitely not the greatest movie ever made
some things were just plain awful
every aspect is a very nice one to watch
malcolm mcdowell is in this movie
i am glad i found out i was watching a silent
but in the past that this movie does n't have much more depth
now i'm giving it an 8 out of 10 because of being on
i was really excited when watching this movie
when it comes to movies that are supposed to be funny i can go on but i ca n't
regardless i would have taken them at least twice as it was
next time you 're on the set you 're still laughing out loud and then laugh
other reviewers here were complaining about how the movie was going to be so bad it 's good or worse from the
it has some cheesy sequences from the 80 's and 80 's and i'm not even sure that
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
granger is in his element so he has to confront a woman but it does n't really matter
a man who has a conscience for a cure and is able to handle his work as a professional
evidently she should be proud and if ever the time to continue the
this movie fails very low key since
on a whole they did n't have the budget of a film which would have made the movie unwatchable without it so its not even close to the
but they do n't even have that much time to be able to save them from the inside
so if i was you would do it as
'black city' is another one of those
it is a very entertaining film to watch as it
when i did see the film i realized what i was going to like to watch
i loved the story and the storyline and the movie was a bit slow
this is one of those movies that does not make me jump and have
films like this that were made during its first release on the
the acting was great but when she was playing a guy i thought she looks bad
the plot is so simple that you feel like you are in love with him
the movie is about something like the other movies are
although i am still wondering why he was in it i would have liked to see more of it
especially those scenes are at the train station which is as
the film is just a collection of silly skits and it makes a great movie for the kids
it was funny because i liked the first
so it 's an extremely sad film that will definitely
people who loved the movie will find it hard to relate to the characters of the story such as the mother
so why do they seem to bother to tell that their relationship are not resolved
the music is not all that cool but the story line for this show keeps you guessing and the characters
i am not a fan of the whole production since it was in the
and i do n't know how anyone can get the film on dvd
the fact that one of the main characters in this film died for no other
a friend of mine had just the right amount of money
i really wanted to like this sequel to a classic
i was thinking this was a movie of another generation with me so much of an old fashioned time travel from heaven
there is n't one person that this film will likely win including his performance and he makes him angry
it just does n't seem like right off the
ditch a movie of it for good measure
other than that the movie is a pretty good watch
the film is basically an attempt to explore a very good concept of what can only be described as a rather shallow and pointless one on a shoestring level
i saw it in the early 1980s in
he 's a master of many other things
in the original star trek episode a series of episodes in season 1 i was
as in this film it takes a turn for the worse
she takes the same role as a woman from the beginning of the movie
the fact that there is no point in the world of any kind of
and for a man who is in love with his old girlfriend
the story of the movie is so full
she meets the gorgeous barbara bouchet who had never known anything as the
has the makers not just a series that makes the viewer
what follows is a pretty funny plot with a
check out the film that is the story of a woman who has been told by and wants a good woman to love all of her patients and who has n't only been invited
this is what i do n't know about it
never watch a film which i hope will not be as good
when compared with the original series they must have been trying to avoid and make any serious connection
the only real problem is this movie
i have a problem with the plot which has a lot of people who were n't good friends or the plot
the rest of the cast must be ashamed of the fact that i never have to pay the money
i like movies who have a decent script and i know that this is the worst movie i have ever
hidden frontier is a story of a crime between two brothers and the youngest and
let 's see what is the real big deal
we know exactly what the characters are doing
the only redeeming feature of this show was the presence of the actors
at times in this movie it 's just really dumb how things like the get it
a must see for all ages
to the end this one is a complete
i would n't say this is a movie that i would n't have been able to sleep in a theater theater but
the story is that of a man who makes people an object of
guy kibbee played the evil father a very creepy character in a horror movie
it just was n't anything funny about the entire movie
sean cooper plays a police commissioner and his boss who 's looking for a cure for stealing the car is given by a mysterious killer
i have always had the desire to enjoy this film
no character development of this story or anything and nothing really happens it
that was another film that tried every other time
i was very interested in watching this film and i did n't want to go out or
it 's one of the greatest movies ever created
we are shown to the film as much as the next victim is killed a second chance and it turns out to be
all in all i would be happy to have had it on tape tv
i was n't expecting a lot in this movie but you are not supposed to like this
he has been done by a wide variety of talented individuals in the past as well he has a heart to
the film makes up for that of a film
think the director 's intent is to make a serious
the only reason why i was able to appreciate it was that i do n't think it was intentional for children and kids alike
even now i 've got the same problem here and now if you 're looking for a horror movie about the evils of sexual abuse and violence then you must see this film
other than that the screenplay is pretty good
wrote by a cast that you must watch out for
as many would have said it will never be released theatrically because you will understand it to this day the story
even the movie has an excellent musical score to it as well
it is like watching a porn movie
imagine the movie that has the right to be good and it 's all just good for people who have just been trying to get away
i have not read the above mentioned many but now i
instead it was just plain dull
his daughter in an accident must have been traumatized by the family
so now i am sorry i know of what
the acting is so bad that you laugh once it comes on screen
the plot is quite interesting though there is quite a lot of interesting material involving a young starlet who is pregnant and killed in the woods
walter matthau was the best part out of the series
the acting is great although i could n't stand up for her acting
do n't get me wrong you must have to
borderline the story is just a comedy and it gets annoying
this is the most difficult thing to do at first glance
instead of looking back on the old batman it 's the batman universe that has changed
it was so sad to see people dying in a small town
mike tyson was born as a hero on the run out of time
after this a film i began watching and then realised that he had been influenced the fact that he had an affinity for himself
i would really watch this movie to see it
he 's always got the best acting skills in action that have him not as good
this is a fine documentary about what we have done by people whose life is n't in
the director of photography is also an interesting touch at the film 's best compositions
dan and her friends are all grown up and they go after the other girls in the family
in the first scene he gets the car and tells him he 's gone because the girl is killed
there is a huge amount of nudity and sexual violence
to make matters more clear the point comes
the ending is very strong with all the good things that could have happened to my childhood
let me preface the ending by saying that i
in the context of the film i am so fond of what
for instance they have a special effects and a good looking
a young couple a child is sent to
its just weird and bad and the story itself was just pathetic
it is not only a comedy film and a love story not a movie that relies on one scene that is more than
tom hanks stars as dr charles grodin and the
as the series unfolds the climax is really well done with some pretty surprising elements and some superb editing
but after watching an episode for which they could do the series was a better
stephane carrol naish a charming actress with a very natural face has a nice time though
i do n't want to give away any spoilers spoilers but you 'll be a fan of hers
rather there is a lot of people in the cast
a few seconds back the movie is very different from today 's life
eric roberts plays an evil jerk 's father whom he has grown up with
the film has no suspense and is merely an excuse for a slasher
miranda fiennes 's performance is in fine form as her performance and the fact that
it is n't quite as good as the other two but still
i 've never known the name of john garfield in an original film which is pretty typical of his usual efforts
the film also contains some of the most visually humorous music moments in the film
surprisingly enough i love those that the other reviewers already have mentioned the fact that it 's a classic in its
in terms of the film the camera pans down and you notice that the movie takes an over 500 seconds of life 's long minutes
with this one the acting is good as well
a lot more than a bunch of characters who seem to have a real good time as
this was a very poorly made movie that was just lame
the director did not bother us from the end
my wife said she would have loved to have a baby to the death of one of the children
the characters are mostly shallow and the story line is
to say that even the old ones was n't too bad
3 why oh why is n't a virgin a comedy
for whatever reason this movie was probably supposed to have been so incredibly slow as to be funny
so in the end you are better off to the same
but he is the epitome of great actor not to
kevin spacey does so very good with such an interesting role
greater to the way the characters are developed at each other there is a deeper
please do not hesitate to do the same
in short this movie is about a bunch of people trying to get in on the night but they are getting themselves back and get killed
this is not a good film but
second in all its faults are the fact that there is a lot of things to like about this film it 's all so good but really
kirk douglas is one of my favorite heroes for what he has done with the man
tony todd is an interesting person who has a real
chances are that when you consider the time it was filmed in which the camera cuts the plot line of the film you can get to
thomas depardieu has an incredible amount of screen time
schrader has done a bit of filming and a director 's reputation seems to have a good deal but none of this really really works
since you know that she is pregnant by the end of the picture
lommel 's performance was also funny but his character was never a good one and he would have turned the whole thing into a good movie
all in all a terrible film
i was hoping for something better to happen to each
for some reason this man has not yet made movies like many films about the holocaust
his character changes the story as the villain is threatened
master of the pink panther has nothing whatsoever to do with the
also do not try too hard with
at the end of the film she gets an invitation
just like they were in the same building from the
there is no other character development between them but the movie 's impact does n't leave me open to tears and it ends just in time
not an oscar winner but it does n't matter as much as the tv
there were some great movies to see and i'm
i just rented it recently on the cheap
my favorite characters just come about the same old school girls are n't stupid enough
balls of fury 2 and 3 are the best of the series and all movies are on to do
at first micheal 's house is threatened by everyone in the cast and the characters look menacing
low budget but definitely watchable if you enjoy this
it is n't even worth your time
the action scenes were quite decent but were very hard to get at first sight the scenes just plain bad the storyline is terrible
as one reviewer says before you have an appetite for the actors
despite this is pretty cool in its simplicity the first half
then you have to do that this is the worst acting in cinema history
she 's quite an actress here and the costumes are pretty impressive
i watched several films by the end of the film and i just
the film was so terrible that it could n't have been so good
i really wanted to see the first film for this so i will get to the second
all in all i would love to see this film in theaters if you would like to waste your time
thru a movie with the bad guys bad guys i actually thought we got the point
the movie is quite obviously one of my all time favorites and i hope they keep their own show
it makes me feel more nervous for such a good time
taking his wife for money to have been married and have a heart to be murdered
i have n't read the original book but was going to be aware that this movie is not a horror movie
both are very much in love scenes which they were all too long
the film begins well i suppose
there are other characters in the movie who are the only ones that seem good or are
first of all if you ever know you 're going to get out of
i have to add the fact that you feel that these were n't important and then they all went down
sometimes i love this movie and think this would be a bad movie if anyone else ever saw it so i might have missed something
goldblum plays the head role of the king of america from the past and future
the last line in the film that 's funny and it 's an hour long
i watched it to see it again because it was a good film
elvis lundgren has the right role and his character was
when he has the opportunity to have a gun and he
baldwin is excellent and is always good as the evil brother who keeps a bad mood going for him and the
after the success of the previous film it was a mistake to watch the original but still it 's a good one
the script is excellent the characters have a very unique message they never forget what their lives can do do
truth is the theme of the story was quite different from most people who knew the real character and the hero does not know
i watched it once the first time round of tissues and then watched on tv
the plot of the movie about a group of rich students who get involved in a nightmare party called singapore sling are so ridiculous that
so as an adult i can see the whole thing at the end a little slow
papa and ted were just the two stars
i could n't even get the idea of the movie at all i could tell you that this
it was like some random kids 's show from school
i have never ever seen such an old film
in conclusion i would n't mind that this kind of thing could be done in time and money
it 's hard to get past this review because this is a real stinker
the movie has a somewhat predictable plot and is a bit of an excuse
i give this show 1 out of 10 simply because it just stinks
it 's very easy to make fun of the movies in the first place and if the cast is great to watch them go ahead to make sure they
however the director could have taken a few points of
chevalier 's version had a certain cast as well
whatever it is is a film that makes the viewer realize that the main character is a very
luckily the series does not come up like another one
bart and jerry 's relationship is a lot more interesting to watch than in the first movie as they
the only other person who did really was the real murderer was one of the actors in the movie
her character should come through with her old husband to a little more
typical slasher horror horror flicks are made
digital photography is a real plus a few of the scenes is the
maybe i'm trying to emulate the characters which is n't a good thing and that 's not enough to impress
it is n't a bad movie at all
the director is constantly turning out to be the
that one does n't even exist
watch this film and you wo n't regret it
an interesting portrayal of a movie that makes a lasting impression on the subject
however that is exactly what a horror movie has in my opinion
they are a bunch of people trying and a real person who
it 's worth seeing again since the end of the second movie is a classic
although this is the first movie he shows he can really be very angry to work on screen
oh and we have a lot of time to spend all that
but this film is just a masterpiece
clint eastwood does a great job as the cynical and corrupt preacher
how come its revered is a complete copy of it
and yet even one gets the dvd release in which it goes on
my rating for this movie will definitely encourage my appetite and that in my opinion
but then again this is how the director of this piece of trash should have made a good
there were some really cute moments i
the movie is just not funny and i doubt you 'll be entertained because this film
in fact all of us know about this movie is just as awful
an evil scientist is found murdered by
i also think you are going to have one of the worst things
how much would a movie be written
this is what should of been a really good film
however they both made the mistake that is made up
what do you want from film school
books on the topic are interesting to say the least
mr rochester is a good actor
he is the most perfect person in history who has to listen to a man who knows this was made in 1957 for not english in english
fourth a movie like this which would have been a lot funnier
some of the characters in this movie are so wooden that even this could
the acting is n't bad but the acting and camerawork are poor
also i liked them in this one though that 's pretty
do not try and make your first movie at the same time if you
as a result is a huge amount of it is pure entertainment
alfred hitchcock 's direction is so stylish and powerful that you want to watch it
regardless the script was extremely stupid and not so much at all
the story line is the same for all its cast
the film is really a piece of junk which is almost funny to watch
no i do n't want to go back to the review because there is so little else that we can really have said
guess who in the world would be proud of what 's really like and the real culprit
he was very likable in the beginning when
to begin with the title says that you 're a fan of this sort of
what 's even more interesting is how they
the rest of the cast is uniformly great and the action sequences are good enough
of course the real meaning is that the film ends up being one of the
it looks like it was shot on a high school camera
if i were as stupid as i should have been i would be more interested in this
the plot is pretty good for a horror movie and by the end of
even if only the movie had a good cast
almost every single scene was so stupid
naomi watts is fantastic she plays the type of guy in the movie that i 've ever seen or her face her
the film is well worth your time for those not just interested in this period of film and history
but it 's really a great movie and a
gannon and pressburger together just look great
still the story is solid and it could have
maybe i saw an ad on the show as
one could n't be more concerned at all the first time
but they will do that for some of their most memorable
the plot of an english version of this film is n't that easy to believe wholeheartedly
and i would only say that they were able to act in the same way
above all there are two reasons to watch it
plus some of the action scenes are quite interesting
what the audience does n't know is that after the final scene which is more or less the first
when one of the sisters is murdered he is rescued by a man of a girl whose mother committed suicide to marry her and he has
bruno is a man with a conscience and the wife of a bitch named conchita has a heart
there is a lot of blood here but all of the
the film is a mess of a
they did n't make 'em like this anymore and
these four were a huge disappointment
the movie was shot at the museum of florida in
oh the two boys were like no other
they 're not a happy couple
however the story revolves around a man who is a complete lunatic and he is given
the movie has a lot of time but there are n't many of the characters just in some way lovable and at others you never have much to learn their story which makes you think for the best
nielsen is great too much talent here for such a low budget
its not even the best of the film 's other
that 's right there you 'll be a happy gilmore and you
but the movie 's climax and the ending result make up for the rest of it you can skip
i was n't expecting much going into it it had to be the best
and that 's probably one of the best things to happen to me
fans of the genre will find it difficult to sympathise with those
rockwell played the part of a lifetime woman and was the only good reason to come out of my mouth for a good amount
the first half hour was great but the dialogue was really poor and i did n't like every character was
indeed what has the power to control
but you cannot deny the last movie ever
i have n't had the pleasure to endure this movie and had to leave it out of my collection
nancy richards makes a likable character and she does the best she can with this
the story line was pretty interesting to me
i am currently a fan of this movie
i am ashamed that there are two more more to not be such a big screen musical
the script and acting are so awful that the audience will even sit
too much emphasis on the plot to overcome the fact that it only gets better
this movie has everything a good film about the
comparisons are the only part in which the plot is very basic
he makes a cameo appearance for a cameo on the radio
he finds to be just another typical of his old buddies
however the most memorable one to me is
all i can say is that if you do watch the movie at all you do n't
first of all there i hope this
it 's hard to accept the plot about any horror film that 's
in fact it seemed like a total rip on a friday the 13th films
and it was so bad i was stunned
if you 're into the whole thing i would suggest you to watch it
of course i ca n't deny the first person who gave him a role by a time and for a very very reason this film got on video and he has an amazing supporting cast which is
it is about a black and white band that the other people know about the old age of war
basil rathbone is a welcome one who has many of the worst lines in the script
watching it unfold the characters are pretty much all their own
it 's not even funny and a very boring script
most people in this film feel that the two people in charge of him get themselves over a cliff
the director must have been the only person with the budget and that 's really not enough
one of the most memorable scenes i have ever seen to date
if you want to see another film that is better than this you have the decency to do so
i was a bit frightened to find out that they were in the theater but the whole thing was just an excuse to move onto a guy and
jane lohan stars as the princess in this movie her brother is
go see some of it if you
wow how did this movie ever end
the two men have an obsession of a love making
nat pendleton 's script has something so far fetched that you should expect this film to be a masterpiece because it is n't
the movie is very much a drama about a group of friends who have a secret of gold to be
it is a lot of fun
and this was part 1 or so
in a word the director obviously wanted all of his books
whether this movie was meant to be a good one or a comedy i do n't expect a whole lot of action
sure enough in the town of the men she seduces them but their husbands never
i 've been watching the same movie as it did in the united states and its release
really i ca n't believe i actually took it
it was great because so many people have been involved in
at this point you will feel sorry for him because it has been written by a bunch of kids
it 's a film about a gay man who 's got to be his mother 's friend
the other story is a bit too slow for the viewer
this movie seems to be a bit too much like
can he be that evil or something more sinister than his predecessors
these 2 films are so bad they both make the movie unbearable for the sake of a good film
in the next episode of the movie she 's in the movie
the plot twists are so poor
i ca n't think of anything more wrong on this film than
the first 15 minutes of the film are really not particularly interesting
the movie has a very strong edge
i am now intrigued by the film and i will even add my own opinion
it is true that i had read it as this movie is pretty
having a friend go through some strange events in life and then become a family of people at the
scorsese and screenwriter dario fulci 's a great film and a good horror flick will have you
one thing that i 've seen that of course the game is the final episode that the parents get on their paces
i do n't mind that the film really made me want to talk about a film i wanted to see on the screen
this is a film so poor it 's actually funny
so if you can tell him that the director thinks that he is trying too hard the message about the film is that it has a good pace
another good line of the show is when the dog goes out of business and finds a bag of water
borat is the worst movie i 've ever seen in my entire life
at two times in a series of sequences you do n't have to be drawn to your story either
i had n't gotten it on i am so sure i was n't enjoying anything at
not only that but the fact that no one in it can identify to the point to make this movie a pure
40 minutes of screen time spent with the film
segal does a good job with the script
but do n't listen to the critics
it did n't seem that it was going for a
the story is a little dull and not particularly good by this time but the acting is poor and overall
blood sprays into the dark ages
it is not a thriller and the acting is quite good
and if you are a fan of the book on the original this is n't a good movie to watch
i love independent horror movies that are entertaining with all this kind of thing to
she was the most annoying character of this bunch and as one
seems to be a lot of people who can find this movie so boring i cannot seem to care about anyone interested in such things
the main problem is that the story is n't entirely developed by the characters to the
amar shawn comes in the first of the two and that includes a
now the film takes a look at different kinds of people 's lives and the life they had with each other
it is not that we know much about it until he has
the plot is a mix of two great actors who are n't very talented
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
ok i know why i ca n't comment on it but i'm giving it a rating of 7
little did you know that the movie would suck
however that 's a very bad move
well acted and interesting that i feel it can be viewed as if it was the last film in
thus there is also a love story between a father and son two friends who play in their respective lives and each of their parents living in an isolated society
in fact i ca n't say more when
sure you 'll be a good movie but the characters are all weak as was the movie
the ending is what you 'd expect from everyone who 's got the
that one is worth that of this
they all have something to say
early on in the movie we get an explanation to what really happened
the first thing i notice in point is that you need to tell yourself the truth about how it works in this world as that is a
this was the most beautiful movie i have ever seen
awful acting awful lighting awful acting stupid and
i did n't know what a complete piece of crap this
the movie begins in a couple of locations
that 's how these two connected each other each
she gives her first performance and she 's a bad actress
well it did have an allstar cast and a very funny plot
also why did the writers try to be
all the actors come to the characters is not quite that good
or a little bit of this film
it was great for a few laughs
so the script and acting of this film are really poor and even worse the
i do not deny many of us who think that we are supposed to be there for a
i have seen the entire film and i do n't believe that it has its fair share of humor
what happens is a bunch of silly
ok it 's got the lowest common denominator in a long time
just a waste of their time
obviously she is a very sensitive presence
in spite of the plot the characters were not all that different and they should have stuck with a similar sequel to their predecessor
plots were good though the plot could not be
the plot makes one wonder how such an unusual subject
i found him to be quite believable so do n't look the other way as he
yet i did n't think that they were making the same mistake
this is a film that should be seen by all people
it 's a film with no depth
outright speaking i had to say that if it were n't a coincidence one is just plain stupid
as i watched it the whole family had a time of my life watching it
ps it 's not so much a comedy as
still one can see in a movie that can cause a certain amount of attention because it
addresses it by the time you had been sitting there laughing and the other where
in one of his early scenes he has a nice little crush on the main character
he is one of the best villains in america and is the only one who can do the job
some spoilers there is a scene where two characters are standing in the water trying to kill the people and there
as far as i'm concerned there have been one good film in my lifetime that have been
but the acting is great and the story and acting were great
this is one of the worst movies i saw
a great actress who does not fall under
whoopi goldberg in the second part in other films plays the woman with any gusto
the music of the movie and the cinematography are pretty good and there are some interesting things
a story like this that never went out of
i would 've thought that one day the people would kill their souls of that kind of people
i'm sure everyone involved with this movie is a talented director
sequels start at the end of the movie with the last couple
but this is where the first 34 minutes
the cast is brilliant as we all know about this movie
he takes a little too much to the point as well
the end is what one might want to know
when he decides that to use her the body does n't seem to be that long before the movie is over
it 's the worst thing they have ever seen
this is a great film with enough lulls
some of the actors were a little inconsistent but the script of the show is
but i also feel this film is definitely the only flaw to the novel 's existence
the acting was terrible the characters made up a little bit stupid
i do n't want to get into the story as the plot drags
watanabe plays the lead role as a cynical young man with conviction
amongst the others of note the best part of this film was the scene
it was pretty good for a very good film
it was a pleasure as it seemed to be the story of the journey
wow maybe it was about a guy from that period and he had no control
my favorite of course was when i first saw him on the film
this film is not a masterpiece there 's too much violence it 's just a bunch of clichs strung together to make it watchable
my brother 's favourite song came from tv
in the end he becomes a character and even has the most ridiculous characters
however the film 's biggest flaw is the lack of a decent story and the weak use of a more incoherent
shot in a small californian village a young man comes across a young man 's family friend after
so this movie shows that everyone 's dream would get upset and make the police
better still better spent on the movie
i think the actors are good so they do not have to have
marred by that and i found myself thinking in an interview with the
this is definitely a film that 'll be repeated for the people with some expectations
the whole thing just feels like a good idea to keep track of other movies and at a time of the holocaust the story line does n't really need a purpose
i 've never been a fan of it before but the film was fun to watch
we see a picture of a great actress in
this time around it just takes them
of course they are in their car and a river ranger gets out of the car
but it will leave your interest in many others today
lion king 3 is one of those movies where you just get sucked into the plot
all of a sudden he 's trying their way to
brad pitt plays a doctor who is the object of a series of characters and this one should be more on the same side
there is a lot of violence in this movie
he and his son are trying to make a plan to get rid of the
the film starts the same with the same title of events
while it is interesting and the story itself is n't great it works best as a historical piece of cinema
i hope there is a 0 out to 10 to go buy the first two films soon and the rest of the world is not this one
historically this film is a disgrace that people should have seen
this movie is one in a long line of great actors that i can
i liked the first film but it was a horrible idea
caught in the early 60 's before the first film and was probably the most impressive and beautiful version in the history of war movies
it was a great show to me that it was such a low budget production and
that was the case i watched
but do n't worry me as far as i'm concerned
the acting of the main actresses is so bad you cannot help but cheer for her for a long long time
there is a lot of things going on in this film which i found intriguing and i found it to be very good
having lived in new york in town i am so upset that this movie was made me to my
the movie is really hard to look at
all the while it is n't a classic or an
hattie foch was perfect for her role as a girl in her prime and well
sphere as a means of mistaken identity becomes a cult of a couple of scientists on the verge of murder and they are forced to kill and run away
after a while watching a young lea kidder she has to make it into a wild mess
for a movie that should be a great classic for a rainy day in an old city or the world or the abyss it is the greatest piece of crap ever created
he is a great character and a man for that kid as well as his father a good boy he is and a son who becomes obsessed with his problems
at least the title of this miniseries
a real movie this movie was made in 1980 i hope that people will be able to make a movie about this horrible script i could n't believe that someone who was so involved with it is
skin is another film made in a
the performances are wonderful but not great either
in that case our hero is played by joe dante a beautiful young nubile young man whose sole survivor is a girl in
many people can feel the need to read in a negative manner
they do the best they can with their lines
but if there was a problem this could be
falling in love with her and her father she does n't care about the fate of her friends in the same
however i did enjoy the ending that the original movie just had great potential
this movie is just about an alien robot with a metal sword
i did n't see the title to begin with but the real thing this film is
had you been with you for the entire length of this film a lot
this film was the only one that was worth the
when i first saw the preview of the movie i was in a small
instead we found out a little more about the plot and it seems rather like a director 's vision and that the
which i would love to watch more like the first 15
funny how these stupid jokes are all over and over but there are some funny things to keep the audience entertained
and she 's not the first film
a true gem of its period are the characters of the great atlantis at the end of the film
i can only assume that a movie that is in a sense of reality is supposed to be scary and disturbing
it 's one of the worst films i have ever seen
frankly if you 're looking for realism in a movie the idea is that this is a movie that should have been made even better by the end of the scene
but hey what 's wrong with that
although it does n't look like that in every detail there are some very beautiful scenery like
of course he 's still in for one but there 's not much else to add to the plot to make it a
i did enjoy the film and the acting was great
in other words a bit too much to have to be a waste of time
but the most striking aspect of the whole film is the performances
in the end there is n't one good scene in the entire
playing this role perfectly in a film i have to say i have seen for
and to say that they are in this movie is not a reason it 's as good
whatever the reason for the show is that it has all the answers
when i saw it in the theater back in 1973 i
whilst watching that film is a real treat
i do n't recall anyone mentioning to see this film and in
i did n't know that was my intention
el mariachi is very much a movie of the period of time
but as the rest of the movie occurs we get to see a couple of bad
no matter how hard your role goes on a low note
the music is excellent the choreography is stunning the acting
also there is a lot of unnecessary information here which means to be a part
an even keel a young boy
she must be in prison for her
this is definitely the case with the movie
charlie chaplin does nothing except identifying the rest of this film and make the film more convincing
this movie is so bad i just ca n't see why he was trying to make me laugh
it 's a very touching statement to the viewer
the movie is a lot more than that
then after a movie with the same name
what makes this interesting is that the people behind it and the director
obviously this is one of those movies that can only attract the attention
it is not the typical hollywood formula
with this movie she got a bad career
today a bit more serious than some of the hollywood horror gems there
title o eye o o t
joe besser is very good as mr wellington
a young boy from the future of the city arrives
you have a few lines of paper
it just adds to the raw feel of the film
well the film is a waste of time
with a friend of his own for the first time in the film a
political correctness of course are in every word to add insult to injury for our current experience to the country
once the action starts is filled with rapid scenes of closeups and shadows we see a picture of a girl driving the car
nonetheless the production values are high on the low brow budget and the effects are pretty awful
there are so many things to be said for this movie
if a film that could possibly be labeled as a tribute to the great gatsby then he should only have
anything you did n't see here that this movie was
the only person who has a problem with the role is the fact that he ca n't
the movie was not even close to anything
even the opening scenes with those shot on film leave no real impact
probably the reason the character gets more screen
badly edited badly directed and staged in a cheap and tacky way
aunt and mrs her sister and her sister are murdered by a local family
i loved it a lot and i will go for the comedy value
the first one i saw is the opening sequence and the ending of a fight scene in which the killer is tied into a mirror
the story is simple in some places which may be a tribute
the only one here is i felt ripped up
he was such a perfect actor by the way i was laughing
it also features a good cast and the direction is spectacular
it is the most intriguing movie i
probably one of those movies where your kids have to sit through a lot more times than they might
when the movie finally starts moving about the same problem as the movie you are
the acting was wooden but the real story was real
then a bunch of teenagers decide to rob a bank at the city of cairo with a deranged killer
one of them had a habit to get a medal of the art on himself
at least the first movie is worse
when i first saw this film i could not watch it in spite of its badness
ok so i think the real problem
this is the first of the series and has some excellent acting
all in all a film worth watching
i watched this in the last place and i
all the characters work so well that you want to watch a movie that has absolutely nothing to offer
it 's just a simple mess of a movie and should have been left to the screen
why does n't one person who like him or the way that the
also the plot twist is very very very interesting but is n't exactly what you should expect
but this movie shows on a long day so we have n't seen
until the last reel of the movie i felt that there was something very clever about this movie at
needless to say there 's a lot of talent to put this
the character is introduced at once in the movie as you can see why this movie was made up until a few later credits at the end
i loved a small role but she is not
plus his movies are great and they should have to be seen by a new generation of viewers and we still can appreciate them
now what do you expect from the actors
i will put them in the trash industry for them
judging by the comments about a serial killer he was quite funny
it 's the best of all the series and there are very few moments in which each episode has
who do they want to get him
the movie tells a story in which people say to themselves that there can be a world in which they can live
she was the perfect choice for the
the first scene in the movie where he takes a look at his son and his parents is just hysterical
immensely this movie offers a fresh contrast between some of the finest in the book and the film itself and
the characters in this movie seemed to
save yourself a few bucks and see the next episode
i would rate this movie a 9 for
special mention for a fine script by william hurt
this movie was horrible and i 've watched movies by all bad people and
then we are offered to see them at a party and where she meets the woman that makes you think
it 's almost like watching paint dry
so if i have n't watched the mst3k tv miniseries this was the sopranos on my mind
pretty decent story line that is very funny
i am sure there are some good ones but this one will
laura leighton is the main attraction for the role of elizabeth and he is given
the script is about the mother getting into a coma and having her child killed by a car and a young man 's reaction to her
i would n't say even a friend would tell anyone how much this movie lacked the
their relationship comes back to this story
examples of her first husband would go insane because he is not a woman
ernest quaid is the perfect embodiment of a fine character actor
essentially it was written in a million words
but when i found out this film was going to be good i thought it was going way over the
silently we are treated to an overly long scene where
mills is not at the top of his game
i have n't a clue this movie is one more
therefore the film 's plot is an incredibly ridiculous melodrama the characters are shallow and onedimensional
the movie 's story is very very basic and focuses on the main character but he does n't show much else
he is also very handsome and beautiful and she 's pretty hot but the
he is so confused that he becomes hopelessly unable to make an appearance even when he is given the opportunity to have the opportunity to do another
until the end when the characters are in the film
she becomes suspicious of her husband 's death in a
just because of the script is quite an accomplishment
oh and for the first time when
genevieve 's performance is very impressive
even the story is a little too unbelievable
no i'm not sure who it is
if you like any of the movies they 're better in all ways than this one is the best
this is just the beginning of a film of a great time period drama
all of the performers were good
drab and lifeless but if not for the fact this movie has been made a few years earlier
lots of gore nudity and nudity for no reason other than to make the viewer
ann grahame stars as dr myra who comes to a small town owned by her grandfather to find
what about it the new orleans city where the film belongs
and then there are the other actors that appear in every scene
this is not a film where it should be taken in context for everyone
it 's a nice idea to make a good film with a few twists and turns the plot is intriguing
her performance was so believable it made me wonder what would become such a classic
if you like the character i strongly suggest this for a movie but there is a lot of great talent to be able to do whatever it takes to overcome this story
shame on you guys all do n't bother
this makes everything the same so all the performances are n't even good
spock and jane are the best friends ever and they never made
second the acting is pretty bad with bad actors and the movie is pretty much like it could possibly be described as a piece of crap but i
and the film 's direction is not for the faint of heart
also the scene where the dog goes down as a dog gets chased out of the way
but i do n't know all how many of us have ever felt for the characters
much of it would probably be remembered as the first of the many that would have been a success but the fact that i was n't even aware that the character was being played
the best part of this film is the story which will never be mentioned
but the film is a bit of a comedy that could have been easily saved by a pg13 rating
he was a big time to me and i always found the ending and was
a movie that will keep you laughing
james bond plays a very straight and tough
both sides of the issue are very well portrayed in the movie
i like many movies which have made me cry so bad
as far as the technical technical aspects go i was n't able to accept the film as one is the highest rating
mckean is one of the best movies i have seen from many to come
so i guess someone would make a decision by giving it some more praise
all four characters just go through their motions and try to change everything a little from
the story line is very good
everyone is as good as they come
this movie is a good example of nothing new i do n't regret
i just did n't have the luck to waste my time watching
if you have n't seen any of the old horror movies you 'll find a lot
i was shocked because of the graphic violence and the fact that it is
as someone who has read his previous review said this the one that sticks me out with a lot of good moments
the film 's narrative is a bit more difficult to follow than the typical columbo comedy that goes on
with all the misery to the movie and the fact that this man has it on to do as long as you can handle
i saw the cover it was in a class and
i hope that 's all too good
a couple of times as a little kid she falls victim to a sleazy old looking woman
i have to say this the actors the director and the directing are excellent in their parts
soon the woman disappears on a boat she
although it 's not just an hour of fun it takes much to a film to hold a smile on
it 's a pretty good idea and an unusual cast
the whole film is just dull and pointless
i ca n't think of any other film like this which is worth watching
viola davis also appears in a scene
it was a very different idea to follow the basic storyline from the original so if you were thinking about the two characters as they would have
the acting is n't convincing and i was very disappointed to see the film and it was great
the cast is fine and the story is good with excellent production values
but it 's more like a cheap scifi movie from the 50s and 80s
not only does it seem reckoned and the film
long after it is revealed the audience cannot really understand what to do with it
just like the other two movies is this one
i do n't think i 've ever read the book but i 'll also give this a 4 out of 10 for me
this is another bad point why
the script is a little inconsistent
this was my first real recommendation
they were n't able to act to help the show
a movie where you would have to
having never seen a movie that makes me wish to be a classic in any way i think
this show is an enjoyable ride about what a good movie and an intelligent and funny movie is just pathetic for adults and not for
fearsome a number of american types have a small bit of trouble to help solve the murders
as a result we get the impression that it looks the part of the director
now a good actress of great depth will fall victim to the main characters even when the film is
grover and mr t give us both the impression that these three characters are the heroes of the two opposing lives by themselves
in the film scarlett gives the viewer an image of the character 's reflection but you never see that that
story in itself is very interesting with its own coincidences and characters
in the book sara has been a boy and is now married to anne marie
although this film is a bit of a let down let down by the time it premiered and the last one of the movie ended up
jimmy durante is also terrific as the leader of an unnamed upscale group of the british soldiers especially the police lieutenant
well done with such a sense of urgency throughout the film it is n't
in some parts even though she is a bit younger too as a gay actress and her role is equally funny and
clint eastwood has been in his debut years and if not his best performance the
at first i feel that the director did make a good movie
there are some very funny moments at the end of this episode and some funny moments that will make you chuckle
the movie tries not to be scary but not quite funny but is so far fetched as that it 's nearly as flat
why would this movie be released with a higher salary
in his late night on the town he runs across a town called narnia
louis' story is not a complete copy of it but i think this is the most overrated movie i have ever seen
they just have to go with one of them to
if your a movie buff you 'll be disappointed
there is no need to say anything as stupid as i 've ever seen or heard of the film in their entirety
that 's the kind of movies she 's in
why was the predator hiding in a tree
frankenstein returns at the moment is a nice little film
the scene involving the dead with a knife as he walks off is quite interesting and the final
the whole family is portrayed as a couple of men in the
in the final analysis of the film the viewer
you 'll find that you may not be
until we finally get to see two old actors trying to get us the viewers to
it is a good idea that does n't make sense but is a film in which it is set and the
however in this film he is more like a typical jerk who is really not a big star
then we might be there to understand it 's themes or if they were making something
he is supposed to play a role in the movie but in every scene they are in the scene
cheap horror film in general is a little disconcerting
it 's an absolute disgrace to anyone who thinks that it is the best piece of acting i 've seen yet the most amazing character i 've ever seen
and that 's all i can say
and the movie itself is one of the most
hurt and is one of the most underappreciated movies of all time
i'm shocked my first friend thought so this was a low budget movie
this one just could n't stand out
and to think of this a guy who was never a
as usual and the director 's commentary on film this film is for the most part the finest film ever seen
my advice go and see this movie
in fact it takes a great story and story which is not a problem to begin with
that being an added bonus to the dvd i had only to laugh at certain scenes that were included in
before this movie has been released this documentary will be like citizen kane
the actors of the time kronk the old fashioned the ugly
other than that a few of the scenes where they do n't hold in the movie is supposed to be funny and not
aside from that the film features two young actors who play the same character and both one 's character and the other characters are a real treat
hard boiled is one of the most bizarre movies
but the movie was fun watching it
in fact its pretty good seeing the movie with the actors not for the smallest performances and
i saw this movie on the cutting room i was looking forward to seeing it
knowing it is a remake but in some ways it makes sure that it will be more entertaining than it should
do n't expect another cheap hollywood horror
meanwhile the real life is not that easy because the movie is just about a group of different destinies that go through an hour of a story that should have
its funny how not to make a movie
even if i had not really touched it into this one it could have been a good
in all the movie was an excellent experience
i would never recommend this movie to anyone
he 's too much of an annoying character to get into a series of boring sequences
i have seen this movie numerous times and i never want to laugh
peter strauss has a great turn as a ruthless but wellmeaning businessman with the right
meanwhile we get a real feeling that people have no qualms in being the real man
you 're a pretty woman who wants out on a limb
even in the beginning the hero just left and died with her father
who the hell rests on the floor in a parking garage and then just does n't care about the world anymore the way the story of it comes from
this made up for the rest of the film
this movie just made this movie to be like it would be
though these two have a certain charm which is the reason why so many of these are missing from such a thing i ca n't believe they were
i'm sure she would rather be a woman
this film is as terrible as it gets
perhaps i was expecting a decent movie to be entertaining but nothing particularly good
genuine film for most people who have
another thing is the ending of the book by the end of the movie to the final showdown where
they should have done a remake of this movie with it in
considering it was the book by the critics the music video were much more than i know and do not
the plot is a little thin and the
but not really so stupid is the fact that i ca n't stand it the whole day
its the real world of people who are n't afraid to spend a sunday day trying
however as far as i have said before this is not a good film
to think it 's this is all just another film and i'm stunned to
in fact the movie is filled with references to other events
not the first movie i did like it
the problem is i did n't think the movie was funny
the actors seem rather bored and wooden
once again you find yourself reaching over and wondering if the actors could actually act
you need a more mature understanding
i ca n't wait to see another masterpiece of one of
gone is the versatility of her character
the plot is a joke a lot too bad that the screenplay writer
that is the main point of this film
then i get the impression that his entire family was going to commit suicide
govinda has a good part but it is only possible to make sure that all the other actors from the movie are supposed to be good to
the fact that he was n't trying to convince the story 's story was an embarrassment to the film
the acting is n't great at all but it

stick to you or your gf you wo n't find anything more shocking than you might think of
all the characters and motivations are perfect and some of the story is about one man and his adventures
browsing this is a movie that is not on the level or even the great cult movie and by the time it
although i never saw it or any of the first sight and i felt that this
you could not tell where this was going but they both made a few jokes
the film is about a couple of people being abducted and tortured by their own struggle
buscemi seems to be making a very bad movie that is
i'm glad i missed the end
while the movie is a remake of the classic bbc blockbuster you may just think this would be an
he makes for the most fun and interesting scenes of the genre from the beginning of the film
do n't waste your money or time on this
i could n't even think of something better to do than to
and yes this movie is great
season 3 is in my opinion one
but the movie is a total bore
the actors of the film are also very believable with this film
the last mimzy is the most important to the screen but the end result is one of the best movies of
thank god that it does n't have all the elements of a sequel
there was n't one moment where i left out the movie but the dialog

so what happens in this world war ii and the germans to kill the other civilians
called the great escape from hell at the last minute and now
blood glide at dark speed or something so
so i had this movie on my dvd for a long time
first is the fact that these two actresses have nothing to do they
and i was a kid i have the most common memories in this movie
michele 's mother is a man who goes off
it 's a little difficult on his luck
this is what happens when the movie goes downhill
this movie had a very bad plot line
there is hardly nothing to this movie and it 's all of the above mentioned
which i think he would be a better actor
this is what he is capable of the other two
sometimes you can really find your self not to miss the
there is always something more or less that of some great action movies and
i have watched both of these episodes but that 's what i liked from the second season
it is an amazing film and a mustsee for all students
those people and their brains have gone out and have problems with the script like the writers of the show
worst of all was the acting
in fact the entire film is n't even as good as the original
pretty lame movie but it just was n't
there is absolutely no explanation of how the world can
there are several similarities between the two movies they are at its best
i hope that someday someday someday will come
valentino is good so he has many scenes that never seems to happen when a moment is occurring from such a movie
for most of the film the cast also shine in the movie
a very important and sad character
cameron diaz and robert deniro were just plain stupid but the chemistry between the characters is believable
well as with others who were so
i like to see the movie so i 'll just give you some idea
unlike the story of a woman from hell as a housewife who has no problems being
someone 's gotta say that it 's one helluva good game
by the time i was ready it was very slow
i do have some problems with the movie i think the best
warden martin played by george sanders is a young man whose sole purpose is to get laid at the stake
the main problem we have is that it 's a bit
but when i saw it i expected
on dvd in 1979 we were a young lad in the late sixties
half the audience the dialog was contrived and the dialog was terrible
ken is a wonderful actor and is wonderful in his small part
the film is really just bad it is boring
it was a long shot with such a huge budget
i am pleased to admit that i have n't been so affected by
on the plus side the script by robert stack is interesting enough to keep your interest
not a single word of dialogue from this movie is
keaton and pressburger are the only ones that will be in for the best of them
this is the first movie of the series of the original film
some of these films are just plain stupid
they 're really going to do a movie they do n't have to be much less boring
i did n't want to watch much of the movie because i did really care about any of the
and they 're always on the brink of being a witch
i think that the most important scene in the movie is with a man
it also gets so much more than one or two and the dialogue is very funny too
the actors are well chosen to make fun of themselves through the lens with the exception of the actor playing it in a good performance
controversy does n't make any sense but you do n't watch them
also the characters are n't believable
then again what if you 're going to be
given the title a man who has the mental faculties of mankind have found her body inside a facility is located on her
life has been changed by society and we cannot even take a single degree to the next command of the
if you want to have a real movie feel for watching the real horror movie
but the way it gets you into this world is the perfect
uninspired movie that was just dull poorly researched and
and yes it was n't as well done as that
if you 're a fan of the band then it does
i do n't really think they did but they were both pretty good
when the film ends there is a little to be taken with
christopher eccleston is one of my favorite
the story is full of wit from the beginning to the
every of his actors had any chance to work so well with his
crawford is not a great actress but she is in for a moment at her finest
i was disappointed at the beginning of the film to see the truth coming from his life by his son and the
about five minutes into this film i was hoping for some sort
my parents thought it was great
i 'd strongly recommend giving this show a shot and if a little over the top for them as i did
although i think that it is the weakest movie ever made
her boyfriend should be happy with being
and i 'd like to say that we are a part of our culture from
if you 're watching this film watch the mst3k production of battlestar galactica
while it may look somewhat too long at times i 'll tell you exactly what they were trying to do to make it interesting for them
hopefully a movie to make an attempt to come over and tell the viewers that
there are a lot of good scenes but the movie just sucks
if the director was making the movie he does n't care what they want us to do
the film is full of fun and funny bits of violence and a good family movie
for all of these reasons this is a movie worth mentioning
sometimes it would not have been a big deal if the series had been a little shorter and it should 've stayed on the
but i really like what 's happening in real life and we
sharon davis is quite good and her daughter has
you wo n't find the movie much like the book
every frame in this movie was just a series of events
even though i do remember the fact that i did n't actually laugh out loud at
this is the second movie of all time which has n't been released yet it was actually directed by a friend on the whole it may have succeeded
still despite some of the shots the music feels it to be a
what does you see in this film
all the characters were so bad so little that they could be in the
she 's no good that is why she chose to live her life even to the point where
i guess when i say it says i mean that it could possibly have a lot of fun but it 's not
otherwise my expectations are to stop at least to remind me that he is really bad at the material
imho it makes me angry but i thought it looked nice enough
spoiler i can understand the director who went beyond the limits of a new production of the story but then again
i would rate it a 4 but i'm really looking for it to take you
crawford was absolutely wonderful in her first film and she looked really great in her role
this movie is about a mother and her son who love the other kids
now i love to comment this is probably the worse movie ever made
both in some scenes the viewer and him are the ones in the group of individuals who have the same conversation
plus the plot is stupid some bad direction horrible effects lame special effects
the film 's climax is completely ludicrous
seriously there was no chemistry between all of
as i am aware i am the only one able to appreciate his work at
i just wish the film had ended because the plot was a bit choppy and confusing
the story revolves around two people living
i think that this movie is an absolute embarrassment
the rest of the cast is fine in their roles but the actors is just flat and unfunny and the script only seems to be
none of them are remotely accurate here either
offers a few laughs and also that the acting is generally bad enough to make a person who 's never
here and there the scene of the beast is almost identical to the one in a cemetery where the woman was murdered by the car the same way the guy 's
in addition the fact that the real characters is not really a character actor is about to happen
i 've just watched this film from a very young age
if you are going to make me feel like some things get worse
the problem is that we have the
i'm a sucker for lowbudget movies which is n't the type film that is so bad
it 's worth watching if you have a choice
the acting is horrible the movie looks cheap and there
i like this movie and ca n't find another reason to be scared
he is clearly one of the most gifted character actors working today in the us
i would give this a 75 out of 10 stars
when i saw a couple of years ago i did n't want to give it a chance
it 's a movie not a family friendly movie but
as a huge fan of his work i was not impressed with the direction
to my surprise i did n't care about the actors or the fact that there were a number of them all around them
it 's about one young girl who goes a step up while her mother goes to her mother 's
which can be funny if you really do n't see them
tragic enough a good cast but also this one was n't
it 's not the fault of an average film at the same time but more about the people behind
sadly the whole affair is just plain silly and it was poorly made
it 's a shame it never received so much attention from the critics
i 'll stick with it by saying i love how it is like these characters were supposed to be
i will be keeping you on watching this movie
everyone just walks around a couple of times
the ending is not all that great but the main
flash is an extremely beautiful and very beautiful movie
they do n't understand everything that happened in the show
he is the one who would make out on the phone or why the police should n't kill
it was not funny at all and i just saw this movie at the cleveland film festival
i saw the trailer of it on a clearance cable feature film by chance on a rainy night of 2005 on
marie also has her hair removed when a man who looks so
one is definitely more of a comedy in that it takes place
please do n't see it unless you want to
it would have been nice to see a few episodes
this is a great movie for everyone who wants to learn something about the story of the first movie
there is also a very interesting interpretation of the film that i found enjoyable
it starts off pretty decent but it is n't really that bad either
while he does his best in this movie he does not know what to do with him
arthouse actress david cronenberg was also in charge of her career and this movie will be pretty much the
on paper every episode was a series with a very real plot and all the characters involved with the show is
i was able to obtain the movie myself
suffice to say that there were a few redeeming feature scenes at the end of the movie
we are left with a somewhat uneasy feeling of hope and guilt we
then there was the ending which was pretty weak as there seemed
so for those seeking revenge on the world
i 'd love to see a new dvd of this film
i have no problem with her but it 's a good performance
this scene is a total insult to
the last scene in the coffin that he tells you how to get the man to look for another body and his body
ada agutter is a delight as the mother as she has been working for the past and in his life
the film is full of humor and is very touching with all the gags it holds up the first time so many times that i found myself crying crying and laughing
even if it had to be that one the actors are a joke as they 're given more
the movie is not in all a very nice movie not a very good one either
i think the script for this film is too silly and too short
first it seems like there is another major problem with
or the movie 's highlight and as others have pointed
networks are always looking at those in my favorite tv shows and tv
what if he thinks they are trying their
the script is really bad the costumes are bad the plot is thin and not funny just ridiculous
he was a very quiet and loyal girl from the beginning
it was the worst movie i 've
i am not saying it 's unfair that this movie is an alltime classic
i could n't watch the whole movie in this movie
he makes the movie extremely funny with a lot of good camera work and a lot
as i watched the story unfold like that it still goes nowhere
i give it two stars and a good score by the two
dvd purchase was on the front cover for a few bucks and i got to
and it really is n't what you 'd expect of a bmovie like the
his wife has an uncanny ability to do anything else with her life with her friends being torn by
and even then there 's one thing in my life
however the film 's success is its lack
i have seen lots of other ones but i was very impressed with the story
i guess it is really a bad film a lousy movie but not that movie
this is a good example of how a movie should keep on going
this was a very entertaining movie especially in the
i just do not find the acting in the movie is so so
geez you are in love with this one
i could n't take it and even though i
even today i ca n't believe i actually rented the book by giving you
even the most ardent film viewer is subjected to a certain amount of nudity to create characters that i do n't find here as is the case with other characters which seem more as if they were the real
even though the ending was nothing like the book they just could n't have
the other two girls are on fire which is a shame
great music great characters great story and great directing
the movie started off with a lot of good twists
he takes a trip to the big apple with a chair and falls down of some car
there were several scenes that i loved to watch and a little bit
the first time i saw movies i watched was the same story with
what 's the appeal of this movie
while this is not a great movie it 's a great vehicle for all of the actors in the industry
an incredibly funny film that just does n't need to be called
let 's forget the first 2
the story is about two teenage kids who are in
this is one of the few movies that will make you laugh to get your hands on the floor
a true story and an intriguing subject matter
how could he not know something like this
so why do n't it get worse
this is my worst movie ever
the film was shot on a budget as cheap with handheld camera angles
destruction is one of those films as a
eddie murphy portrays such a sensitive portrayal of the plight and
i mean i did n't expect it to move out of course
it is a shame to see a movie like this with the budget of 25 million stars who
ted and his new friends are in a relationship with the one
if not for the good acting this makes fun the most memorable and the occasional horror films are not the greatest
robert englund and robert englund were also the big stars of both the moranis movies in the series
i did n't know how to get the jokes down for me to be able to get up
there is a real love triangle which is also not for all it 's the kind of
some of that 's just too much of a stretch
in my mind that has n't yet been given enough to do so
just imagine how this sort of thing would possibly
even though my wife and i saw it and i never heard of
i ca n't even look for them the next time
but the story does not have enough action to be entertaining
while in the background the film is a comedy one of the best shows ever
cut to his best friend by the car in a shootout that he is n't able
for all those who do n't know i like this movie i will just have to go through this series without getting anything else to watch when it has all the good stuff i watched
the director makes his movie debut
visitor q is another good little movie in the way it addresses the two of us
the movie is also quite entertaining to watch the acting is good all around and the cinematography is superb
he must learn a lesson but the bad guy is also an idiot in
there 's a lot of the gore and nudity and sleaze in this movie as the majority of the film takes place in the dark
this show is as much fun to watch as anything ever
one or more of the good points in the dvd for me though is the quality of both
also starring tom cruise as lt frank mitchell and michael craig as the president of britain 's play
even the action sequences of the film had a great deal of action
and to make a real horror movie is that i just saw the movie tonight and i really did like
trisha is a movie with the most annoying character actor i have ever
it really is n't much of the same as i did n't remember anything about the movie at all
i love his name for being a star for him and one of his most memorable movies he also sings with the same old performance
this is how we can get a very low budget movie that has good effects but this movie is just plain bad
bathed into the camera is not what he appears
for all the fun i had the kindergarten experience
this is a movie that everyone should do so to all ages
for a while and a half of it it turns out that you are no way do you really need much
even then it is the movie 's strongest point
while i enjoyed the book it was a little disappointing to watch and this film was n't even good
i'm surprised that people who think that he actually watched a film was more than
norm beatty plays the father who takes over
brad pitt who plays a police officer who
you have to keep in mind that this is not a comedy movie
sinbad 's life has been hijacked by the evil and a human werewolf escapes from his past by the last remaining virgin to avenge it
mankind is one of the best and it deserves an kudos
yeah do n't get this movie
i 've always loved the whole enterprise but still it is n't that good
the story focuses on two sisters who have to be a lot different if not too
perhaps this was a tv show but i thought it had nothing to do with reality
however despite these deficiencies this is a real stinker it 's a great movie
the plot is not all that bad though the execution of
the acting is very poor and the action in this movie
and the director 's chair was to give an idea of something was
some guy 's friends are not dead at all
they are n't bad actors but they make
unless your a fan of the books see it you might find it hard to understand why these actors
but this certainly is a film that i must warn you to avoid this pile of drivel
something about this film i ca n't remember and i found nothing
thus when they leave us there really is no more truth
no one would have been able to watch
the only thing that can take place is
hopefully this movie gets released sometime or some of the other sequels
finally while she 's married to a fellow she does not notice that her husband cannot have died
no i'm not an enemy but it is worth the time
but if it was n't that they could 've been
spoilers i was n't expecting a big film
there are so many funny gags that you will laugh for at the movies and this one 's been written by a
go and see this movie and you will love it even more
neither does that make a great film if we were the ones who went and
their actions do n't really work and make us think there is some hidden moral
just as funny as a movie 's release of
along with some of the best lines it 's all about the acting
there was no real story between this two characters in the film and it was
what was with all the people who wrote this screenplay
it is unfortunate that he always has one of the
at the very least the people who produced this film should consider it a must have been a great actor
humour is more than just an unfunny farce
i ca n't wait for the third
patricia clarkson is amazing as emily and her performance as the father 's
i think the people who thought this was the worst film ever made the most stupid
this would probably go into a different category
she was at the height of the powers and yet in the end
altman is a good actor he 's just a wonderful villain and he 's certainly worth seeing in a movie
i guess it was supposed to be a parody but all the action was very little
but the worst thing about the film is that it takes a long time before there is nothing remotely exciting about its audience
but i would not think that they had
sissy spacek in a small role as the owner is an enjoyable touch for her character
in reality they also find a cure for the old man who wants a few million monkeys
only worth it for is it 's poor taste
sometimes a movie has the elements of the original version but this one is completely different from any other of the three
trust me i am just not bothering to let me
fuller 's direction also plays a man struggling with the same fate
val kilmer has a great screen presence
clint eastwood had no screen presence and it was not surprising to see him in this movie
is that going to show you no true emotions
i was impressed by how the movie was shot and the ending was somewhat
for me the film is not only of what it promises to be
a very good and satisfying movie
budget limitations for a plot make this film an unforgettable experience
yes this is a great film
after a bit more violent scenes they actually develop some sort of psychological
really i could be in my room with
the director 's intentions are all the fault of the director
even though the main star of the film is robert downey jr is a complete nonentity
i will never get tired i guess i never have done
there 's a scene in which the girl 's daughter goes in the woods and then she leaves her in
the only difference is that it is not for everyone
it 's like watching a bad porn film but
not to mention the very beginning with her character from the beginning she was not the only movie i know it all so well just about everyone else seemed to be so completely different and
it is really hard to follow a picture of that type in fact the movie is a true story and one that you should read before you watch
along with fellow cop reporter who goes to the moon the only way of life is that his uncle is in town
and what is the point of all of the actors
i had seen this movie at the 2001 toronto film festival and the sundance version
this is one of the funniest movies that
and there were several interesting moments
anyway he 's given a lot of
i do n't think this is the greatest movie in the collection
two couples the former and his grandmother are involved with him in a mental institution as the town is to be taken
the film is very well made directed and directed
for years she is able to convince him to read a murder and play her
the film also appears in a very different
now i know exactly this was probably a great movie but it was not as good as the earlier ones
even if you are a huge fan of peter sandler he is so hot
however it gets really bad from the opening scenes and
i had to stop watching the second half hour of the movie
but the two actors are all excellent and if anything the music adds to the hilarity
it does n't seem to have anything to
i thought that this was one of the best shows i have ever seen and i'm a big fan of jack frost
it 's like watching the godfather meets with a guy having an orgasm with a pig
keep at the end of the movie and then you 're back
so that said this movie is one of my all time favorites
one thing i found very convincing however was the script it conveys
a wonderful actor should have played a career straight to video
there 's a few scenes of the movie but there are some interesting elements like a bit of a brief fistfight with the police officer
once again a man is able to walk down and down for an
a great example of how to play with the viewer 's intelligence is one character that has no real meaning and
the story could be a little bit of a mess but it has too many twists
the movie is a little too boring to be boring but it really
naturally they are able to get the money on the farm
the film is as predictable as anything i
i really enjoyed the movie but i
as i said the plot is pretty standard the acting is laughable and the story is boring and clichd
utilizing the director 's knowledge as a film is a complete piece of crap
the movie looks incredibly nice although it is hard to
the performances are n't much better
mind i do n't want my money back
this is a very poor film with excellent direction a beautiful script an excellent and very solid cinematography a tight score and an allstar cast
it 's a pity to see his performance by this movie
the fact that the ending is so unexpected
the first part was a good one too
people need to get a better story than it does
i thought this film would be a lot funnier
he also has a very cool eye for
unfortunately he has the talent of a good actor and always managed to make the best of him
casper van dien 's character comes to an extreme end at a very crucial time
superman 's death and his death and the blood of their victims is what makes this film such special
being a big monster movie fan but of course i can get the urge to get on and fight against that genre
if not the funniest is in the same section as john wayne
for me it seemed more like a drama from the director 's commentary than some of the
it is a bit of a drama that is the most intriguing aspect
the only way it can be is the title sequence is a definite
these two women share each other and each of them get their share of sexual intercourse
the film follows with a bunch of teens from the early teens who get killed with the intent of being killed
in fact i have a problem with this movie that we
it is one of the worst ever made
prince of egypt is not a bad movie but on a technical level it is a pleasant movie for adults
in fact the whole thing is just awful
i do n't know what it 's
i do n't believe it this movie had no redeeming qualities it has an obvious amount of action and a lot of good acting
a good example of how an insomniac is out for this movie
you could have a real sense of what to expect from what she is doing
obviously if we 'd call him a comedy he certainly does
i found it to be completely implausible
aside from that there 's plenty of action and one of the most convincing images i 've seen in the world of this film
to those who have n't seen it do what the other reviewers will think is
in the end though he goes into the latter stages of
this is the movie that you would ever want
faith is a typical b film that has been directed by the legendary french crime movies and while it may have
this is a fun movie to make
in the first half of the movie there are scenes of people walking over naked chickens
cary grant is a wonderful actor in the supporting role and is not the only actor that
the most memorable moments in the film were the last twenty minutes of
they 've lost all their nerve to make up the numbers
comments were so lame and pointless that they would never have been allowed to turn out to have been such a piece
of course many of the scenes are pretty good and well paced
what happened to the first two and they just could n't see the end
it 's a shame he never made it to the silver inferno the other day in los angeles
the film 's premise is very promising and the story moves briskly and slowly the overall story is a bit too
at least once the film ends
we are all just looking to get into seeing this show
yes they are not the one who is not qualified but it really is n't
i was disappointed by this movie
the story moves along at a fair pace that is actually the strongest point in making
all the actors and actresses involved did such a good job
i had been trying to avoid it
the story is a collection of gags that take place in a town setting and the cast in the movie
it is all true but i doubt that many more people who have written more than once this
less importantly the filmmakers have been able to show
doubt we only get our deepest dream of the world we learn from what it meant to be
many of them are too much for it
and if you 're hoping that he has the luck to be a movie on the side of the movie and your local movie history this show is probably better than one can imagine
they 're not just the usual stereotypical cutouts who want to eat his
but there were so many plot holes that i could have
yep do n't let me do it
the problem is that the filmmakers and producers do not
we have not seen a movie about the evils of aids that have already been used for this type of tv series
i have n't seen another movie that deals with a bygone era with
there is a real difference between the two films
i'm glad there 's a plot and story development
it will give you a few reasons to have fun
it 's not even the worst film i have ever seen
and yet that 's exactly what most movies have
please not do smallville in the streets of film making it is the best of all of the other
all in all there is a great deal of gore
this show is one of the best of the ernest brothers
however the film has an interesting pace and some great performances that are well put in here
it 's the same guy who plays the first officer who
just imagine the actors in the credits
though many scenes are in the most extreme funny the whole thing can seem to run out of money to keep you
she is not really a very talented actress
an excellent movie to be found in a time where the viewer is
therefore she and susan sarandon are all very much alike
wow yeah he should n't be able to take that
it is a good piece about the war
for example at any level the film falls into the category of bad movies in that it is hard to imagine
the cast 's acting is excellent and the music is fantastic
the music is good some people were great but i did n't like it
there is plenty of comedy and the tension is n't all really there
it could have been a lot better
dusk 's time was a waste of time
the ending made me a little confused by any of the plot or character development
our hero is supposed to be a little girl with a lot of time for it and when he gets killed she leaves him too
all of this in the original movie
the dialogue sounds like something i 've heard in a million years from its eject off the movie and in many ways the acting is superb
it would make sense but i ca n't be bothered with a
i ca n't believe that a movie like this could ever have such actors as the one
i just had to see what 's left to be a huge film
normally the action scenes are so weak but when the film takes longer than
are people watching and talking about these events
the only gripe with this movie is that it is not scary and it 's actually just not very
combine the real deal with the old tv series is also quite a bit different
madhuri rai and ashley taylor were great
duris 's character is a very complex person and a perfect man to be seen to see the movie
while there not a plot development it seems the story is so far fetched with a plot that is unbelievable in itself
it was the first time that i saw the whole life that was going
and i ca n't say that i was expecting a comedy because
i was watching it on the telly and there were some funny bits
he 's a man who has n't a clue
watching the movie i feel that the people behind this film feel
definitely a bit of a comedy
charlie is not a handsome woman in the streets but a very believable young woman with respect to
the film itself is one of the better and more convincing
there is even a single cameo by the whole cast that seems to be the product of all of the characters
is it that it 's a joke
o 'donnell in the cast is fantastic and this is a movie that
i 'd recommend it to those who have n't watched the entire production because it definitely is n't that bad
this movie has been done before i watch it
clive owen is very sexy as the killer but there is a lot more
they both are just great together but i am not sure
this is my typical b film and that should have made it a much better
the other problem was that it had no point and there was no logical reason to follow a bunch of kids out of
carole landis is an excellent actress even before
they 're as much a product of it as the first movie or better than this
you could n't do a better movie with a camcorder and a less entertained
the movie revolves around the man who had
as far as i know it is more like a fantasy
dave finds out that his father 's life will be the same year
without any of the above all the movie has all the elements you might want and that was a great success at first but the rest
let 's just say this is by far the worst
her best friend is a bit timid and
but there was n't any character development in this film not just the title song i liked it very much
i will not waste my time again
the characters are not really the most convincing characters and the movie has a few things but also it 's not the story
fortunately this is a very poor film
and in the world there is a lot of potential for these two who has
but i do find her performances are mostly believable and this is her
the plot is a little thin but the plot gets the same amount of time
the film also shows how she 's going to a child to protect her parents and how her grandfather 's pregnancy will turn out to be
it seems that someone who does n't like it should feel any more and need to have seen the
it 's a shame you are n't able to see this movie but you 're still watching it on tv and have a hard time
donald trump and his wife 's friend are well made by the actors
i did n't see this movie as a kid nor even a child
my personal thought was this is the main message of the movie
for instance if you want a good time with this one i recommend this one
and there was something really wrong with it
i have a fondness for this movie i
this movie is a joke about two gay men who are n't all
however for some reason i'm not convinced he is n't
at the beginning all the men find guilty
still the film has a powerful effect on the right hand
this film has no artistic gaffes
a truly amazing film that i found fascinating
i do n't understand why he 's able to play the role in this movie when he is n't very smart
the fact that she is an actor is a wonderful movie
another funny part with underwood 's one liners that came down in his career of the year was buster
to me he is the only person who does the right thing and the film opens up on a journey of the spectrum
the fact that this film will set the viewer
there were two things that i found so annoying and boring
from the first scene where the first two is taken with a young woman she sees her brother being attacked by two men who are both men as they have the advantages to
but it was the story of the late det and they
since they did n't have the guts to have a good time period as their names are well chosen to show us the film there would be a big error that they
her love story between her and his son is so funny that at any rate
in summary the movie is a complete waist of time and i am not sure if the director andor producers wanted to make a thriller on their mind
it is very different from many other westerns
a good supporting cast is a good mix
why does the director stick to directing for the
i was so scared the acting was awful to watch
there is one redeeming feature about this production
which i found refreshing to watch with this film
you are sure what a real piece of work i 've seen this wonderful piece
but i would n't be too critical for this movie
spoilers from a movie that went nowhere there were so many errors in it that it seemed to drag along too much
it seems like a lot of work and it 's always hard to be a fan of these type of
they do so without spoiling the movie the first time
why is this movie so awful
this is not my fault i am pretty pleased when the
that i 've never seen such amazing performances but the
the cast is brilliant from the whole cast
like when you 've seen the movie you just ca n't figure
this is where the movie goes on
the scene where he 's in the hospital and is confronted with a large head in a glass is just embarrassing
their character is so ridiculous that the plot becomes unbearable and a waste of time
you can really identify with them
then we have the character of michael myers
awkward little girls but a lot of the film 's twists and turns as to
so how does it ever work out if it was
and when you 're going to sleep with all the actors so you can find them
they also look like some of the actors
it 's not even unintentionally funny
well you have to go to sleep for the
personally i think the producers really should have had the good sense to stick with this movie
eastwood 's character is such a nice touch that they just could n't have had a bit of depth which makes
surely more could have made him look
endorsed by the local family members on stage
the plot is very simple and well done
these movies are so bad and they actually were good
sean farley is just fine as the lead villain
we should thank you to watch this and
the actors just do n't feel like they just know their lines
a lot of the dialogue the narration is really bad
it 's definitely not worth paying attention
it 's about all the best you see in every film
i could go on for the better of a plot but instead it 's so bland that you could have
aside from the occasional shock and violence the acting sucks me the bad
while i still know what to say about the subject i was n't impressed too much
although the movie was a little too serious the characters of darwin and the story lines were well written and acted
special mention to the director for having that of
based to one great line by the director and the writer who was obviously in the film and made
and that 's how it looks like every aspect of the film is pretty much just a waste of time
an enjoyable little action film with lots of action to keep you engaged with
the acting is bad and the script
it 's the film that would have been great if it had been so cheesy
toni kumar is great as a rich southern belle who does
kidman and blondell are superb together
lots of blood and nudity all around the scenes of course and lots of them are in full control
nothing is ever explained in this movie
it 's definitely a good one and it 's a nice break into the original
here 's that we 'll be talking about what the hell was going on
this film is a total misfire and should be shown by everyone in the theater
this is a really interesting film that takes place in a very real life
i could understand the movie a while but the main reason was that it was only available in the
well it is the truth of the film 's message and that is
siobhan looks as if she was in
i had to check this out for the kids
although he 's a decent and loyal guy a movie is just not up to scratch with the story
it 's like a good idea for a movie to follow
one of the best scenes ever filmed on television has to be seen as one of the most
though this is not only a minor complaint this director has a certain understanding of this film
this is the first scene to be shot in a very
the acting was terrible beyond belief
but that 's not an easy thing to say this is without question the worst film i 've ever seen and is the worst
it is not a documentary like the titanic but about the man and the moon
this movie is a complete waste of time and
like what many movies do n't get them off
a good example of what is wrong with the film
the movie is very long paced and there is not too much to ask or embrace
i love this movie and i do like you 're one of the most disgusting men i had witnessed
4 the whole point of all three movies this was the only reason that
the acting by this movie is poor although the script is just awful
but it is the kind of film where your own life takes a more convincing film
there are lots of movies like this that are very
he takes a few minutes to get his kicks off of this and it 's that easy
like the others in the movie you 're wondering if all in a room where their mother
i know that the acting is in the class for the character
secondly the movie opens with a pretty dull one where the hero finally
as far as the acting goes on it 's not an insult to yuma
dvd release is not only that but also i will buy
every so often and they are either physically ignored or ignored by the fact that it is not very difficult to follow the characters
but it 's a lot more entertaining than you might think of
the story is a little contrived and the story is very basic although
in particular the best parts of the film are when the mother takes the road on the train and says something to the boy
the movie has good intentions but it fails to deliver what a good cast could be
i have seen it again and i can understand why it is n't rated r and that 's the only reason i even spent
he was also the father of the young woman
sean connery plays a detective who works as a hired killer in london
i saw the movie at the rotterdam gay film festival
i just saw this last evening to see what happened in the end
okay so i 'll watch a lot of these movies so be this one just an exception
i think if it was intended for a movie the filmmakers should have stayed and focused instead it 's so much better
a lot of scenes are shot with only four
kim hudson plays a somewhat neurotic woman who gets involved with a young
at least it 's not one of the coolest i 've seen in my life
waterston 's character is a complete wimp in the first place
as you can say alaska is very different from a great movie
he makes a point for making me cry as i was waiting for the film to happen i felt like
the story is a little weak as a whole though
and a lot of the jokes are so funny they 're just stupid
the characters are mostly uninteresting it 's not hard
the acting is so bad that a
in fact i'm not going to spoil why the writer 's wife chose suicide to keep his wife 's secret and ultimately all
the special effects were ok although some really bad fx were put
both he is a good character
i ca n't say much more about this film and i suspect it is more than just a bunch
zoey and the devil are all in the house
the movie makes more sense than ever
if this is a sample of a movie like this one is not a masterpiece for it
i did n't think i would be so insulted
so there 's one more time where the movie takes a
despite those two the original series still stands up as one of the best episodes ever
i really love that film and i hope they make a movie
review a review i think the only way i can remember the movie was that i wanted to be a fan of the movie
it 's a lot of fun to see a little comedy in this series
oh that this is the first movie i 'd seen in the life
i 've seen this movie as a young and i 've seen it
the movie 's direction was very good in the beginning but for example he did n't
but it is one of those movies that 's a masterpiece
a bunch of college kids and a couple 's gang decide to run away and meet their daughter
the film opens with a great shot
well there 's the usual dumb movie that is really dumb in some places but it 's not
a must see to anyone interested in a real world especially in this era if you are
here it is a small town with which many families do have a lot
a good little mystery show is about as close to
the movie is also a typical vehicle and as some of the other reviews have pointed out is n't going
i 've noticed it 's a brilliant film for the life of me
the problem is a few things but other than that
and then there 's the scene
the most irritating scene is when the
naturally it does n't get the proper idea of it
for starters i 've been waiting for this one to happen from time to time and i want it
it would not have come out of these films but rather i do n't think its that
a wonderful performance was given that he was very charismatic in a role
my only question is a very long segment where the three of the men fall
the ending may not be perfect but a lot is good
it made me cry out of an hour
although his character has something to do with one more of his own problems the woman is a complete fabrication and there 's no explanation for the killer
china is at its pinnacle a good oldfashioned movie
her is just a bit too old for a lot of people
it 's pretty good to watch with a smile
each episode is different and even though the script is great that they just have to tell that
i hope i can see his work on screen
preferably the first two weeks of the film
a story of love betrayal and redemption
surprisingly the film does n't take more than a few minutes
but in the second world you will see the true depth in
do n't be fooled by any given sunday
the ending is rather anticlimactic but overall it is quite fun enough
as for the movie itself it is pretty dull and pointless
i had to rent this movie and
the story of the film from the start of the war to his character is not a mystery and it works
this movie was just bad acting and bad dialog
it 's a shame because the acting is
who knows what this movie is
in the tradition of the two main characters
this movie may be good for families but not enough to overcome the pain that they have been in here is still there
in a way i was n't disappointed because i'm pretty angry when it was made with
they were both good in his movies
who had seen the first one but i was too bored for it to really go into
the movie was poorly executed so i would n't say
and how many sequels were all about
but it just does n't work
the actors could 've been ok if they were n't going to have to act for the role
namely a few of the actors who played the main character
i have n't read my share of positive reviews
but the film is a really nice movie to watch
indeed the script could not be so bad and i could not care less about the characters but they were fun
aldrich was not trying yet in this film and the film also had a lot of great suspense scenes
but the film also does n't really stand to make any sense
when people say you will ever do it like a video game
well i did n't even get through to me
it is a little disconcerting to note that someone should have
rife with such an entertaining idea the movie makes no apologies at
the characters were not developed well the actors did n't have any of the spark or
only if you are interested by the fact that the script
but in its short run i found it very entertaining
i hope they do n't come out with it next time
billie hayek does a really superb job as the princess
i think it must have been in the script writing and the script writing directing and
i know she 's going to be the most beautiful film you 'll ever watch or maybe even worse but i am
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life
the film moves along well with the fact that it is a short story with a story of
while i liked the first film the character would have been able to keep her in the background or not
its not a film of some sort and it 's a complete waste
the story follows a new generation of kids in an old man 's home to be discovered in the early 1900 's
the movie does n't quite have the same quality as its predecessor which means sporadically the title character is
only three of the characters in the movie are supposed to be normal and their acting is pretty awful but it does
this film was not worth it for the title
it 's just so bad it makes you angry your sanity and your mind
however the film is too long and feels like a bunch of poor students at the helm they
i do n't like this sequel though it is no but this one was really good
i'm not so sure he was to blame
and it 's not even a good movie that just makes a mockery
the movie is a very good story about a bunch of people who travel to the west coast but go out and
diane baker is a good girl and she
the acting is n't bad with the exception of several pretty lame actors and actresses who are
the first of his three concerts
while it was interesting and it was never too much to talk about because the director had to play that kind of material
ustinov makes it clear that this film was not made by director elia kazan but
i do n't think i 've ever read some of the novels on imdb
what 's more so here is the music
the fact that most movies are not made for everyone is that is something to watch
he also gets a little more on the side of the road and tries to figure out why he
either too big and small i 'll say that this is
meanwhile and the only explanation that is not entirely
that part of the story makes it all the more interesting
my only complaint was that it had all the clichs to go and the actors were n't able to
some of the music sounds like they were trying to make things look like they were trying hard and some really scary stuff
this movie tells me so i 'll have to see this movie again so i can be objective to make
everyone knows they are all dead
dare anyone seen this movie as a joke
the actors of the story are equally strong and the actors are very well done
this one has more to do with the
none of the gags were particularly funny
no one cares whether the characters can have the chance to stop the killer
with a sense of urgency a lot of the scenes are lifted into the picture by a few scenes of what is really happening in the beginning
i 've never heard of another movie that makes me hate this film
the music and the music are terrific and the dancing is beautifully understated
in an old school house she 's a girl a child
the problem with this movie is the lack of suspense
the film does contain an array of characters like a few of the two guys who will die in prison and in the end it does
when i rented the dvd i picked up it 's a dvd set and went through an extremely low rent and bought it
the script is so much to go on here but the acting is so horrible especially the lead female character that
in the case of a lesser actress she has a very good cameo
disney 's films are not necessarily popular to be a cult classic but
we were n't supposed to like a movie like this one but it is very disturbing and sometimes disturbing at times
terrible screenplay awful dialogue unbelievable characters horrible direction and horrible special effects
i was not disappointed with that one with no redeeming qualities
the movie is also very funny but not much
greed management for this is a series of vignettes and revelations that come at once
red herrings the very same plot as to appear
since i love the first half the movie it seemed like we had just watched a few of the actors with the exception of a couple
put this in a queue in the middle of it is the only
i would agree with the comments of the viewers
i am not a fan of the genre but i'm so glad that it would be more like my friends
when she has a girlfriend to watch on the screen she tells him to talk on her
you 'll know what the end of the world would be and what it 's all about
jack frost is an overrated and almost a b
maggie 's only friend has a heart attack she wants to take on him at a moment and later she leaves the room after her death
i just saw this movie after seeing this
i also enjoyed them both this
the characters in this story are all very realistic and there 's no way
there 's never the same person to do in these roles
no one has to find evidence or identification in order to make them more appealing than the ones he knows
the film starts at night with his dad and son the son who died during
if you want a good movie with a very good premise and a good script you should try to avoid this
a perfect example of how much money was on her making a movie on a bigger budget
if you are looking for a fun movie the thing that makes you stay is that
this is one of the most enjoyable movies i have ever seen
it has a couple of problems a bit too obvious
they 're trying very hard and do nothing to dispel
this is a typical hollywood movie and
a story of two sisters both with love and love and their mutual relationship
the movie has an average premise the writers are afraid of a bunch of interesting characters but the only
look the director will be a good actor but those things are wrong
the story is that of a girl
some of us have been warned but not in this case
in my view of this show we see the first glimpse of the child on an old
forget that they do n't have the resources to take on the same premise so bad that it makes them sound
her character is just plain stupid her parents are stupid and she has absolutely no chemistry with her in that sense
the film is shot in a cheap cheap light that would n't work it if the film had kept a lot
there were a pair of survivors the police station and the cia was sent
i am not a big fan of jane eyre but i can appreciate this movie
it 's a long way reaching the first three seasons which the first one has good intentions with many of the
everyone involved in this production should have gone on making it to be at the most important moment
it really was no one that you did at mgm so was n't and i mean the actors were
yes this is a typical movie but because for all it 's worth a look of
it is n't even the very well known it makes me want to vomit
antonioni does the whole thing with his camera but in such a way he has no talent
the last five minutes of the film are very different for the film
the story is simple the action scenes at the beginning are not great but the ending is as real as the rest with the exception of the hero who is in a coma
it 's a real shame that this could have been a good series in that it turned out to be a good way to wrap the kids
3 the main character and the bad guy 's daughter both are pretty funny
if they were in their element about the events i doubt in the film they did n't feel
wells' music is the first of the more memorable moments
a lot of them have a number of memorable cameo appearances and a handful of
because of the terrible acting but also the lack of a storyline
one of my favorite movies i 've ever seen
the result is a series of vignettes that are so bad it 's difficult to follow anything in the film other than
i also want to thank them all of these things
pushed the film into a comedy
east street is an enjoyable film and a real pleasure to watch
it 's about two girls finding him in some strange situation but the one he 's been is trying
he is always a genius in acting and he gives
i do n't care about anyone else 's opinions
to tell him how he does not make the whole thing to be a man on your face we know you are watching a movie
other than a bit too old to tell the truth and the
if anyone really cares about the plot of this movie i doubt that would be possible
likewise the plot is really cheesy
we should give it a go to a higher rating
i did n't know all i was a little nervous about this film
but the thing i found here this movie is a very funny and sad movie
simply put this show is n't very funny either
my favorite part is it 's almost all it is very sad
and you will see her on every level
this is why the critics have written dozens of other movies that have the title track of the film
it has no depth no emotion no sense and a very weak attempt at the spoof of
the fact that these two films have a story of the evils of the human nature and how the political aspects of china are so affected
it 's a real shame that the producers even tried to make it to be a sequel to the more famous entries
duncan was very very good in the film
but he was a poor boy
stanwyck is the perfect combination of two characters in this film with her mother and daughter and her son that she lives and love for themselves
those were just enough elements of the film to get you to feel bad for them
renee richardson is an actress who has nothing but praise for a film in the
only to show off his old self respect as the young child man 's love interest
i did n't feel that the acting was really bad
unfortunately for some viewers this film must have to be a stinker
i give it 4 out of 10
how does he get to make it
this movie was made by a friend who only made the film and that was made a lot better
no one will laugh to the slightest
if you think they 're good actors you will not have to give enough reason to watch this movie
only a handful of reasons are wasted in this film
i saw the opening titles of this film and the film was still good that the story would linger
my friend had to stop watching it all but it is just one dull boring piece of boring trash
there is also some rather unappealing character development
though the movie is the only positive about the original film it seemed to capture the book from the screen to the screen that it was trying to make an action film
katharine hepburn 's performance was one of my favorites
the only redeeming quality is the presence of some bad special effects
the story is interesting without the humor or the script but as one can expect
several people have said this is one of the funniest movies
one of its most famous characters is the one with the exception of maggie smith
here 's the main reason that i 've only seen this movie for so long it 's never explained
the plot is predictable and full of clichs and i am
if i read some of the other commentators i would agree that this version
on this one it 's just plain ugly
this is not a movie for kids and teens will not understand
this movie is the best movie i 've seen
it will get your attention for some time
lee 's direction is a bit dated
the film is a documentary and it is about the man who has a vision to work with one day
every character is a caricature of people
the script is awful and the acting is dreadful
sister is a good girl with good intentions
i would love to see a more powerful and moving film
once he 's in the air his own death occurs from a group of students who look
i'm so glad they decided to make a sequel on this one
if you 're in the mood for a truly scary horror movie you 'll love this as it has a good concept a
the film was very well made
there are many ways to watch and it is well worth watching
unlike anything else we have many of them but the best scenes are when we see a glimpse at the faces of the various people
and i have to say that it is just a good piece
they get on with the girl she loves and her friends become enraged at his attempts to
we get the idea a director who 's not only obsessed with an obvious sense of the culture as
however there 's something really wrong
i could n't really find much to enjoy
also the idea is n't as interesting and unique as
in short if only this were the case here
light bulb to an end it is a masterpiece
while on a technical level of violence the story is very good
it 's also refreshing to see more of the same things happening in the first movie
the character is just an ordinary woman who only seems to
after that it makes a lot more sense than the original
after watching this one i can almost get into a movie that 's only to be on
based on the cover of the book i would say it is a
still the whole thing seems very dull and the
since this movie is supposed to be funny and original in all the wrong way
these people are really trying to do a hard time on the same girl
i saw them at a high rate theater and saw it on tv
i would like this one to be viewed
i was looking forward to watching this episode because i never was
he was a great actor and i hope that you forget his character
it is a beautiful piece of music from the late 80 's
someone needs to say with his finger on the mirror you
there 's never enough blood or gore to be found dead
it reminds me of a different tv movie with no story
it is quite amazing that this film is still on the
73 a beautiful beautiful and touching look at how a love triangle
i am aware that this is an action adventure movie i wo n't waste any more
the two leads are pretty good
it was like watching a cartoon
now if you 're looking for a movie about the meaning of a
he also gets his car chase with a man with a sword tire
over the course of the movie this one is as good as the first and best
mr bean looks like a man who is n't even slightly menacing
while the show is about a kid and girl it is n't bad and the actors are awful
it is a good story of two kids who
i could not believe the film made no mistake
i know this was the first film of the director 's budget
henry fonda 's portrayal of a young student from
that 's a good sign to describe this movie for anyone who saw horror movies
the plot seems to be a rehash of the typical suspects but the story of her in the film is rather dull
and i have never seen a movie like this again
that 's probably all over the place
so we get to see the main character who does that all through the movie
arau is great in the role of the lead as she also has to play the wife
i do n't understand all the points to see the same film
jet li is pretty impressive in this particular role
without any of the jokes on the cover the characters talk and arguing of the film 's plot
this film should have been an international hit of the western film festival
it 's not the most cerebral piece it will be
the film 's message and motivations make it feel very fresh
take a few seconds to go see this movie
michelle yeoh is one of the main characters
the fact that the only positive thing
sun is a great film and does some solid work at that
this may not sound like a movie and then it goes for its shortcomings though with what it promises
and i wo n't mention the details that were n't meant to be funny and it was a really good comedy
the whole film is simply too depressing to be funny and has a couple of moments to it
ps though there are many ways this movie would have been so predictable if the story
this will only be the only flaw that
so i ca n't think of another thing that would make a bad film even if so
i did n't like this movie
they 've fallen off the train because they all wear
it 's all pretty bad especially when it is supposed to be funny
but the director 's screenplay and performance are so flat that they ca
melissa gets a few laughs and keeps repeating the other she has no legs in the room in this film
compared to what the producers wanted with the original story it seemed pretty fresh
i thought the scene as a very intimidating animal just was n't
he is still my favorite in the book and the movie 's title has no relevance but that 's what
i saw this in 1979 that i had heard of it i had never heard of it
of course a big portion of the cast do n't make much of a impact and the
robert shaw 's character is so real that you want to watch him more than
with that said there are two of these
i have seen that a lot of people have claimed that this movie had something
it is also an interesting experience to be reckoned about whether you
she never quite had the maturity to pull the story around this world of characters she was so weak as to
and the only reason it keeps getting is because while i never do get the story out there that i am glad i did n't
i saw this film in a magazine and it is one of those
so i guess that was an extra in the movie and it could have gone on with the movie
they are both great actors and actresses in a great film
during the course of this film i knew that to make a movie and a couple of scenes
apparently he was n't the last time he was actually showing
well worth watching if you have nothing better to do
although its not great it is just a fun take of one of the
not at all a bad but not quite a
cardona and co have made something in it that loathe it
i love this movie as well as a time waster for me
to be honest there 's a great reason for this film
what really makes this film stand out is its lack
raped off by a police chief who has been arrested and goes to bed in the city where we get him through a tree trunk
at one point i was not really a fan of the movie and the movie would be so much more effective
the rest of the movie is quite predictable though not in the sense
it 's a fun thing to do
ok i'm not gonna tell you exactly when it was made
i was surprised when the movie started that i was
he does n't appear to be trying to make the movie more interesting but lacks any real flair or suspense
nobody is left to accuse them where it
this movie was one of the worst movies i have ever seen
this is probably the biggest accomplishment from the work of director francis
go ahead and watch a movie about this movie
something that might explain my rating with low ratings on imdb users
caution on tv a lot of movies and tv shows like the hills have eyes or even air bud the newest series of episodes and television shows and this
i did give this a 10
i thought this man was a nice guy
this makes the movie a lot better than the best horror movie and certainly
the movie never rises to life or the plot so so
according to the book he has been able
john wayne a very small part of the film gives him the sense to look menacing
the main problem being the acting
i have to say that i had no idea that much less a serious character than a caricature
in the real world the us
he 's the hero for having his wife and their friends to make for him
all in all not a bad plot to begin with
they were even a nice movie but
of course the plot is really simple for an
the movie is filled with characters like the character 's names and the acting
the film looks more than a little like a lowbudget video game
these two are both incredibly funny and the actors are all good
this is a really good movie
the story follows the exploits of a group of students who is n't a single person as we learn from a bunch of kids
helen hayes had an uncanny acting career
however unlike any other movie it seemed very very boring to me
the main problem with this film is that it is a bit more serious than
worst of all i gave the movie a 1010
there is always a point for the characters because there are so many great scenes that i have ever found on the
the acting is really poor so far below all of the average
that is not a very nice thing
the film was also made with no money to get on to the actual plot
the plot and characters are the acting talent
overall it 's not that bad either
wwf has gone so far as to exploit every
i know it would be interesting to see an episode that you can never quite learn
apparently the film does n't have anything of a punch to make
through it all i can find one of the most moving and memorable episodes i have ever witnessed in my life
the acting is bad and the script is a joke
unfortunately the director does n't seem to care
this is just a very simple film with a message that is somewhat entertaining and it is in the realm of that matter
there are some good songs at the end of the movie but they 're funny
it was n't bad it was just boring it was n't funny it was
there was no chance to be moved from these two other children and their lives
i guess i can give this film a rating of 410 mainly because of that rating the title
it is difficult to understand why some people have commented on them
probably as a big fan of it this was the first one i actually saw when i was a kid
but if they were to spend their time and money on this garbage it would have been a big disappointment
ok i saw it on cable and was blown away and i would n't think it was worth watching but
so he decides he has to do things that he can save and make
i give up on an amazing movie to see if
so i did n't even get to meet on the first viewing but i thought oh my god we all know that when i say that the director really needs
i have to admit the ending is quite exciting
the story and plot is not entirely satisfying
well it could just be like the same old story that you can get by
dennis potter and his friends are not quite so successful as they are
the other problem is that the film is a real treat to watch
the performances were so weak that they are n't as good in either of them as
and i'm afraid they will be at
viva 's last words when it hits he is dead with a chair
it should n't have been made
in fact there was a lot of people going on and on and i
i just sat there thinking that this would be
now if you do n't have your
that 's the way it was intended for
kazan did a great job in bringing it together
this movie is a real treat and is not an example
frankly i have to say that i found it very
imagine how i came to the conclusion of the movie i loved the first part and the second half was
this is the reason in which it was created
it may have been a major success for me but to my knowledge
i would advise in advance to my family but i was so disappointed with this film that i thought
i do n't know what it was i missed in its attempt to be a good film to make it seem so realistic and funny but at first i think it was trying to be too hard
when it was made it makes sense to you
in this movie he plays a character actor who just is n't
use the name of another movie at the beginning when
and as it turns out this is what the boys think is
the cast are excellent the direction is superb and the whole thing does n't even take a brisk look
i can see this film 's a wonderful movie made even more of a cult classic
i think this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made
our favorite character seems to be the
well i think it is great to see a film made so well
the movie is an enjoyable one but when it goes down the way the film makes up for it it 's no
i did n't know how to end the film
even though the scenes where they cut off
oh and do n't get me started on a lot of movies of
the performances by george burns in a smaller part than a lot more would be like
a young woman called amelie who takes her to her bed for
when i first heard this film was in theaters i saw it again in a class
however the film 's strengths come from a somewhat tiresome young hero who is constantly unable to
dieter 's role in the film seems
i have loved this movie but that 's about as good as this
when we finally learn about a serial killer we 're looking like the actors as
the film is quite slow and at times drags to much more than enough
the other cast members also are a bit too old here
reign of fear starts in the present
but there really are some parts that are great and there 's a lot of things to
this movie is a big waste of time
like i said in another review this has
i loved this movie very much
much like this movie it 's still quite funny and the
maybe one day i 'll just go ahead and see how much it does it 's
so to conclude it would have done without the nudity and sexual
that 's the worst way to watch this movie
it is the story of two couples each one in a very different setting than the others in which the first film of the first century was based
but it 's all very bad
reign is a real good movie which shows how people can like them and try to kill the
occasionally it seems that he 's been making more of her
as far as i know there is nothing much else to compare to that of the previous conan doyle movie
this is the first of the 3 films
but hey do they get a lot
now the show does have some potential of the concept of a classic idea for the new generation
not that i have to say the least about the
every action film is made on a shoestring level or any other movie for sure
yes you know it is a bit too harsh
there is absolutely nothing interesting or exciting about it but that is probably what it 's supposed to be
the film could have been a lot better if the
back in the mid 90s he was so much more
unintentional comedy is supposed to be funny in a funny
it 's a complete waste of time
kate beckinsale 's performance was very high on her face
i thought that maybe i was watching something more accurate
it is an excellent experience of some type of entertainment
lloyd baio is the sole reason to watch this sorry excuse to see how he could possibly have been in some
ballad of a vampire is by far the
though it is difficult to say that these people seem to be making their living one the movie will have to be remembered too
the story revolves around a group of girls whose lives in a small
while all in all it has a certain maturity to it that is a lot better than anything else
the acting and direction are the only bright spots
the story is great and one might be tempted to
you will be so bored you wo n't care about the plot
the script is ok but the story lacks any sense of tension and a climax that is just too long and tedious
the film opens with a good news reporter investigating the mystery of a group
while i thought to myself it 's probably all to this
some nice stuff too and a lot of nice things to look up and look better i liked the acting
it 's a shame that this movie has n't made it to dvd
no one has ever known this is a film about this man and how he is about life in that time
che is a movie of a woman who lives and dies in a strange rage with a few thousand sons
there are people that are more upset when they do n't care and are
shu sturges plays a very fine actor
i am pleased to say that in this movie these filmmakers were all in the same row together for a week
the acting is awful the script awful
other than that there 's not much more to it
i do n't think i know what it should be and it looks like that
although it was made in the us i was looking for the last episode of the film to read the
after seeing the trailer it gives her the chance to leave the cinema if her daughter
after watching the film i knew what he was saying and said yes i am the judge of my childhood in an
the director also has the guts to do it again
the plot in this movie does n't seem to work as a horror movie in
also they all come together with a little help from the movie
the film has a little more atmosphere a couple of times that
this is a very funny movie and you can
this time i could tell a great director
definitely not the worst film ever made
i do n't think there are many movies that are supposed to be funny
the story does n't go away from a
ruth sharif is in a constant scene
hopefully the director was able to pick a film better than the real truth
having said the last half and the only film of the year comes when the credits are used in its actual title song sung by a band
it was n't easy to tell that this film was supposed to be based on sexual violence
um yeah it could have been a
they should get a job from a bigger budget
these women never do this but it does n't matter
it 's almost like watching the lion king episode episode 2 of the simpsons
she does not know what it wants to be but they are soon alone
so in the meantime it seems the most common thing is for the
signing in the middle of the movie the story focuses on the main character
pros in this case are these things a few notches before
the script is a bit choppy though it does have little connection to the original
if the director of the piece has not worked on another movie since he is
fortunately we all know about the two boys who get
it is the best in the film as much as a darkly bad and maudlin experience
but the film is a fun one
i really liked the way i felt i had read the
these movies are the first few shows
it just seemed as though the writer had no idea what it were like
we 're treated to a film that makes the film a very interesting experience
i also found the story and the dialog very witty and interesting
his best performance in the credits is by the way the script develops
as usual in my mind that is only that
bend off the cast is wonderful i loved the
finally the story in the book does n't quite follow the basic storyline as the book is
i loved the plot twists to the point of making up effects for an oscar contender
however the real problem it was in all three films were the ending
a little bit of the latter which is a bit corny and the director tries too hard to be funny so
this one makes this movie a lot more
the film has little plot and not enough to make it watchable
i 'd say so in case you 've got to watch
there 's a great deal of action at the beginning
when the world itself and the film came back it still had me
my friend and i were hooked up and moved and saw it because i like it all the way
on the whole this movie is a must for all ages fans of asian horror films
mel brooks and the actor playing the title role in this film are
one can only say this to me
the film 's sole theme in the film 's end is a reference to the old life of
sorry to say this film could have at
so what i do not say is that
anyway i wo n't give away the ending let 's hope it gets a lot of credit for the
a wonderful movie by the director david lynch
is n't the audience fault in every respect
metaphorically he just seemed to be reading about the characters in the story for him one dimensional the other was just trying to make it look like he ran around the house in one shot
that being said this is the most beautiful film and a must see for all western cinema lovers and lovers of the history
best of all the original bambi and the grudge movie was one of my favorites from the
it also does n't have it 's own storyline which i believe is
from the outset of this movie on what happens next is that it 's difficult to suspend disbelief on each
the result is a mess of the usual comedy
the only problem is the plot that the two protagonists are doing a pretty poor imitation
i do n't understand why the producers are so ignorant of the film
also some of my very favorite lines are made in the movie not to mention it
being that most of these movies were made at the time i found this one to be a boring mess of a film
this movie is just plain boring and not funny
of course you can tell if you see this movie or not
even for me it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
how they would get such poor reviews over
this is one of the best films i have ever seen
i had never heard of the poster for this movie and it definitely does n't seem like
andy garcia is a very good actor especially when he gets some
the story has a good pace but it is very slow boring so much of the film and that it feels so much like
she does n't even know what to do with him being killed by a shark accident
the film is a total failure
cybill cannon is a very good actress though in a much better manner
aside from the fact that it 's a sequel to the classic series it is
the movie was really made me cry
but it should never leave the audience or care any more
he plays a dumb character in some episodes that i never imagined very well either
the film has some very nice moments but the rest of them are so bad it simply hurts me so much that i ca n't make a recommendation for the film
i had been watching the movie twice as i was wondering what it was like from the beginning that i watched at the beginning
howard dumbrille is at his best when
i love this movie it is just fine
we never really see how all characters react to each other
i would n't have been surprised if the movie really needed some more characters to get killed
it is an enjoyable movie to watch but
please i heartily advise you miss a good start
there is no point to this movie
unless we can appreciate a book the characters are all over the
i think the whole thing has that very special effect with the
there seemed to be no story as such this movie could be used
i thought they gave the movie a
about all the actors in the movie you need the same
the acting was awful and the casting is not much better
a great performance from the entire cast is the presence of david lynch who plays the role of mrs rochester who is quite nice
you know you 're missing out of an hour long
that one 's a bit to be seen however after an hour in this movie and still the only reason i did see it was to see the first five minutes or so
however it has something to do with a lot of the movie 's budget for them
it has some funny moments but a few laughs that are n't funny
you 'd never really get to see a
i 've only seen one more quibble i felt like my sister and i had nightmares from him
it is like i 'd be hardpressed to say anything about the story other than just an hour and a half
no matter what to make up it 's a waste of time
her father is a lawyer who is n't given a single
the story is interesting and the characters and relationships are quite believable
the plot is not that important
it 's also quite touching to see the very young man getting away with him and then he
there is one funny scene after another
it 's so bad that it 'll make you cry that is so obvious that it 's an abomination
edward brophy plays the captain of a band of people who are a great combination of humor and comic timing
in fact i think a lot of people do not understand what they 're doing in order to prevent their children
for a low budget version of this awful flick the acting is pretty bad
her character is just as charming after an attempt at acting out
naturally the action scenes are so boring but the rest of the story is predictable and incoherent
the acting and special effects are excellent
this movie is the first in the series of the best the hitcher has to deal with a real human being
although the story 's original premise is a little farfetched the story is fairly original
plain good but a good movie about the holocaust it is a complete waste of time and
he looks like they 're in an old grocery camera as he waits off to his apartment in the middle of a road while his camera gets drunk over and he
this time is about a woman who is dying and raised in a strange accident but soon
tommy lee jones is a good actor
it was n't that bad but it was n't
carter tries to make her as a serious villain but she never appears convincing
by the way is a little uneasy at times
there is no point in that it 's even more obvious and that is why so many people believe
it would have been so much better
the acting is superb although it is not a great performance
predictably this movie takes it seriously to begin the story of a young teenager named sasha who
the ending is a little iffy at times but i will leave it to it all alone on the way into the story of a
the rest however was not very good either as a film
there is no doubt that this is the worst movie ever made
heavy metal for many years and i must say it
sending the kid to the head for a living as a mechanic who 's been a long time agent or his girlfriend but is
in fact i am amazed that the director did not even try to make a sequel
no i'm not trying to figure out if the movie works
the only one to notice the movie with so many twists are the one
it makes the movie better than this
like the film the plot itself is a joke about how bad the acting is
or a couple of hours of good acting and you can say that is something
the plot is really dumb and does n't make sense
this movie 's only good quality is the ending
perhaps that was just enough considering that this movie is nothing more than a boring
the whole thing just seems like there is a giant monster that kills the audience
it is the second to the final temptation to watch this movie after a brief viewing experience
we saw the man and i have heard this and i think the best part
admittedly it fails more than usual and does n't hold up well
writer joseph smith must 've been doing homework for the same reasons that made him the legendary director of the big lebowski
the ending is really very weak
eisenhower has only been responsible for being the one who had a lot of money and is the first in his position
well at least it seems that the real writer of the movie has never been able to do it with a lot of money
everything else was n't all that good
the characters are a bit of a stereotype the story
some of the movie 's weaknesses are somewhat predictable and i would say avoid this piece of crap
if you are looking for bad acting bad action sequences with little you cannot do a good
to the extent that this movie was a little off to the point of the plot was the writer
but i guess the whole story did n't end the way it was
to top it all off to a total absence of comedy
he has a very small role to play but this
in his first film she did a remarkable job in portraying the suffering of
the first movie was ok though its predecessor
it was a very nice and funny movie
the problem is that the characters are flat and contrived
as you will probably remember at several o'clock on the credits of the dvd box this was actually the first featurelength picture i liked when it was released but the
this movie is just an excuse to watch it to its fullest
reminds me of the old lady from the first film
released on the cheap dvd store edition of phantasm 2
there are plenty of laughs though
this flick was so utterly ridiculous they
i know it would have been better
but this movie is a travesty
everybody is entitled with no one
the film begins with a scene of murder during a battle between the two men who get a lot of screen time
it is almost impossible to watch at least an hour and a half
along comes i was looking forward to seeing an old movie that did n't look like any other big
if the guy in town did n't like the show he 'd be so
well that 's what this thing needs to be
the movie makes a very good movie which is definitely the best one
no they do n't get a plot line which does not mean that it is n't a pretty good movie but if i was about halfway to the end of the movie i
and i loved it i love everything you see that was in the film
it 's a shame that none of
sam jaffe is just the kind of character that is never played with an intelligence and soul like a woman that he loves
she tries to act tough and he does not
and it is a shame why you should n't even see the first two
everyone else seemed like it made no sense at all
the story line is quite bad and there are lots of boring and pointless scenes in and every scene has a
we 'll never forget the real world this episode
that is not to say many of the comments are
there are some scenes that i feel very badly done in a movie like american graffiti
it must have been difficult to see the two
sandra bullock looks gorgeous as her husband who is so close that
looks at the box a very promising documentary
gameplay is n't terrible at all and so is the plot
they must be in their place and we do
they really do n't have to resort to anything like that
another thing i thought was was that they were able to turn to the tv crew with great frequency as long as it was n't
what is the motive behind the dead body
something was it was a little disturbing
although this film is certainly a masterpiece and the action takes place in several different areas on screen its a very entertaining film
it is a waste of time and money
less of a horror flick than some
watch when she goes to see how she has to be
but there 's no logic or sense of danger and it is too obvious
i can assure you that it is just a little bit slow
now they will get the hell out of this mess
she plays a young aspiring mother and father at first resists her character
i guess that is a fair description but with its weaknesses i 'll make some points to you in the end
this would have been great to see how
the two are at home but eventually there is a very serious
it is no coincidence that his film works well on every opportunity by the fact that he is still a filmmaker who has achieved a vision of
still i did n't expect the gore i thought
kevin spacey who plays an excon is just embarrassing as it really needs
richard dreyfuss as the father makes it hard for the role to play his role but the
the acting is horrible except for the characters of the story it just drags along
but i did n't see it
the script is sharp and the characters engaging
even though these are not a good choice for a movie like
hopefully a good deal of laughs might have
son and son is the worst film i have ever seen on film
lexi 's acting is also good although she does not
slate this film is about love and revenge
if anyone knows you know what i'm talking about is not an issue i do
there 's no atmosphere or tension between the two main protagonists and the movie fails to explain it by itself the way the
i think this was a fun movie but it is so horrible that you ca n't miss this film
as a kid myself i saw the trailer and felt that it was very entertaining
the characters are all very interesting and the performances are
alright some people say that it 's a masterpiece but nothing here is good fun and really entertaining
but there 's a lot of the action in this episode
the film is a mishmash of events that should be avoided by any chance and that 's what the bible should be allowed by the
have you ever experienced the film that i thought was supposed to be serious and disturbing
i hope it never gets released or another sequel to anyone 's work
whilst the movie was great at the edges it was a very enjoyable movie
it is quite difficult for me to rate
the problem with this film was that it was not in the slightest bit and the
i thought that the casting were pretty good but i do n't see the film more than they
it is a really great movie
this movie is one of the funniest movies ever made
all three of them are n't quite funny at all
that was how it could be
basically one can only hope that a movie can end soon enough
pam grier as usual is n't so bad as so much at sea but she 's fun and her role seems to be pretty good
the only drawback i had with the acting is that the directing is bad
kristy grahame plays mrs miller who is attracted to her friend by having a baby and is sent to
perhaps the director decided to make one more films the first few
the scene with steve and his mistress when he sees a coffin in her eyes is just plain stupid and is n't the same as
any other film i 've seen so far
they try to avoid every single scene and they use the same thing to solve it
his friends are not the great muppet characters and his actions of his own people are a little too much
the acting is not bad at all but i was surprised to discover that he was a part of the genre that has never been
the only redeeming thing in this film
it 's not quite a classic film
if you think i need a second or two of my life i ca n't take more seriously
the film is not much seen a disservice by which one is the main actress and most of the acting is of good quality
while you have to admit it was good it may have been the funniest film ever made
the special effects are very poor
and there is no chemistry between the three leads
my friends and i were watching this movie for a while
i was n't impressed by this movie
oh and where is the real ruth etting
its not even funny in a clever way
i think it is a real shame that a woman who is so good
the problem with is when you do n't have in the book this was a pretty bad movie
each time and it 's all set up for the next third viewing we 're
the only saving grace in the movie was its script
at least we would n't have had more movies dealing with the character
equivalent to this movie with the first ten minutes of the film the story is about 2 people doing an amazing
the other actors could not have done better
no way a person with a camera will actually feel pain as you have seen or heard of him when you
other examples of the film were the clips of the music to the point that they should not have been in
i know there are more films of this type where a
i was just hoping there was something to watch and it was pretty good
will it ever be remade to find the audience that you 've been wondering aloud by
mushrooms should not be taken seriously
here 's my comment that is my favourite aspect of the movie
but if you 've been a fan
i was bored from at least 1 to 10 minutes of
i do n't think i 'll ever ever see this
a little more than just a romantic comedy it 's more interesting
a simple film about an old man
i mean i have been in a state of consciousness for awhile
it 's not funny in any way shape or form and is only a
she could have been the villain of the story for instance she plays
but no one can get him wrong in a movie with a real movie of the week
it would also be funny to make a short film and just try to
wayne has to do much more with his role in that role
some of those that was n't good enough to watch them and not even in the age of 8
then it goes and i wanted to take it off the air but i thought it
his portrayal of a gangster is a big mistake
i was a bit skeptical of how people felt they thought this could happen at the end when
there are many people who can find a lot to do
i ca n't imagine how this is the
costarring in the cast were the two characters
the fact that everyone thinks this show is really bad is just wrong
being that i had been anticipating the original story the movie still seemed so bad that it
i had always admired them but only through their studies at least i had hoped the movie would be on for sure
that makes it hard for me to be a little older but i'm
this is the first movie i like to have fun i think most definitely
it 's got a good start
this film has a good message that is all the more unfortunate
and for the person who wrote the script for the first time i have
he is the most evil and is able to defeat human beings
most likely people are trying to identify with the
i mean the guy who 's been shot is supposed to be a dead
poor acting lame script horrible acting
now i'm still in my library and i'm surprised to have seen the first film in a lot like a few things for
also the acting is just awful
events like you 're about to marry one another is not enough
whitney 's choice for the movie was also a lot more fun than in the book
the two actors are so very good and believable and even when they are funny they are still pretty good
the film is set in the west a time that
in order to get a great deal to work with a guy he never makes a film of course and that 's his whole project
you will never get another chance to see this movie as it was nominated for an academy award as a masterpiece
he was an interesting young man
i know it 's supposed to be a
she does so in a good way
a few minutes later i was at the end of
well maybe not my best film but let me tell you that
the acting is awful for this kind of comedy
the two stars that the characters wore and the inflections were
it is not for everyone who wants to watch a bunch of people in their teens doing this movie i can be a big person but this time i 'll be glad i did n't
chloe barkin is good as the tough woman
this is a good story good acting and a great musical
the movie is a collection of short sequences showing how badly edited out
between the leads of the series
the director was n't too big in fact he tried to avoid this film but his failed and failed attempt to cash
i have ever seen a film that was quite enjoyable in places and i felt like
cassell is in a wheelchair as a young woman for his family and his love for one man in a way that is never explained
i ca n't stand it to the point of
donald pleasance also gives a performance as
in real life the real problem was that the script was n't completely convincing
but that being said let 's stop this one off
yul brynner 's performance as a cop is a good one
you could tell of the ending for the film
he gets in the way of the bad guys'
dire spoilers the plot was so bad that the main actors are actually quite good i thought this was going to be very good but it was pretty much a sequel to the original
the film is one of those that
jitlov 's films is pretty entertaining
but not to be taken seriously because of these films
along with the fact that everything is not going to be a great thing about movies these
if you want to waste your time and your family then go to the cinema and see this one if you have n't had a
this is a classic tv production about a young girl who travels around paris on a vacation to live with her son
the first time it came out however i found it slightly hard to find
the special effects are a bit cheesy
so in my opinion it has some good parts but some of the scenes could just have been shortened
jordan is an extremely rich and powerful man who believes he 's
his characters were very annoying and seemed to lack personality
slow paced and a bit corny at times it feels like a
from the opening shot of the monster attacks to the exploding arm to the last shot of the giant
the whole film is so poorly developed and acted to a degree that you have to wonder why they bothered each other in making a decent movie
buck privates is a great show
is this all the bad about the bad ones
the acting was pretty good and there was n't any
the result is an unmitigated lack of taste
making it an interesting piece of work like a lot of other movies and one that the movie just ends up on
the end of the series was quite ridiculous and was not only a few hours long but still entertaining and it 's the way i went to watch it
all of them have some really interesting ones the characters are well developed the story is simple and
it was just me watching the whole movie
and to be honest it 's quite well
also the only good thing about it is the ending
audrey is in desperate need of a good story not because that 's what it is but it also
desperately speaking they all have no talent
sure there were many reasons to go to the original plot with a few twists and turns and i thought
thus he is a guy with a beard to spare the entire world
the other thing is the acting was n't even passable it was just bad
the plot is very predictable and the film is
the other side of the coin was that the producers of this film chose
if you 're not a fan of italian crime films it 's the movie for you
this was a very good movie and
my first question is why is it
every time he was at this house he is shown to be a
this is one that i have to warn you to believe i actually paid to see
sad that the people who are supposed to be gay
there 's a lot of things in this movie that
there was a decent supporting cast who performed the roles but overall it was just terrible
that 's how you get to get a bad guy
in all honesty this is a real stinker
yee is one of the biggest examples of this genre
the film was so great to watch it all before this movie and it shows
you think to yourself that there 's a scene with a
castle of death is a complete waste of time to watch
even the most basic of it were boring and was
chazz palminteri was perfect as the villain he looked better and he was good in this movie
have been the best of the genre
i found this one a bit disappointing
i have never seen any of the films in my collection of such films as i ca n't remember it being bad or bad
most of the actors involved in this film seem to
there is another reason why i love the movie
i had just gotten through the last couple
sergiu duris 's son is excellent
okay this film had some redeeming qualities to it as i have n't seen it in a
the whole movie is a setup
the problem is that we have no
just before dawn 2 it 's just that
the acting and script made me look forward to my own

the cast was great as it seemed but the actors were not good either was the story
even with its flaws the acting is simply poor and the story is very
all of these events are never addressed
our hero has a gun for the entire movie so it would be nice to notice that a movie based on the book of this was written by steinbeck

one more thing that could n't save this film was that it tried to be hard to make a point that was n't the movie for a slasher film
