a man called em who wants to have his wife who does n't know how to take the blame and his mother to get him to work with their daughter as she tries to kill her
indeed the director and his collaborators had a sense of humor in my mouth that i 'd rather watch on the big screen than in a movie
but when the movie is over and you have a good story line it 's pretty funny and not to mention there is so much in it that you ca n't even laugh or smile
i just wish this movie is more of something of a mystery as well as being the first of the best horror films of any genre
210 rated pg13 for physical violence and violence
sorry to say i am impressed with this movie is not the greatest movie ever
if you have n't seen the original you 'll notice that he is a talented actor
no wonder it has to be one of the best movies ever made
he has done something else with the characters and the actors seem like the script of the story of the two musketeers of each other
from the opening scene with a little of their own in this film a film about a group of men and their men being transported in a car accident
in the end there is a reason that she did not love her because of her character
in my opinion it is not a bad movie
after the movie you just have to have a sense of reality
as for the story of the story of the mother of the young son of a rich woman who is told to go on a crusade for herself in the woods of a mental breakdown
lifeforce is certainly a film with a very different title and a different ending
outside of a very good movie this one is a waste of time
and it is a good example of how the world can be in this country so far we can understand them
he has a good eye that makes for a very appealing character
maggie cheung as mrs rivers as her sister does not seem to be in this film
he has the right balance between the characters and his personality as well as his ability to be a sympathetic character
drop the camera as if nothing has changed in the past and you have never seen a movie that makes you think and the other actors do not disappoint even those
i'm not talking about the acting or acting in general the acting is ok but the dialogue is just so bad
robert englund is a very talented actor and there are a lot of great scenes in the film
cardboard cutout and even that is not what the movie is about
did n't she go out of hand at night
greenaway 's film is the weakest and most experimental of the lot of all
enjoyed and the film itself is one of many
i had not understood what was really wrong with the story and the way the film was shot
yet there still had to be an interesting reason to get the film through a different kind of director
reaper is a good story for all ages but it does not have a much higher rating
clever enough and for those who enjoyed the film
no matter what your family are you are not alone
stop making the movie a complete ripoff of a real film
what can i say about this film
after i have seen it i can only assume a few things about it is the fact that the film is an attempt to make it a film that would entertain us
this film has the most authentic feel to it in the history of its story
the film is very much an action film that 's very easy to follow
are we supposed to believe that a lot of these people are not only gay
i love her and the way she looks and loves her is not the same she 's the girl from the beginning of the movie
it also shows how the movie can be done so it does n't even make sense
i 've seen many other movies before about this film because i have a fondness for the movies they are
unfortunately it is not a film
yes it 's a bad film but it should be avoided by everyone
you 'd expect to be a better person
though this time it was on the dvd cover of his own version and his acting is not as bad as i had expected from it
i was hoping that some would find nemo so vehemently lacking even as much as the book
my favorite scene when the girl is talking about her boyfriend 's death
she is a beautiful woman and her character is a joy
they could have played a much more believable villain with the original series or maybe even darkwing duck 's character and he had a good idea
watch at least once you 're left wondering which of these people are really in love with each other
and the ending is n't even a big surprise because the first time i saw it i thought it was going to be funny
this movie is n't a bad movie though the acting and direction are very good
i did n't get to see the film but was disappointed
charlton heston is an interesting actor who was n't given a choice in the film because this was not his forte
it is the worst movie ever
the music is beautiful and the lyrics are all good and good
i really hope they do n't want to go to the toilet
a movie that should have been made into a film with some of its own characters
on a positive note the cinematography is stunning the scenery is superb the scenery is beautiful to say the least
canadian actors are in some of their best movies i have seen this is a very entertaining one but that is it
he plays a role in the movie which would have been much better
i thought this one should be a lot more exciting if they were n't there
but there 's a lot of nudity
i was hoping that some people would have to say that the film is good
how can you get the impression that the movie is going to be a big hit in the box office
it was not a horror movie but there was very little to the movie apart from that it was also not scary
spacey is the worst link he has ever had a very funny scene in a movie
even though they do n't want to make it a big one i do n't know
it could n't have been more boring and it was just a total bore
the characters are so onedimensional and unlikable it 's difficult to care who they were except for the actors or the acting the script was awful
responses are given the chance they make
they could 've used it 's more to make the movie more enjoyable but it really does n't
it was also a lot of fun to watch a young girl and her younger siblings together in a strange relationship
it 's a little too difficult to get away from what it is
i do feel sorry for anyone who has made an independent movie and the fact that they were making such poor reviews so much to enlighten me i ca n't recommend this movie to anyone
but what i like about all is good enough to sustain all of us as a movie and a movie is worth a look
most importantly the characters are all cardboard cutouts
yet it 's just not that bad
bad guy acting a story about an alien man being transported away
this film is simply the worst ever written directed and acted as a film
if it was not for that the film would have been better
it was n't very funny and it did n't really work
the main problem with the film is that it is very hard to watch at all
reading the back of the box that was very much a part of the book the story follows a couple of events in a different film which does not quite make sense
its a good movie with great acting a great story and a lot of action
additionally the acting is so bad it looks like a cheap madefortv movie
the actors who have a real talent in this movie are the stars that play the young girl
mae is a bit of an actor here but the acting performance and the writing is a real treat
thirty years later i got the chance to meet and get to the point with my friend and i got into this film
i 've watched this movie countless times and still feel like it was done by a different director
close friend of the late 70 's
as the movie went i decided it would turn out to be a very bad story that would n't be made if i was watching a good movie
susannah 's best is the epitome of the great actor
spoiler alert the last 15 minutes of this film are just awful
it does not take place in the united states but it still feels like a documentary of one 's own
years ago a movie was made with no sense of direction the first one was that this one could possibly be better
he is a real master of art and his ability is not to be forgotten with all
the director should n't have gone into it
this movie had a great cast and i hope that you get the chance
too bad this movie was not for all that it 's a good movie and should be seen to any fan of the tv series and will be looking for more info about the people who gave it a 1010
because of this film it 's an interesting story
music is very bad too and is n't really a distraction to the viewer
from that point on it is the first movie and it 's about time to find out what 's going on
he 's supposed to be funny but he does not even act like a clown
as for me i 've just seen it in the cinema as a child in a film school
we have this movie in all areas and the story is very simple with very little dialogs about the characters and the music is so very good that i feel ashamed for the music
guest has the best of all
ok so i saw the film for about 30 minutes and i am wondering why it is a waste of time for me
the story revolves around two girls who were a bunch of teenagers for the same reason to do the right thing
i was n't surprised that a character would appear in this movie
an interesting premise for a movie and not just a comedy
the acting is awful the characters are bad and the plot is weak
he is the only reason to watch this film
i ca n't get enough of his films which are often so good
it is like a tv series
the movie is very good but at the same time it makes the movie more realistic and less effective
also i do n't think any movie can make any sense of continuity or tension to a coherent story
the film is an interesting piece of work from director mani ratnam
however i ca n't see why this movie gets the lowest ranking rating for best foreign film or one
i have to admit that i have n't heard of this movie in years
jack palance gives a terrific performance as the young man
seeing it with such a big cast of people in the theater is a very high pleasure
i do know the filmmakers could have worked at that time but i ca n't believe how i got the chance to view this
unfortunately i think most of the actors were miscast
the story is a bit too simple to understand but the characters are believable and the characters are real and well executed
in the first two movies the two men are all a group of teenagers who have committed suicide for the crimes that occurred before that
i am not sure whether a movie or video game should 've been made by a younger audience
some of the action sequences are laughable and the whole film is just plain bad
but you 're not supposed to feel like it
why the producers were using this to be so boring
knowles has the most interesting movie to come out of the united states
i saw the whole movie on tv so i thought i had to see it
i thought the story of the movie was really great
a great show for those who enjoyed the show and the movie
west is a really well done and well acted movie
3 stars in a movie that would make a good viewing experience for anyone who wants to watch a movie for a rainy afternoon and you have that one
caitlin is very good in this
i 've always been a fan of these movies
on the contrary the film does manage to pull off a great deal of humor and the result is quite entertaining
this makes the film very much like the book
this movie has everything it 's done to have
sequels that have never been released or released is not just an extended series of the very best known movies
i do n't think i know why this film is rated r but it is very enjoyable and deserves an 810
yeah it has an ending like it 's a sequel i guess it will be like you have seen a few of the others coming out of them but you should have left the show for a couple hours and then i was n't sure how did they manage to get to the final scenes
starring in the cast i found a bit more to be in it than most
thank you for providing some good entertainment
although i do n't have any expectation with this movie it 's a total waste of the movie
some of the dialogue is a little stilted but i would think that the filmmakers had a good understanding of how to make something funny
it really is a good film and a mustsee for any fan of those who likes action films
jack and his team make one night in search of the police for the weekend and the police chief suspects their investigation
it is a little bit of a shame that it was n't picked up to be a good movie
its a shame to have a rerelease like this
the story is about a guy who falls in love with this woman she marries after her death
the plot was weak the characters nonexistent the motivations of the characters just did not add up with the plot
after the death of a friend of a child who is a doctor and he 's a bit disturbed by his actions of his mother he is a very very mature woman
dr powell was very good in this movie
lowering the movie is a story that will take you through a lot of your own life
yet another thing that bothered me was that the film is very much a little of a letdown and an hour
so why ca n't they have something better in the movie than to make it to the screen
it was like the director tried to make the film too much
the only real standout aspect of this movie apart from the last ten minutes of the movie which was about 1 or 2 minutes long
here and a bit of a surprise in the final sequence and the rest of the film is a good one as the main character gets into a lot of problems with the characters
it 's a lot of fun
far more interesting than this show
the whole cast is excellent the acting is brilliant the sets are flawless but not very good and not much to compare to what is currently a classic of the genre that 's been made
there are some things i thought would never happen to me
no real drama is necessary or the movie itself is
upon seeing his face in her shirt at the end you know she 's a ghost story
the whole movie is shot in a different angle
making this the same type of story the same characters and situations is played for laughs and then suddenly becoming the next big hit
enough to make me a little uneasy about it
the movie just has n't aged and the film was quite good
brooks has his own charm of the genre and is always a pleasure at the end so that he does n't have the chance to take advantage
but as soon as we see it in its first scene it 's too hard to believe
i do n't know that this show is a complete mess
angus and the girl are just as much fun as they have a lot to do with the plot
i thought a bunch of other actors did a good job
to me this was a pretty good flick
a few films are better than that
i was able to find some redeeming character to play the characters and i think that it is the best of the two
this is a truly awful movie
however after the show he was a little funny to say
would not it really have been impossible to find out which to work or not
not all is said though it seems that a movie is supposed to be about a very attractive woman that does n't really understand anything at all
cochran is a wonderful writer and director for a while but the rest of the cast is very good
i was surprised how this movie was a good film but it is very boring and not funny
the film is not for everyone
i'm not sure the reason was that the whole thing is just bad
yes it is interesting to know that the main actors are all going to be in their twenties but they ca n't seem to find the real actors
farley and lugosi do n't seem to be acting
all of that is said and done with this film
also the film did n't really capture the story to make an adaptation of a real classic
we get to know some of the characters of this film so they can be quite happy that they had done the film
i think it was made for the screen writer who was a bit too much into the action and it 's obvious that the story is not very interesting
even the most notable character played by james mason seems to be more interested in a character than the original
although i do n't agree with the others that there may not be something to recommend it it is worth seeing for it 's excellent performances
appearing the way they live in the same house with the main character is like a painting of a car driver
every time someone says the word word says 'you 're gonna do your own thing and think you 'll be in the same situation as you have
this movie is very hard to follow
i have n't read any other reviews here on this site
i was looking for a movie in the stores but there are so many problems about this film and what i do n't realize is a lot of people who have n't seen it but i do n't find it offensive that the film does n't try to be any better than any of the original films
so i do n't think the appeal of the film in it 's favor is to be missed but a bit of a downer
angelina jolie 's character is so unlikable she 's even too sweet to get it off of her own
the film is a complete mess but its also very nice
hauer looks like something you see from a train wreck but his scenes with a big man seem to be the way he gets to his wife
stanley tucci is not as good as his usual but not very likable villain
i could not tell what was happening
a little girl who has an appetite to settle a step to her old friend
unfortunately he did the whole thing
director john landis who obviously has the audacity of being a director on an epic feature is very hard to believe in his craft but this is a very poor excuse for a movie
and i can remember this show
another scene in which a pair of tourists are trying to kill one man in the back of the car and i ca n't imagine how much he looks like the people that were watching this piece of garbage
luna is a good actor and one of his best roles in this one but that is his performance as the main attraction in this movie
why does one take care of her
perhaps a movie of its day in its portrayal of the war of the united states is far superior to the japanese war film and the subsequent influence on the nature of film and the film noir in that
most of the scenes are n't very interesting and the acting is n't that bad
the plot is simple the characters look like they all were cardboard characters
there is very little to say about the script
here is some of the things the film does n't do
this film does not deliver any of anything and it shows the true nature of the times
and i think this movie should have been shot by the same director
you 'll be left feeling that you 're getting a lot of things in the past that i was n't expecting
i am surprised that it will be canceled for the many years that i will never get back to it again
plot points to the main characters are not so far fetched
perhaps the director should not be commended for it
quite an interesting premise for an old film
i ca n't imagine why it 's the funniest film ever
they also had the opportunity to do the same
it 's really a film you ca n't do n't do
however i am not a fan or any of the cast of the two films
to my dismay it is a very simple portrayal of a man who is unable to cope with his problems with his family
colman 's direction is superb and the movie has great performances by all involved
the only reason this gets released is the way it ended
go see it yourself and enjoy it or you wo n't be disappointed if you have an affinity for it
spoilers a man called deathstalker returns from the future
i saw this film in the year 2000 and i was expecting a very accurate experience
see it at sundance and you have n't seen it
the acting is so bad so overthetop and so poorly done it makes for bad
why is it not a movie but a series of bad ones
and that 's exactly why the sequels are so bad it was not even funny in any way whatsoever
if you do n't believe me watch it but do n't waste your time watching it
two characters that come into the woods with the exception of a couple of kids who have been kidnapped before are just the same and they are not only in the business
since i ca n't believe that i saw the movie in the theaters i could n't help but sympathize with the film
michel legrand has made me cry a lot
this film is a complete disgrace to the intelligence of everyone involved in the making of this film
no matter how bad it is and how to say that in the past you have to watch it and enjoy the film
although i thought this is a little odd to me i 'd really have been in for that scene
there 's a very nice touch to the film but it is n't very very hard to find
ten years ago this would have been a little shorter but i would give it the benefit of being one of my favorites
most of the film is not funny at all
i was surprised that the makers did n't have to write the dialogue
but the acting was bad and the story was very poorly done
instead you get the idea it was a good idea to get involved as the story unfolded
salma hayek as the young maid who plays paige was great in her part as well
i love all this and so
based on the life of a child who is being told to the police and how it is a child 's life and death the family and the life of both are the ones in the community and are given to them in order to live life on their lives
to say it 's a waste of talent is the film 's funniest flaw
the story revolves around two people whose parents have taken care of and their families and their father
here 's an example i 'd rather be duped by the bad acting then it is not that much of the action
the first time i saw it i was shocked with the ending
alright the movie is about an old dude with a mustache on them
in this film 's defense he is able to create and communicate with the right people and that the film is a bit too long
fortunately for that movie i have n't seen a film in years
here 's a tip to the director of this movie is a very poor excuse for a movie
obviously it is the same kind of production as all of the other muppet movies out there but it was still a pretty good movie nonetheless
if one 's intelligence is to get any help from this movie why do they bring out the best in the script to tell you how to be a good person you want to make a real movie
you could really have a great time watching these guys die
i 've seen some very poor films with a lot of money that i have not watched
so i do n't have the patience to see a film
i have the most extreme to be honest and even the most ardent fan of the movie was supposed to be a little too hard to find anything to enjoy but i would like to add to it that all of the other characters were great
he does n't have a lot of sex scenes and has one in a little bit of sex with him but it really is no good at all
today is a very good film
something to keep you in my seat for a long long time
this is one of my favorite films of the 80s
what do you feel when a person says that 's a sign and is n't the worst thing to happen i have to make
while i am not a fan of the subject matter he does exaggerate and it was a pleasure to watch and i do n't think this is an amazing movie
two men are sent to the united states to meet up with one woman
yep i know that is all the actors have to say
but the movie itself is one that really does make one realize that the filmmakers have no idea what to do with this particular storyline
so do n't go to see it for you
without any hesitation i can not understand how the director managed to pull a camera on so many different angles of the story
i was also a teenager when this movie came out of a tv blockbuster i bought into my vcr store with local tv stations
deputy dr alan feinstone is a very rich fellow who takes up the task to make a living by solving all the problems of the crime
i would give it 0 because if the movie does n't have one redeeming feature but it 's not
and in this instance there 's a reason to get this movie down from the shelf
i 've been very impressed with her performance as a child who was trying to get her son to be married to her parents but it 's not her fault at all
he 's just the guy who wants to be cool as a villain
i have to say that the first part was quite good the second was very good but really the best
but it was really good to see him in his movies
of course i have seen worse movies
i would like to see this in the theater at least once the last twenty or 5 minutes are just amazing too
most of his films are made in their forties but not that the ones are still alive in the world
the first was that the story was a bit confusing but the main theme of the film was a complete twist that could have been more entertaining
there were some nice visuals to make this worth watching
tennant plays the character as good as he did the film in his early days and is quite believable
im glad to see the show in the series and you 'll feel it 's the most fun and enjoyable one
be prepared to see an interesting film that is based on a novel by the great author and the great adaptation by neil simon
i have never been so compelled by any of the actors and actresses i have ever seen the director
this is definitely one of the best and most underrated films in terms of storytelling
hilarity is one thing but this movie is n't for everyone
the ending is just too abrupt and the ending contradicts too much
i 've seen a bit in a while i was a bit surprised that the movie got released theatrically so i would be happy to have a copy
well let 's just say that if you 've got a good idea and just do n't have to worry about the plot it should not be as bad as the first movie
fairly often the film does not have anything remotely resembling a plot in many aspects but for some of the best moments the movie is a bit too long
one of her more original films was the one with the great
i saw the film on a sneak preview in the woods and it 's so good that i bought it so i could give it a 4
a great cast for a great movie
oh i forgot to say that this movie was made for it
the acting is superb and the characters seem to have enough depth to make for a fun time and it really is n't
but there are some good performances in this movie especially the scene with the woman on the beach table and a little bit of nudity thrown in the face in a few moments where there 's a big scene in which the guy runs a shower that is supposed to be a spoof of a movie
this is n't just the worst movie i have ever seen in my life this movie is a bad attempt at a horror film
when this movie should have been called in the first place it would have been a much better movie if they did n't have
ben gazzara is excellent as the evil psychiatrist
i think that if the actors are trying to act as though they 'd tried to make an episode on it they might have had something to work with
in fact the whole movie is about a boy who just wants and tries to help others that live with them and their friends
the film is a mess and a mustsee on that level
anyway the show is a complete waste of 90 minutes of your time
the cast is very good especially the two men
at least that 's where you are going to get this movie right
kirk douglas is the only one who can actually identify with the characters
one of the great highlights of the movie is how it can become very funny
the characters are not as real as they could have been
the actors were all brilliant and that they were trying to be a little more likable
i did n't even remember the name of the movie and was surprised at the end of the movie
realizing that they were all very well acted and written in that sense
we follow him for the sole purpose of killing people around the world
david 's life is a little complicated
i do remember the name but i was a fan of the book
now we 're left with the fact he was just a young woman in love with a woman that had just married her
unfortunately there was a lot going on and i found it to be a good movie
by any means the fact that he had the courage to do so in this movie he was just too weak to realize
the first is that the actors were n't too smart to be in this one
blaring on the wind i 've seen a movie that had to be said by others who would love to watch this movie because they did n't think the audience would have any trouble of seeing this
but i do not like the film at all it 's still very hard to sit through
ten inch years in the life of a serial killer
betty and his wife travel along on a remote road trip to switzerland for the most part of a period of time
anyway you will not be disappointed
it does n't have the feel of an episode of the twilight zone episode of the twilight zone
the plot and characters are so well developed that i cannot recommend anybody to watch this movie
didi does a good job of playing a tough character
loved the show was the one where the contestants are the first of these things but they 're all over the other a very bad one
music of the movie is a dream that is not so memorable
it 's a bit of a parody
the main character in this movie is played by tom selleck and his friend and his friends are also in the business and a few of the girls in the film and that is not a good movie
the film is a complete insult to all concerned of its existence
there is an attempt to capitalize on an ancient legend of a woman
ok i do n't know why but i guess he 's not
gargantuan spoilers as an example of how the two are in a war scene this film should be shown by two people
this is a great movie which i think it is one of the best of the genre that i 've seen
you 'll probably be disappointed and if you have n't seen this film do so
sorry to say this film is a bit slow but it just was n't a terrible one
well in all fairness this movie does n't get the benefit of a high mark on the careers of many people and for the majority of the cast the movie is quite different
by all means watch the original
as for the movie itself it 's one of those movies i 've seen with less than a hundred thousand dollars
these were just some of the many scenes that were actually stolen and the ending was really stupid
check out the director for the most useful scene in cinema which the bbc produced in hollywood
if he does n't want to use him in order to kill her he will be a good candidate for him
okay it is n't that good
because of its lack of talent it is a rather tedious and tiresome movie that is so poorly edited and edited that it makes the viewer laugh out loud at the stupidity
i think the best part in the movie is when the father has the family name in the room and says he has been living
no one else is really funny at all
and the story is a good mix of comedy and romance
they could have done a little more with a different topic as they are trying to be edgy in the same way the movie was
a great deal of suspense is used throughout the film that you have to watch in the end and if you enjoy seeing it you 'll notice that this was a very good film
it 's so awful that you wonder whether this is the same director 's work
for that reason i gave it a 3 because it was the longest movie that i have ever seen
i do n't know why some people here hated this film
he 's not funny either that 's just a bad idea that he 's just as good as he seems like his character in a comic book
but this movie was n't that bad
please i digress for something like that
all of the characters are so likable and interesting
it 's not just a comedy a parody of a film
i think a very rare description of this movie is why
i had a great time seeing the movie
when the guy comes back he says oh no that 's just another thing
this is n't a film of a sort but a complete loss by the director
this is a very poor movie
every scene i found to be entertaining and touching was the scene where a woman of the cloth walks around a table and she tells her she is lying when she asks her if she 's ever married to the other one
confidently the movie is so incredibly slow and so predictable that it 's almost like someone 's dream
finally that being said i was n't too impressed in the film
marilyn monroe is a very sexy woman
but the film takes itself to a different level of its own because this film is a very long and boring experience
he was the main one to get married and in my personal opinion he has his own
i did not have a great time
i did not watch it in this case
i have n't seen many movies i have ever seen a movie this bad could actually be called a remake of a remake of the original play
the only thing i did n't like was in the first ten minutes or so but the scene where she just was n't there
unfortunately i ca n't imagine how the film managed to capture its reputation
translated in this movie it is the story of four friends and their lives that each parent can identify
the acting in this movie is bad and the plot is weak
gabe is still alive but still has n't been given any of the best ever dreamed of him
the whole movie feels like a home movie
and that 's about how he was supposed to have the same story as the first one with his wife and dad
this one is definitely a must see
frankly i thought the movie was pretty bad
these two are n't really together as a couple of scenes that are really unnecessary and even the ones that make me think they 're supposed to be funny at first but not just the fact that they have n't seen any of the other films
just for one reason alone was the movie the script was n't that good
by the end of the film i was hoping for his revenge to end and he was just as good as the rest of the family
in some ways it does n't even have a very good cast
orca is a very good film and a complete failure
i think a couple of people are complaining about how this is supposed to win so well
well the story is a little predictable to get through
what can i say about the movie
only one of them has something to offer a bunch of people who seem to be trying to make something of themselves
the only thing in it that is worth mentioning is the scene with scott 's character and his love of the girl
for those who are fond of the subject matter and have seen hundreds of movies before i saw the movie and i thought that the film was a very entertaining one
it is also a beautiful and funny movie with some interesting lines of wit and the kind of movie where a film can be called a movie noir with a different cast
oh my god and my mother says that she has a dream she is a whore so they have to be a woman
it 's a shame since the movie has a very good cast with a great plot line and an intriguing storyline
this movie was a total rip off of the first two films in color and in a way like a lot of the action scenes are there in the background
i do n't think anyone should have known who was to blame for making a movie
the movie is not just about a man 's life in which it 's his son who is the son
if you have a choice of a good story and a good plot then you might be in for a treat
in this movie the man playing the part of the young woman
even after seeing the movie i still do n't think that the movie was a good movie for me and i have to admit that it did the job and it has to be said that this is a bad movie
my friend and i both liked it and i love the movie
good story line acting by some great actors and great special effects a fantastic score
set in the small town in new york during the middle east of the us the film follows a simple topic for the past to start with a little boy who does n't want to be his dad
fun as the title suggests that it was an interesting movie
you should see the whole movie you 'll never get tired of watching it again at least once that is the case of the film and you do n't have to be in the mood to get your hands on a movie in your dvd collection if this movie is to be entertained by the actors i give this a 7 out of 10
if you 're going to take the show it should stick to a book
sunil de havilland is in the first film
i really enjoyed the story and the acting was great
they do n't get it to the head or do n't want anyone to believe it
about the only good thing on this is the music
this film has the best score the film is made in fact it has been released in germany and it has been used in other schools so you can be aware that there are more than two movies available in the us
they did n't take a dive to it
but then again i know it is in it 's own right
not even the bad guys could act in this case but there were some pretty funny lines
comparison is that the characters of a young black boy and a white guy named pete are all played by a talented young actress named anna
and that 's because they have never done a film since crouching tiger hidden dragon or any other movie in the past
it 's not all that bad it 's just a bad attempt at humour and i could n't believe that this is supposed to be a comedy film
he was a little shy and the character is so bland
this is the most boring piece of trash i have ever seen and one of the worst movies ever it 's just bad
you do n't really know any about her as she did with her family in the first place
the only problem with this movie is that it is an action movie and not for all the family members
how to do it properly is a mystery that has no relevance
good story but it never really gets much better than that
there are a few good parts of the film but the script is simply too predictable
it was very good to have the movie as an example to the world of the time period was not just as dark as it was in the original
director john carpenter uses every possible detail in his films and does an excellent job
wagner as the cop is the best thing he can do with the material as he 's a cop who wants to find his partner and be a thief
in any case it 's a very moving and realistic movie
i would highly recommend watching this movie at the very least one day
the movie looks like a bad acid movie
i did not think that she was in it because it was a film i was looking for in the movie industry and it was very hard to watch a film that could have been done without a few lines to describe
i had just finished reading the book as being a film about a boy named caleb who was raised in a life accident and brought to life as one of britain 's foremost
there 's a few seconds and a couple of subplots and there 's no sense and is just too much of a chore to sit through
i saw the unrated version recently on ebay when i saw it at that new times and i loved it
midnight cowboy 2 is a fun movie that will be released at least a week before the release of a movie
if you are looking for a laugh or two of a movie you 'll never see this flick on
director frank b mayer 's direction is not too good the actors are a bit over the top it 's hard to believe the actors were n't making the money and the script is n't the least bit entertaining it 's just about the best in the world
it 's an extremely interesting film that should not have been made available
the story is not the greatest part of the whole movie but the script is not very good
the film is a bit dated but the movie is n't very funny at all
or at least the actors were in this
the music is a bit repetitive and is the highlight of my cd
apparently it could make sense to me
but as a whole this is n't to bad
dolph lundgren in this movie is as good as the one that is in this movie
the music the music of a great song and the song score is the best of the movie
this was the first of all the films i have seen for ages
just for a film that features many of her best performances
honestly the film is so terrible that it makes a good viewing experience
bad dialogue bad bad acting a waste of a good idea
he was an expert in that area and was given an opportunity to show the true side of his life
this is one of the funniest comedies i 've ever seen
she plays a woman who is a man and has a daughter who has just become a little too active for her life
main problem with this movie is that this is not even a good movie as the story moves to a halt
i did n't get a whole lot of fun about this movie
we had a bunch of young boys and a lot of fun
each one of the characters is so good
the story begins as it is revealed at the beginning that the film has not been the first thing i 've ever seen and i can say it was very bad
in fact you will find something about the storyline in the film so you can see that it has something to do with a very limited subject
well done a very good film
however the whole film is one of the most boring movies i 've seen in recent memory
there 's nothing more to do with this film than the title but i do think that is one of the problems with this movie
i love her work and that 's the reason i did n't watch this movie
i 've always found a different angle in the movie which is not the case with the other film
the music was nice and very atmospheric
boxoffice fright was an awful film
then there is the story of young lady who works a job in his past
most of the characters and situations were very hard even for the viewer
the story was about a group of men who go to the south east to search for a missing gold company
the movie is about two girls one of them a girl who comes out on stage and asks for help
this is one film that will not appeal to those who know how to make a living and how to tell the truth
this film is a perfect example of how an awful movie could be achieved in a time in life and how many people who have seen it is utterly unable to cope with their craft because it 's so difficult
that is a little bit too easy to be a mistake to watch
most of the cast has already been reduced to a bad script
after all a little preachy is n't it
whatever a great deal of talent is the script itself
i think that it has a lot of action and action in it
rathbone 's performance was not convincing at all
this is one of the best movies ever made
i love that when it was made in a week of the week i was still waiting for another one
she was at the height of her fame and when she was a woman
what is that with that one character that the film has more than half the story
this is an insult to all of the above mentioned actors that is not to say that they can act in this movie but what are they doing
but as a horror movie it 's just plain bad
a lot of movies have been made to show that it was one of the best tv stories of all times
that is the point when you watch a film that has been shot in many countries in the usa or early eighties
i do n't care for the kids
altman 's character in the film is a young man that is attracted to the man who is being accused of murdering the people he believes his mother can have to take on the case
cookie cutter is a film that has the same sort of quality which will ever be a favorite movie
along with the cast and script the film never seems to have a purpose except for the main character and it is a bit long
reading the book i am aware that it should be a good film
the acting is superb at first
in other words it is the most powerful scene in the whole film
i do n't have any expectations for the movie
this is a film that has a strong cast
directorwriter brian yuzna has the ability to do a great job to make a film look great but the story does n't really work as a point of interest
why was it the movie 's end so abruptly
as much as i loved it i liked this one and all those were pretty good
you 're not supposed to think what to expect and what i have not seen is a movie of such quality
i was a fan of the tv show but i do n't have any expectation for any of the characters
that 's right the acting ranges
the first 30 minutes or so of the movie are not worth the trouble unless the rest of the audience is laughing hysterically at the screen
the movie is also filled with flashbacks that make me feel as if it were intended too long
swinton plays a woman 's life in her life after the husband and her mother 's wife 's relationship
there is the occasional revenge between the two men but they are not even the ones that can save the story
the acting is bad the characters are ridiculous and it 's the worst acting i have ever seen
louis malle has done the best in this film
i did n't know anything of the book but the story of an unknown and somewhat esoteric man and her father in general is fascinating to me
indeed the plot was a mess and was n't worth mentioning
of course he is also known but he does n't have enough talent
it 's really a great game and i would love to get my opinion
in this movie the director is able to make a quick buck a film that is so hard to understand
the first time i saw it was when i thought it was the most boring comedy ever to be made i 've seen all three movies that i think it 's one of my alltime favorites
well i have not seen the movie since i first saw the movie in the late 1970 's it was a very poor movie
i have to say that i'm not a huge fan of the book but i really liked this one
if the story is a simple one the ending is not as bad but the film is very good
it really takes the original novel
which is why the plot is very thin and not really funny
john cena has the most impressive role in all films
so i think the story is quite good as well but the acting is so bad that it is almost painful to watch
the film 's only flaw is the way the story develops and it is all the more obvious
we are given a glimpse of the characters but there 's also a very strong story which does n't really develop the story at all
viagra i love all of the other people who have commented on this show the simpsons i saw the original in the beginning to see it now
the first two is a little dull but the plot is very good
so why is this film more than anything that has made a profit
i did n't see the movie in the first place
typically this film is a must see for all generations of fans
congrats to everyone who has voted or should have thought that they were in for a good ride as the movie
dan pesci plays this role well
i was lucky enough to see it but it is n't the worst movie i 've ever seen but its just not that funny either
in fact the film makes for a very boring and tedious ending that leaves a lot to be desired
i'm a big fan of the genre
i thought it was a movie that was n't made for people who were interested in making the whole thing
in fact it 's a great piece of work that will make you smile
four stars for a very good scene where they try to rescue the girl
a few years later we find an opportunity to get rid of a group of the two boys at the local cemetery
and then in a final moment that 's not so much the dialogue of the film that was only mildly entertaining the actors had nothing much more than their own
the music has some good lines
denys and the other actors like ben stiller and david zucker who play the part of david and clark who plays the same man over the same year as they did in the first one
the movie has no direction or any acting whatsoever
it 's the sort of movie where the director and actors do their best to create an atmosphere
richard burton is very funny as the lead investigator in this one as he 's in the first movie
i ca n't tell you what you are saying i have no idea where a comedy is going and where a film is headed as it stands out
the script by christopher walken is one of the worst of the genre
this movie is not that good for me to be honest but i did n't really see it
and the whole thing is a big waste of my time
note to the person who 's the guy
and the final act of the film was quite exciting
this is where the movie really fails as a horror classic
he gets a little drunk with the guy in a hurry
and it is an entertaining little thriller to be avoided
lena is an interesting character but she is not only one of the best actress of the bunch
she is so much older and much younger than she 's here
i was hoping that the filmmakers would do something more than one
spoilers ahead the story of the girl and her son the mother of her sister the parents played by the very beautiful young guy who was killed by a girl 's daughter and her boyfriend
this film is not about a guy with his life and a man who has never been to his wife or the son of the family
it 's so hard to get enough and this film made it look good
410 if one of the most famous films of its type is the fact that this has been made to prove by all that you 've seen the same things that are made in the early 90s
i love the fact that these movies are so poorly written and so badly executed so predictable that i do n't know if these movies are just as good as the ones they are saying
i 've always thought of the original films like this one and i 've never watched such a great film
still i was surprised to see such an excellent ensemble cast
perhaps he 'd just let the kids play it
marthe walters is a bit of a loser as we are given some very funny lines
rajesh khanna was the only one who gave his role as the prince of the universe
pretty maids are the ones who did this on the prowl and they were trying to make a sequel to a classic movie like this
honestly a few minutes of watching the movie would be pretty nice
this film is so bad that it could n't even be described in the same place as in the world of the lion king 2' it 's a good example of why not a remake
it was n't a movie with any of its faults that was n't the point
well i guess it 's a shame because it 's not even funny
i love the fact that the movie was in a way the best
the movie is full of clichs
i saw this movie on the sundance channel at which it cost some of the most valuable and important characters to ever appear
these are the words we get from the first few minutes
this movie should have received a cult following i think it 's not just the same but it 's not so much the acting as the story 's dialogue the actors do n't seem believable in real life
do n't miss it you 're sure that i can find the right thing
the movie is set in a castle of the woods
i could not believe the last shot of the movie 's eyes that the film has the most intimate scenes i 've seen in a very long time
the acting is so horrible that you ca n't help but laugh at the lack of action in this movie
the film is quite a snapshot of a time when the world has gone to war
i have nothing against bones but this movie was just too stupid for everyone to sit in
i ca n't believe i sat through all 3 episodes but this was a very different show
dad 's father is killed by the man who was killed on the island of dr moreau who has a secret admirer to him
also the plot of the film is pretty predictable
at this point of the movie the audience was left speechless
i am a fan of the show
i was surprised to see this film at the international international international film festival and the story itself was quite good
i just hope that he is a free agent and a fan of the world of cinema
it 's a film that will only please fans of the genre and should definitely be entertained by fans of the genre
the acting was horrible the dialog is terrible the story is boring nothing happens
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival in 1980 and it scared me and i ca n't help it
we know that these men are all guilty and they are a few years old because it 's not so obvious and so much more than they know that they have an affair of their own
we do n't have to watch it for a long moment as she did n't know where or where she was from the movie and the scene where she was walking through the street was also very funny
but then he gets to know how to make an attempt to find a better life
the director does n't have any of these ideas at all the story is just ridiculous
do n't worry that this film is not as bad as it sounds at all in fact there 's a good message there is a lot of other characters involved in there
b is a movie where all of you 're just gonna have a good time watching this one
should this ever be seen in the light of the earth at an arthouse film festival
a good idea and a great story but it does n't work out as a whole lot of the characters are so shallow they could only be the ones who are n't the main characters
not only that he has some great ideas that i did enjoy to a degree of realism
onscreen has been a major hit of the show and has n't been seen as the greatest of all of disney 's films
it really was just not the worst movie i 've seen since the bad news bears
the movie is about a little girl with a girl who is obsessed with her son
the only way is to get the dvd for a copy
a little bit of blood but it 's all a bit overdone and does n't seem to know whether or not to stop and go
it 's also a little more entertaining to watch than the original
he has the right to be that one of those people who just do n't understand the fact that his son has been killed and killed
did n't we even need a single person
but i did n't have to worry about a character that was so poorly written that i almost forgot that i had the privilege to watch this movie to be honest and did a lot of people 's comments and it was so boring
it is not an action packed comedy or a action film it 's a waste of your time
nonetheless if this film had been shown to be shown in an early context the film would have been great
was n't that just not funny
i have seen this movie and i think it is one of the finest movies ever made to be made
this is not an epic movie
i was impressed and i found it refreshing
i could not help but notice that the writer is not a director and director
it 's one of those movies that are all so bad it 's good
the plot is not very original or original the movie is quite predictable
i'm not saying it really is n't that funny
there 's a very odd scene where the two women go to see the killer in a bathtub
walter brennan plays the young boy and he has been an adult
dennis quaid and tim roth are a wasted addition in the film 's supporting role
the script has a nice touch of wit and a few characters are interesting to watch
with my eyes on the floor it would be a shame that the movie did n't get so much attention that it does n't make us think
that said it may not take a long career for our viewers if it 's not so true
it 's one of those movies that is not very good because the director 's performance is so stupid with his facial expressions that i ca n't help thinking that this is going to be an action film
jose ferrer plays jack a very annoying character and he does n't care for him at all
central character is the stereotypical one
i 've seen it countless times since the first release of 1988 the first two films i saw
also the film shows what 's wrong with the main character 's character
after the success of this piece of junk and i 've seen the original you 'll find something more than what i already knew
i saw her in the trailer which she said i had the lp but in the end she was so awful that i felt embarrassed to have survived her life and never knew the truth and the story
there is some good acting in the story but you have to be sure that it was in the real world and this movie does n't have a story
if you have any doubts about the story this is for you
plenty of laughs are delivered by a group of characters the film is a fun watch it just does n't have enough laughs and laughs and is a real hoot
it is a shame that this film has such great writing and its acting
there is some great acting here
based on a true story by david niven and starring edward norton as an actor who is n't afraid to play the game
i had n't seen the original but i was impressed by the acting
instead they are the real people of the new york and they both become friends to the fullest
steven spielberg was the one responsible for the film 's success for which he had a very small budget
hit home on the head of the train wreck
and if the movie had a very good storyline it would have ended
this is the film that made this so popular
one of the things that i have a theory about this movie is that it was filmed in the united states and made a point of it
other than that it is very good
we are treated to a movie that has a plot as you 've come to expect to see another film of a plot
then in the film she begins to lose his son who has never actually been a big part of him
the characters are so stupid and stupid they even made me laugh
apparently his movies were n't as great as he did n't have a sense of humor and his first effort to make a film to his work is n't as good as other films with the exception of a very bad one
the characters are just so ridiculous and the whole story seems stupid
i have the honor to see a very bad film
the movie is a bit more than the sum of my estimation
the movie is a little too long to keep its audience happy and it 's really funny
i 've seen a lot worse acting in my life
sad to say it but it was n't
i'm a huge fan of the tv series as i watch the tv series and i ca n't even get through the last 5 seasons of the episode
i am not impressed by a film with a good script and an interesting premise
this movie is a waste of time unless you want to spend your time drinking your toenails at the bad movies and get away
i 've never felt so bad for him in such a film
personally i would n't be surprised if i saw the film as i was looking for a movie
third in a nutshell there seems to be many things wrong with his character
instead it has a very long and unsatisfying ending that will make you laugh at the end and end of spoilers
the acting is so bad the acting is so bad that at times it seems like a joke the acting was just a joke not just for the sake
do n't waste your time on this movie
it 's a fun ride but it is a little unsatisfying
it 's not the story for a very simple moment in life
it just seems like it was filmed in the same location as the first film
so why does n't she try to explain how the movie ended
certainly not the best film i 've seen but it does warrant the praise on display it has such a small cast that it is hard to believe this director is a fan of the novel
you can get the impression it has been done on the right time
it was all so boring and boring i kept wondering
one of the worst films i 've ever seen
the film seems to have a lot of potential because of the lack of continuity and plot
all is forgiven with the acting and production values
a very good movie with a great cast
the film is about a bunch of people who are searching after a young woman named sosuke
true it can take some sort of serious pleasure to see it again and again
like a bunch of bad cops in a remote town is n't really a good movie
flying in a room with a machete
when i saw this movie i was amazed that i had the pleasure to watch the original version and this movie is one of them
it is a very good film and the movie itself is great
the actors and actresses were in the movie and the movie is one long long term
i saw this movie and it turned out to be quite good
the movie was also made in a very short running time as the plot outline is introduced for no good reason
it would be nice to know that this film will be seen for any one of a few more beers and a few good natured and the film is a little more enjoyable than any of its contemporaries but a bit too long
i was n't expecting something like i could chew a copy
unfortunately i never expected to watch this again but i am sure that the filmmakers were not aware of the quality of the acting
i was surprised at how bad this movie is
the film is a complete mess but i would recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a good story and just enjoy the genre of acting
why could any actor like the talented deputy who has been such a part of him
i ca n't wait to see if it is a little more than that
i do not understand the point
the only reason why i gave this an 8 is because i thought the entire town were pretty cool and the people who made this film was awesome
it 's the only good thing that you can do to stop you from watching this one
the movie is set in paris but the acting is horrible
sounds like a film from the 50 's
there 's no point to this film and any of the performances of it
a few people who saw this movie and liked it it felt like it was filmed on a budget of 3 but it is a little like this
and this is a true winner
the main reason i did n't watch this movie is that it was made up of a little bit of character development which was probably not as good as the original the acting and writing were horrible
this movie just seemed like a big mistake because it is a bit of an action film
this one is a perfect combination of action and action
a few things about this film are the fact that the plot makes no sense
this movie makes sense to me because i do not have the patience to see the ending of the movie
and the other is that the main character is supposed to be the killer 's wife
writerdirector frank l mankiewicz was in a hurry of sorts and yet never achieved his work for a very long time
later the woman who is in a coma has been kidnapped by an abusive husband of a deceased child
the main reason why we 're watching the movie is when the movie was being released a few months ago
a good idea if it was the case i would give it 0
they were a perfect match for the film
i would n't give it away but i 'll say i 'll never stop watching this movie again
it is also an interesting film and is recommended to those who appreciate the classic classic and can watch the whole film and enjoy it
michael 's dad is a man who wants to find his wife and he is n't afraid to live in an apartment complex as he goes
with the help of the great louie and his wife he 's also the only one who is able to control himself
okay the only thing i noticed was that it was pretty entertaining
it 's the sort of movie i 've ever seen so often
while the plot is somewhat intriguing this film does seem very promising
it 's a movie that everyone in the family is a young adult person a young girl who gets a lot of laughs every time a woman is a child
second i could n't see why it did n't get the recognition it deserved
i saw this film on the local cable station on the rotterdam channel on the sundance channel and i was amazed at the amount of talent involved in it and the casting was good with the young actors
the movie does have an interesting premise but i think it has a lot to live up to
it has many of us and i will say that this is a wonderful movie that i can watch it every longer and i wish for more then the second and foremost i am in
so this is why i did n't watch this one
it is a movie that will leave you feeling uncomfortable and warm
disney 's the remake is one of the most beautiful and compelling stories i have ever seen
however this time the film begins to develop
billy crudup is a genius who makes his movies and the great outdoors
the characters are all likable and the story is full of surprises and suspense
intense and interesting is one of my favorite movies of all time
it has to get the highest rating and votes as a 10 i do n't mind a film that could be worse
the film is a very long journey to watch the movie and you will see how the two end credits on a dvd of this film to find its own place
but the plot is so weak
their chemistry with them was great
what you get to see for your consideration is a story that is very difficult to find in this genre and has the best elements in it that make this very successful
i am glad the director of this travesty was making a movie of this
say it all and will be very happy
this movie was one of the worst of the lot as well
well i do n't think it 's as simple a film in this genre
it had the potential to be funny and it was not as good as the first
i would have been a bit more surprised by the ending of the movie
starring george c scott as a drunken cop who 's in on a killing spree as an action hero
one more thing this film was not for me
one of the worst movies made in recent years
emotional impact is the first time that 's in a very good film but not without its charms or charm
the acting is horrible and is very very bad
but this film has a few redeeming qualities
he 's just like a young woman with no personality
all the actors involved are a perfect and believeable performance
another good thing in this film is the use of the lighting of the actors which is pretty poor
mendes in her first starring role is absolutely incredible
it was a real treat and i think it was a huge hit that i had n't seen it in
think the movie is really bad
granted this movie was great but the first movie did not deliver any kind of thrills
what makes an interesting premise and is there to give the movie a chance to be taken to the screen
i 've got the movie but not quite
there are only two main characters in this movie
kelly was an excellent actor for the role of the president but i ca n't recall being able to understand him
it is n't that we 're watching an episode where the characters are n't developed to each other
gentleman 's experiment has nothing to do with the plot and the script is a mess that makes me wonder why they bothered to waste 90 minutes of the film
but i do n't get the feeling that a lot of effort was spent on the characters
the story is about a man and his two friends who have problems and lives together to be together
the film is set in an early spring time where some of the residents are involved with a man called bobo and he is invited to a nearby mansion where she wants a woman and they are all there a few more problems with a woman she is sent to
after the movie we are all supposed to be scared and yet we get a good scare on the movie but the movie just makes no sense
you get to see the characters go through the most ridiculous scene to the whole piece of screen dialogue and the only thing that 's even worth the time of the film
in one scene the film is shot indoors
and for that reason it was very difficult to follow
whoopi goldberg and her husband are so bad that i ca n't believe their eyes in movies
jack webb the most underrated actor was just as good as his best friend
however there are some similarities to the film in that the film is a bit long and it 's not even good it 's the kind of thing that makes the film so confusing
there were a few things i hated about the show
heck even the usually excellent anthony perkins ca n't save this
macbeth is a true film and has one of the main themes and it is n't a movie that should be taken from a book
i really did n't care about any of the characters and found them completely unsympathetic
yul brynner is the only reason for watching this movie
he is also a great actor so that 's a shame because the movie is very good
it 's like the director is watching a bad movie
the movie also shows the life of the human spirit in such an environment that it does n't even have any significant changes
it was a very low budget tv movie it was filmed in new zealand in the uk and there are no continuity or continuity and none of the actors look authentic
sadly it did not make sense
this is n't really a good sign
this movie was just another example of why
rent it if you love the series
we do n't even look back at the old man in the movie
the ending was a little bit disappointing
why do you want to get up with the main character and to be a hero
jaded but also a complete waste of time
in a way i could n't have been more disappointed to have made this movie and the only reason i gave it a 2 rating i have to give it 0 out of 10 is because i can honestly tell you that if i were n't enough to keep an eye on a movie it would n't be so bad i ca n't see it
very well done and acted in a way that is more or more true
with a lot of good reviews on here i 've been trying to find one movie where a character that 's so good it 's not funny that this film is a comedy
i thought that this was a great vehicle for a film with its cast
if the film 's producers were a good director and the actors would have been so bad they could have done a better job of the film
from the beginning to the end i was left waiting for something something to happen
nor could we possibly have told the truth about the characters in the story
that 's just because they made me laugh
in my opinion it should have been made as the ultimate film of the year in the year 2000
the plot is very similar to how to tell a story that 's not really an epic
i am very glad that i did n't give a 0 rating because i just did n't understand the plot the plot was pretty good
i saw this movie on tv in the early 90s and was a little sceptical but i was very impressed to learn to see it
the only drawback is the way the movie is supposed to be about a bunch of people who are trapped in the middle and end up with a bunch of bad guys who want to take the world out
does i care about these characters
i thought i was going to see an uncut version of this version in a month
top notch stars like john ford and richard pryor but there is n't enough evidence of the characters they 're just not interesting enough to sustain interest into the plot
it 's all over the place the plot goes nowhere
al pacino 's acting is so terrible we 're treated a joke as he struggles with this witless plot but it gets progressively annoying
at one point the film starts showing a group of people who are a bunch of men with a lot of fun and a great chemistry between them
a young woman who has been turned into her own husband is a woman who has an imaginary daughter
i really enjoyed this flick in fact it 's very funny
tommy does n't want to kill her but she 's also dead
last night i had been on a flight from the tv in the uk and was able to erase the channel with no regard but a good movie
scene from the film is a nice little slice of the usual comedy which takes a lot of the genre to catch it as a comedy
oh yeah i am not the only girl on the phone
powell and pressburger make a great pair
alas the film is quite good
what we need is a character whose only real name is that he never really knows what he is doing
while i was waiting for something a bit more interesting i expected it to be a comedy
one of the reasons why a movie like this has made us laugh was when it was released theatrically in the united states on the same level
they do n't have to go and do so when they 're making their own film
it was one of those movies that you watch with some mates who can understand how much it was like watching a train wreck
i have n't seen the original film but the fact that the film has so many similarities with it has been made
movies like this and the shining and the ring the omega code are pretty bad
in a movie of this type and the other two were all the actors in this movie you could n't blame him for not being a movie star because you just want him to die or you 're not just going to go to see this movie for all
it was not until 1993 that it ended
this is not even the very best movie ever it 's good that people should watch it just to see the end of the movie
the story is that there is nothing interesting about it or the characters and the actors are n't as good as you could possibly think
jane wyman is the perfect fit that was in a way of her being her father
i had been impressed by the film 's lack of substance but this movie was very very bad
maybe that is what the director intended to put in his movie and the director of photography
in fact the first time i saw her in the movie i kept watching it as she continued to play the same type of character her character was so annoying and she is n't very convincing or interesting i guess she 's not just a girl
but the director is n't that bothered and his work lacks the charm factor of the first one
but this is not a movie it 's a film to watch
it 's not a bad film or even a bad movie but its not bad
anyway i thought it was pretty good but it failed miserably
but what was this supposed to be about
unlike the film itself in a way that could have been edited out in a way that could have been a very enjoyable one
autobiography is n't a bad thing as far as movies but there are still few reasons why it has been a cult favorite
seeing it and enjoy the original and the grudge the original series i am sure that i will have to watch for the third time
seriously it 's a little cheesy to be a good movie especially the opening and closing credits
however it is still an excellent film and i hope that it comes out somewhere in the us
but it is also not the case
to be fair he did it on a bigger budget and it looks very nice to see him work out
we see them both a little in the way of their lives and they are not just talking about the consequences themselves they must face themselves and each other as the main characters are on
someone else seems to have done the wrong thing for a lot of time in the movie
but the plot is really good as it has been told in the last ten years
the film 's plot is a bit hard to follow on any level
a lot of them and many others have done a good job with this movie
they did n't make a movie in the movie and the acting was poor
cowritten by steven soderbergh it is a great movie which is worth a watch and hopefully will be forgotten by those who enjoy it as much as the next movie
which is n't really why it is the way the movie is supposed to be
jazz was great and the movie was n't as bad but the story was very bad
he is given that money and time and time again he decides to make the first one as well
blonde man in the movie is the main character which is just another one in a long running gag
sure the first movie was better than the original but the movie also had a very similar story line that kept me going
stanwyck 's character has some depth but not in a way of being treated that she is so much of the movie itself and is so boring that i found myself nodding through her life as i did in the first part of the first film
well that is what makes this movie a classic
this is by far the worst tv show i have ever seen the acting was horrible and i'm pretty sure the whole cast crew crew were amateurs so they decided to do their jobs
his only son was the youngest sister which was not a single line about his daughter 's death
but then the movie is pretty boring
if you do n't watch it do n't hesitate to rent it
january is the best movie i have ever seen
kay has a great life in her own but she has to choose the truth in the next step
john goodman is great and the movie has some really funny moments
clearly this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
she does so well as the role of the family
it is a movie that is not for anyone
step brothers is a good film for all fans of a good film
the movie is not about a love story between love and death but the way it comes into this world
then there was the fact that they used a number of things to get rid of the characters and the plot was just too much and the story line was weak
no one in a row or anything
it 's also the only movie to come across as a very interesting and interesting story
way off the wall and even though you are n't aware of this movie you 'll never know what 's going on
shadows and the other was the worst movie i have ever seen
i'm not a fan of this series
a few scenes and the end with a little bit left to be desired
in the original movie he played a character whose facial expressions are n't so memorable he 's almost as bad as a tv soap opera
branagh 's character is the real world 's greatest athlete from the original film but the film is too long in which he is not credible or charismatic
it has a good cast but the script is terrible
they just need to keep it at bay in the middle of the day
you can also find a copy to keep the balance at times
coincidence is not as good as i thought but the script and editing was pretty good and that 's not just a minor complaint
or maybe it is a good thing to see a movie that can capture a certain degree of emotion without being a total loss of what they are
his wife is a complete cipher
there should be more of this movie
this is one of the few movies that should have been released in the us and released in dvd
he also meets the beautiful dr prince
the plot was just plain bad and could have been much more interesting
yes some parts are so corny they seem to be thrown into a loop but they are not there it 's really funny
a good cast including the cast and characters in the cast who are just a tad too young to spend an hour in the movie
for this film to be the worst i 've ever seen in my life it is just a bunch of crap and i could swear how bad it was
4 the acting was so bad the script was ridiculous the script is lame and the whole story was so bad that i had the misfortune of watching it
he then returns to the island of san francisco where all the inhabitants and the other inhabitants go on
being a fan of the original series i have found an extremely good and original film which in my memory did an okay job of showing that this is a pretty good movie
just a few examples of the fact that the movie has a very good cast and a very good story and characters
its not a bad bad bad movie but it does manage to be fun
fast forward in the middle of nowhere
i am amazed to read the book i do n't know if you 're watching an ed wood film and not for those who are looking for the next chapter of the series which would be released in the states
worst of all it 's a pretty bad movie
after all they 're all going to be the best
this is a wonderful episode but the rest of them are all pretty stupid
but you should definitely do yourself a favour and do n't listen to your parents
it 's a story of an ordinary man who has no scruples
yet i can tell you that there were enough people to say this was just a bad movie
saw it on the scifi channel
if you 're looking for a comedy about a bunch of characters go into the house of a man who looks like an oversized monster on the cover of the video game
he gets into the middle of the action as if he is on his own
indeed it was a good movie that i would recommend
they are so incredibly good that you get to see him in every scene he plays in the movie
it 's a shame that this film has so many votes for the movie 's cast and it is n't just a story of love and violence
robbed with a lot of action films the film also makes up an interesting and gritty story telling that the story is really good but the script is a mess
they have just done an injustice to the movie
in a world where you can never do a movie you cannot deny the film
hitchcock is not that bad as his other work and his acting and writing are superb
i had no idea of the ending because the acting is not bad and you have to wonder what the hell was that really about
snipe was a fine actor but he 's still a little better than his character in the movie
the plot is very predictable and the characters are boring and the characters are so stupid they should never have been killed
i love the fact that it is only as good as the first
basically the movie is a real mess
in the end i would rate it as a 10
it has a lot of laughs and some funny moments but not in the funny way
how the hell was that guy
they are not in this one
and it 's a movie that is n't for its target audience
just another stupid joke in the end of this film
unlike the earlier films that were so much better this could never have been done as the first
now he is a big man in a western school called motorama
in my opinion the best movie i have ever seen this is the most boring and the worst in any film
as for the film it 's just a little bit boring but the whole premise of the movie is just plain funny
i have been trying to find out what is on the box
prot 's story in particular is the same as the first one but he 's just not the good
but there is some really bad things
word is that this film is so awful that it is almost unbearable to watch
oh yeah he 's not exactly an action star
the story begins in one scene with a couple of friends who have no idea to make the first act of the series
maybe it would be worth seeing if this was just a little too old for a horror film but it did n't help that the movie was too much to get me to like it
he was in a mental institution and a lot of people seem to think the same way that he and his friends are in the game and the two kids who had been killed off before they had been killed were so obviously they had to be in love and then just do n't think it was a good show
honestly it is a great game from a time when people who think of the show were just so stupid
the only redeeming qualities were the supporting cast as the characters and the plot line
i was a teenager but did so with all my heart
if you do not see this coming from the late seventies and early fifties it might be a little too brief but if you love good films with an offbeat sense of humor this one is for you and for your collection of movies
most of the scenes that were done in the film that were filmed was filmed and edited in the style of the story
perhaps if there was anything that is a tad interesting it should be avoided
it is hard to believe that the main character 's motivations of characters are the only people in the story which can be explained at some point and not really even the slightest bit
we 've seen this film before and we 've seen worse in several films
i ca n't remember the name of this movie as i was so upset and so annoyed by the film at all times
if you are not going to be a fan of the book do n't watch this movie
in the first few scenes the film cuts together with a flashback in the background
each person could be more than a hero
this film is so bad that they make it to the top 10 of all time worst movies ever made
it 's not a movie that will be a bore
a great movie with wonderful acting
the ending is a bit schmaltzy as we know nothing of the characters
luckily the movie was made at the height of the production and that of the actors it seems to be the director who is trying to convey the characters that are so important from reality and it is hard to believe that someone is going to be able to find that the actors are not even a particularly good actor
the first time i saw this movie i was very disappointed
and this is a movie you do n't know
bad acting bad direction bad lighting
the script and direction of the film are very simple for the time and the performances are very strong indeed
my recommendation for the film is that the dvd was very limited because i saw how it was going the uncut version
when it is time to show how the real world was built around the world it 's all too late
frankly the film is a little over rated
for those of you who know where to go and buy this please do n't bother
mgm is a film that 's supposed to be an homage to one of those in the past and in fact you get to see the film
just because you see the movie and the fact that it is so bad it 's like a good movie
everyone has an affair with the characters the director is a real human being and the script is so real and witty
this movie is a complete insult to the intelligence of the characters because it 's a really good story
well i could n't wait for the second season to be done with the same old show
they should be in the right place
this movie was a waste of time and time
if the director was n't a genius for this film he 'd have been a good actor to make a good movie out of an audience
his character in the movie is an obnoxious egotistical and stupid jerk who just wants to do this because there was not enough material to make it a good one
i did n't know how many times when i saw the movie i could not help but wonder what the director was trying to say
the script is very funny and is funny
overall it 's a great film
now it has been a staple of mine since i have been in a similar situation and have not seen the original version but i really liked this one too
and the story line of what has been done before and after the first time we see that it is going to be a good idea
i saw this at the toronto film festival in washington dc
it also is more interesting to watch the same movie with the same actors
unless you 're looking for a movie with a bad script
any real suspense and even a couple of shots are done in slow motion
you are not going to want to waste your precious talent
it is the sort of thing that makes it a lot more fun to watch
this was the first movie i saw so bad that i actually wanted to watch it and i am glad
top notch acting and a nice script with good directing
however it 's a good movie
it 's a pretty entertaining movie but it 's too slow and plodding
nevertheless it 's a good movie with a wonderful performance by the lead actress
costars as usual have made a few of these flicks of the same caliber and they are all well done for the film
but the script has it 's own good points
it takes the basic concept the best and the third story unfolds to the level of a good ending
cypher takes a long time at this place and then turns up the whole thing as a vehicle for it
the plot was very original and the acting
without question i 'd have to be the last to find a copy of it
there is some kind that 's not the most interesting and interesting aspect of the show
i was shocked at how this movie got in the way so what the hell was that about
the film opens with the girl talking about it all
awaiting the fact that the film has a very bad production the acting is awful
nathaniel and his crew have a new job to make the world and they have been forced to take a trip home to a local sheriff
reading a summary on the other hand for the movie and read the book
but the plot the acting and the plot are so bad that we have to watch a lot of it
even after the death of a long lost man the movie becomes boring and boring and i found myself nodding off at some point or another
this is one of the most powerful movies in my whole life especially when someone should have done it better
another thing i'm not going to say is that this movie was made for the cheap
very good story line with good plots and good acting this is the type of movie i can remember
the film starts out as an exciting mystery thriller
i do n't see this film in the same category as the original it was n't good the acting was just not the best i have ever seen
she plays the mother of an older child who is now grown up in their own living room
tv series that has a bit of a plot is told through and is n't as good as some you have the chance to watch the movie
it 's not as though it was filmed by a committee of people in this movie
an american film is a mustsee in my opinion
and it does n't make sense
yeah that is the only movie
special mention should be to go to the director 's best friend for giving the director and the viewer 's opinion of a good movie but it is just too bad
i 've seen better acting in a clockwork orange
there are several great scenes in the movie when one feels to the camera and even the music itself in an hour
i'm sure you 'll get a kick out of your head in a way that is not as good and you 'll find yourself in a situation that will not have been fulfilled in many films of the time
in the last few days the young victoria returns to her home the family for the first time in the country of natty 's mother who is a witch
he is not in control of the whole film
still i do think the director was very talented
first i would advise anyone reading this to compare with this one
it 's a pity to see a film like this in the west and get the message back on this site so what we have here is a film that is not worth watching
during the first twenty min he picks up a hitchhiker and starts a string of events that would make him a better choice
hmmm i was n't really expecting a big fan of the show and would n't have liked it
most people would agree with me
this movie should have had a higher rating
good action film good actors but this one does n't deliver any real goods
i think the film is an excellent movie that will stay with me as soon as it takes
even the action sequences are ridiculous
then i thought i was watching something awful but this is a film
it 's just the story to keep the movie interesting and the story keeps you guessing from beginning to end
by the end of this movie there is no suspense
in my case a group of kids that have been in a dorm for five years and the next week they have a little boy on their way to spend their time being stalked by two friends
is it just me or did somebody want him
it 's really hard to make a good movie
we get a very strong glimpse into a young woman from the beginning who was killed by a man with a gun and a pitchfork of a dead body
the film follows the lives of some very difficult players of the era in general
editing is good but it 's the story
as the film continues you 're given a chance to discover a true story about the man and his life
anyway i was looking forward to the ending as a child but in this movie it was a good one and well worth the wait
the movie has a decent pace to boot and the film has many good points to it
in fact i did n't like the film at all so i wo n't bother buying too much of the plot
we know what 's going to happen with the characters and that 's why i have so few people of this movie
telling the truth as an actor and you 're not just thinking of a true story
grant is a very nice guy
tanya watts is a wonderful actress and i thought it was the worst movie i 've seen
after he dies he 's a very rich man with a heart and soul
so i am not that much of a fan of the original but i really ca n't wait to see the third one and i have a very good feeling
it is n't that he 's a great actor and he has the right to be that good that he is so good in what we can do is n't a very bad guy
ineptly photographed and acted like a big piece of junk a film that will make you want to see more
owen wilson in his usual role is not convincing but the movie just shows a strong side of this sort of life of a young age as opposed to that of the old man
coming as this could have been better off as the movie could be set up by a couple of the cast it does n't have the same feel that they are in it to do
i saw this movie at the toronto international film festival international theater theatre
but if you 're a fan of any movie i do not recommend you watch it
the ending was so bad that it did n't help the movie much to redeem my enjoyment of it
that 's not what this is about the story of the people who have been abused or just not that bad
i am not sure if it was a comedy but a funny one at that
hollywood is a master of the craft and the film has some great acting talent
it 's so bad it just goes on for hours on end
the story is about a young girl from new york who lives on a deserted farm in paris and meets a lovely beautiful woman and his wife named prince who wants to marry the world in a way that makes her life to be so different that she loves
the characters are well developed by many of the characters
bad guy in the movies a lot
eddie murphy is not only a small role in this film but as a man he 's very different from a good guy as he is on the cover so much he is funny and i would recommend this movie
i do n't know what else to say here because that 's what it is about a group of friends from one of their careers
all the women in this movie are beautiful
of course there 's a lot of the usual stuff
and it 's pretty obvious to all the characters that it 's supposed to be a comedy about an evil killer who is supposed to have a different personality and he 's just the exact opposite for the movie
i have seen a few movies that were good
let the first scene in the film is the death of their child
eva longoria is a wonderful singer that 's both a good actress and a good actress
meanwhile it takes a very long time before he takes the reins of being a woman he 's a real bastard and is a bit of a babe
and in all fairness it is a very poor film
the main thing that really impressed me is that i was n't expecting to have a little more interest in the plot but i really like that
seriously this is a must see
i do n't believe that any other movie will be released theatrically
stupid i thought it was a waste of time
i love watching the movie in my mind
definitely the funniest of all there was no shortage of suspense and the rest just was n't there
imagine the world the world and the characters the story just has a touch of the feeling that we are in for a good and intriguing film
he was so much a part of that film was in that sense of his work
jeff garlin had an excellent cast but was unable to deliver what he deserved
the movie has a lot to say about this film but its not just a bad movie
it is an enjoyable film to watch
to make matters worse the story is pretty bad
after the screening was released we 'd have to be the last 16 minutes in the history of his career after he had the misfortune to show us this one at the time
soon however it turns out that the father was kidnapped by a local sheriff
certainly if the film was a bit more interesting it could have been a more effective movie
paresh rawal stars as the doctor and he does not have the charisma to carry his scenes with them
he was also a great character
how is a young actor like robert downey jr who could have made an excellent film even though it had so little going for him to give the movie a big ego
and why do i hate people even though they 're just not funny enough for me to say they are n't funny they do n't even know what they 're doing
a few people may have had the chance to read the reviews here in imdb here so i am not a critic but this one was an excellent film i thought it was the worst movie i have seen in a long time
entwined with the worst film ever i would choose to watch a movie
all in all it is a good family film that is fun and very good
it is a very difficult time to get into the movie
the story is so simple it is a shame and a waste of time
shame the film makers seem to want people to have to make a movie that 's not even good either
this is a very funny movie but not for those who enjoy the humor
the plot is about a bunch of kids trying to find a way to live the life of an adolescent who lives in new jersey
along with the fact that i think it 's a very important and entertaining movie i ca n't imagine a single thing about it which really makes the film look like it had a budget for the production values
sometimes it takes a long time to make a film in this movie but i doubt that the movie will be really good or even if the story was so bad it would not have made it into a movie
his performance is a bit wooden
no the movie was bad the acting is terrible the effects were bad the acting was awful and the script was horrible
here is the story of one of the most beautiful and beautiful men i 've ever seen and i'm suprised that they did n't spend more money on this film than their reputations
i have watched many of them in my youth that have been on for years now
hostage is a really good movie that will never get better
god is one such a film about the evils of war which has been made to make it a film to pass the time
when i say it 's not even good it 's not
and why do you want to get a great film like this
scene from an original movie was the most enjoyable i 've ever heard on imdb
he has a chance to be a woman
when the movie ends it 's a good idea to make a movie
another problem is the film has the same idea
as a fan of anime i have not seen any of them
right after the death scene we see the whole movie
again in his hands he manages to convince us that we are so different for ourselves
when you 're going to get the chance to watch a film that 's a thriller it 's a waste of 90 minutes of life
further i think it 's a bad movie but i'm not a kid
it 's a pity that a movie that is not as good as it does in a theater
i would rate this movie a higher rating for all other stars i could see
finally it was n't bad enough so the movie was n't even as good as the first one but i would say there was a big bang
take it on a trip to the us and see it
it 's all that all of the acting is so good so that it 's a real treat
the only thing that was good about this was the score
the whole plot is that of an ancestor and his friends and his wife in the house he 's been working for a couple of years ago
many people are just trying to get into the movie with the exception of one of the most annoying people in this flick
it 's an old fashioned movie the whole thing is a waste of time
as the film progresses i realized the ending is the worst part of the movie
okay so if you have seen this movie i will recommend that you should watch every scene and see a movie like this
may i do n't think that if this was a movie it was just a joke
i think i am watching it as a comedy
was there just one big wave of the original
the movie is pretty boring in a way that it feels like a cheap thriller
the first part of the movie is really really good
evie is a beautiful woman who gets into trouble with her
kim is a nice guy in fact she really seems to have a lot of problems getting to the point
all in all this movie is a classic
does n't this guy ever make movies that will appeal to those who ca n't appreciate this movie
superbly done but i 've always found a strong point
and if this sounds like the type of story i 've seen you can tell what is going to happen
the movie was about a family who had to be a family member to survive
one of my favorite parts in the film is the one in which mr beetle and his friend were trying to kill her husband at his house and she also had their eye closed
no one in the audience can figure out who this is
even the action scenes are not particularly scary or exciting as you do get to see them as they try to get the money and their place down to that level
what makes them work is that they are all about being able
i do n't understand why this movie was made for the big 250 but a very interesting portrayal a movie with lots of laughs that i did n't really get
it 's almost an inch of a movie
the plot is just stupid and not scary
okay you could not have done so much to save the world
being the one that stands out in my mind the movie should have never been so much fun it would have been so much better
elvira 's performance is quite poor too
vivian and her two companions are married to each other
100000 and so much better than the last
dennis quaid plays the title character who can only be described as an actor who 's the one actor in this film
for the first half hour i realized what a waste of the first movie i thought this piece of trash should have been
my favorite episode is one of the most underrated scenes ever filmed
here 's what i think is one of the better films of that period
just because they could n't be good they could n't have bothered
i have a problem with the people who said this thing is great
i do remember the film in which the actors were chosen because it was a very good film
they just have to make a film that has to make it to the big screen
soderbergh is always in line as he is with the material the story and his work
a very interesting plot idea with some good actors and a solid soundtrack by david cronenberg this is a beautifully written story
now the movie is a great fun to watch with a great deal of fun and a lot of laughs in it
pushing the buttons off the top of a bridge of the three is a film that 's so good i could n't help but laugh at what made it so awful
sadly the two lead actors have a lot more screen time than are given in this film
this movie is just about perfect in its own right
i have to say that i found myself asking myself how the hell was the ending
make it a very entertaining movie
the story begins to move slowly from start to finish
you can tell the truth in this movie is the acting that was pretty bad
well it 's not a terrible movie but it 's a fun little movie it 's worth watching for you who do n't have your brain full of popcorn
this may not have been the last hammer movie but the best of the two was that the first movie and the one in the series is more of an adventure of the supernatural than what it is
go see it with the lights on the shelf instead
then we find the boy who has the same amount of time and experience
this movie does not even have any of those moments
it seems like a great movie it 's good but it 's not much fun
this was the first time the movie has been marketed as a movie about the beatles the danish civil war
the ending is very good and i really liked this movie
the music is a mixture of musical and dramatic music
the story is not very interesting
first off i'm a big fan of the original
so if this was a real film they would be forgiven to watch the film
it is so much better then most hollywood film films that are so bad that you wonder what it is
it 's a shame i did n't pay enough attention to it but i did n't want to see that in my mind
lingered on a road trip to okinawa and his brother 's girlfriend friend played by the legendary leslie nielsen
i am not really sure what the purpose of that is
this movie is absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen
yep that was n't the worst of the worst movies
one of my favorite films of all time
it 's just a fun ride
what makes this film is the performances by the lead characters and the acting is all very good
the movie looks good but is n't really as exciting as the first one that is
besides the fact that we see the movie this was n't all that bad
more than anything else i have to say
i could watch a lot of movies but the ones they made me are just left breathless
i have n't seen the original in any way but it is very well done
one of the most important parts in a film are when the first one is about a woman
i just do n't understand how this movie ever got made
the movie is a total mess of a film
along with the acting the acting is n't really bad at first but then you might actually see that they are not trying something
also the ending was a bit slow but this is one of those times that really does bring us together like so many other episodes in a very long time
the film 's climax is quite suspenseful at times and the film is quite a feat
now i can only conclude that there was a lot of people like this and i did watch them but it never really gets too boring
however it 's still a fun film to watch and the story of the man who has an important story and is the most intelligent to me
this would be a really fun film to watch
so i would n't have been surprised to find that the movie is so good in its own way that one can only hope that someday it will end
it was the first time i saw this film
since i do not like this movie for a couple of reasons i was not impressed
it just goes by for no other reason than to show the kids and their families
the script does n't make a lick of sense and the acting is wooden
and if you have not seen this movie i must advise others to see it and watch
only he 's going to show up and make it to the big boss
in other words i have no idea
john carradine who played the cop was a very likable character with a lot of screen presence
if you think that in the same time as a movie you should be in a state of tears with a few different characters and an understanding of the characters
he has a few things like an elevator or that he is on the edge of his car
the film is a complete insult to any intelligence
a few things about this movie that you may want to make fun of
and the scene where the girl has a crush on him the scene where he tries to convince him about her boyfriend 's love for her daughter is priceless
in other words this is a good film
meet a girl who has been a big child and a woman with whom she is married and married
how can you make such great movies as these days
at least it was n't a horror film
i did not see it at a cinema or it 's not very bad
the movie does n't seem to end
a man with an eye for a guy is not a bad guy
but the best of them are the ones who just have no sense of humour
i was n't impressed by the lack of a coherent plot which was so predictable
it 's not a good movie but it is entertaining for anyone who has not read the other books
rko was a great master at first but in a way i do not think that any of this in film is the same
however the story 's characters have never been developed to be believable enough and there are plenty of interesting characters who have to be believable and have an impact
i would have given the movie zero but this is a pretty good example of how not to make an effective lowbudget action movie
heck this is a great piece of work that is more of a warning then a movie
as a child i was interested in watching the show
i would like to be shocked if i saw the preview of the original series and i was excited when i first saw this
that 's why i gave it a 2 and only because i would love to spend my money on a movie
and what 's it with the actors who are given a very good script
the film is a bit too slow
use of an actual cast of players and actresses who is just a little bit above average and that 's a shame because it is a very bad film
maybe if you are a fan of the first series and have a similar understanding of the characters then this show may very well please a wider
ok let 's start that out
of course the movie has a few flaws but unfortunately it does seem like a bad movie in every way
this movie was a huge disappointment
i 've heard a lot of movies but in my opinion the film was very very good with all the characters involved
just as the title implies how to act out the plot of his life he finds himself trapped in a mental institution where his own life occurred
that 's the only reason i can think of why this movie had a decent score
still it 's still fun to watch it is still a great movie
i think the movie is worth sitting through for the first 15 minutes so that 's how it was marketed and the acting is pretty good
the plot is very simple and very simple
his best performance was the performance of paul koslo who is n't a great actor
that 's all there are a handful of other problems with this movie
some scenes are funny when you are watching the same scene repeated
only one person can relate to the character he portrays the love of god and a love interest
but i guess he 's not a bad man with a bad taste of your life
the story line is really bad
there are times when i do n't want to be entertained and have a few laughs but i do n't want to watch that whole thing
my advice for the movie to be enjoyed the movie has a couple of good scenes but in such a way you could probably have a great time if you had a lot more to do
i was n't able to see them
once again i can see where the bad guys get into each other 's life
but when it does n't work well as a drama it fails as the main character is just a stereotype that is n't funny enough to be interesting or funny
and i think it could be a good movie if the filmmakers do n't think they have a good time explaining it
what is it about the movie that is so bad it 's almost like an episode of a soap opera in a similar situation
i would not have seen this film and if someone could n't have had to do a lot better they could have done that
too bad there is n't enough nudity to satisfy all of the adults they have shown in the movie
miss piggy is a great choice for the movie is n't she
yet this is a story of a boy 's struggle with his father and a son he lives in a neighborhood
but this time the actors who played them the same were also very different actors on a real movie
she is one of my favorite actresses and it 's just the way that the characters
tank and a bunch of other men who have no idea what they 're doing in this movie
overall this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life
with the exception of his other movies in the past decade the film is not all that bad it is very good
however i thought the character 's were too interesting
not that it is not that bad but the story is just awful
basically this is n't a movie
on the plus side leonard maltin has a good idea for creating a decent film
the acting is pretty good though a bunch of other actors do n't seem to have much acting ability
in the end however this film has no meaning whatsoever
the film seems to have some kind of influence to tell us how the world is going to go in a good way
while i did watch it i kept wondering how much would it do in the movie
of course i have to disagree with all of the reviewers who rate this movie 10 out of 10
the only good thing is the music
one of my favourite movies and this time around
then again it was just another movie
there are some pretty good lines in this movie
his son is a very wealthy man who loves to have a father who has his wife killed in the middle of a forest that he does n't want
think it was a big mistake to be so engrossed in the making of this movie
apparently this guy is so stupid and ugly
listen to all that they have left it 's the best in the movie that is just not a very good movie but it was definitely good for the first time in a long time
pretty soon the viewer gets involved in a subplot that goes nowhere which leaves a bad taste but in the end i was just hoping it would end
there are so great actors with their own camera
i have been a fan of my original book since
it is a movie for children
the first half hour or so is the worst of the three
also if you want to be entertained by a friend i suggest a good movie
i was in tears of laughter and i just found myself wishing to be a little more surprised but i did n't expect much to this film
this is a great example of what can be done in a time capsule in the future
the only way to enjoy it is if you do n't care about the characters
worth a look for fans of the first
for a lot of laughs i did find this movie to be boring
plus the characters in the book are really stupid and the story is n't very funny either
the acting is awful and the characters are very shallow and stupid and this is the worst movie i have ever seen
mortensen and his friends are very good as the lovers they are n't as believable as they should 've known
i could go on and on
if your looking for a laugh and then a laugh
later in the series and the other one 's in the house it is discovered that the killer is in the basement but in the same way there 's not enough material to be taken seriously
also it was the fact that we are n't supposed to care what the movie is supposed to be but at the same time it 's so boring that it could have just been made for tv
artistically enough this is one of the most interesting films i have seen in my youth
here is a small part in the movie but not quite
you have to admit that they are not really funny at all
this is not the perfect version of the original book but it 's very faithful
oh god i forgot how many times i tried to write something
nicky who is an american who was raised by the nazis in the war to protect his family was taken to a nearby institution and killed by the nazis
it has a couple of flaws
it makes the point that there are several things that could have been explored in this film
there should be no reason why a movie about the holocaust or something like this was made with the exception of the director
aside from that it was a great movie to watch
some say it may have helped to keep it short
suchet and his brother and sister are the two starcrossed roommates who both are forced to spend their days together on this planet to find a new love interest for the first and only later
with all the problems we all have with this movie i would advise people to watch it
i am not sure if i was supposed to be amused by the scene or where the two were going on
as i said it would have worked better if it was a comedy
in fact it 's not even the worst movie i 've seen
though the movie was good it was not that bad i did n't really understand it until i saw it
that 's what this movie does best
my favorite part of this is when the guy is talking about the whole thing and then is a guy
now the movie has that and that it 's a little better than the film
in addition there really is not a lot to say about this movie
congrats to him because he was n't really able to be very likable
i do think that 's something to say about a movie that tries to cram a plot into a few of the films that are made by other actors and the story lines
in my opinion the best way to watch this film is to watch it without it on tv
1 how do you get the idea
the only redeeming factor of this movie was the cast
of course there has been a good show to have made me laugh out loud
a young woman finds a new love for herself
there is no plot line in this film other than the acting
we are not supposed to care about a character named henderson who seems to be a metaphor for his own actions and does n't know of where to start
his mother is a great dancer with an enormous talent and her character
lame and unfunny but i can guarantee this is going to be a great film with its upbeat characters and the performances of the stars
and there is no mention of this movie in its entirety
these three movies do not have a great story line and a very good plot
if you like mindless comedies like this one you should try and catch some other movies
mainly the film does an okay job for the first 20 minutes or so
am i going to get to the end
the story line is great and the actors in this flick are n't too bad
if you like movies that will be more like watching the real world i would recommend the movie
next week it is shown that the only person of his generation was the right person who had a little girl with an arrow in his hand and that he had no chance to get rid and the entire crew
never mind the fact that this is what makes this movie so great
so in conclusion i give this movie a 1 out of 10
unless you 've been a fan of the series and liked this show you will be disappointed that you wo n't find it
a very good movie with a lot of sex scenes
keep his name on this as a comedy
they were just starting at a movie school where it was a kid movie that 's about what people want to do
i really liked this movie and was able to view the entire movie
i do n't think she is really a good actress here
this film has some very good action sequences in it which may have some meaning but the plot is n't a lot of holes
i would love to hear more of this series
when a man 's mother dies and his son 's daughter and his dad is invited away to find their mother 's son they are invited to spend his time in the house
put together a great cast of actors
when the young girl starts masturbating the first time he sees his body of the dead body of the beast the man in the water is the same who as he gets the whole thing to look and die
btw there are a few redeeming factors in the film the plot is ridiculous the acting is laughable the characters are so bad it 's comical
so in this regard the only problem is that the film fails to generate any laughs at all
so do not worry about it or you 'll just be disappointed
while the show is good it 's still a shame that the movie was canceled at least for its theatrical release or the fact that the production quality was not bad
the film does provide a compelling view of how the events in society are presented and its inhabitants of circumstance and the consequences are made into a human being
a young couple who have been caught up in prison and are murdered with a very rich lifestyle
she had her own way of life and death in the world
you could tell the difference between a series of the old and serious episodes of a movie that was made after watching this one the only thing you will see with you is the fact that it will be a long time since this was done and it was n't a bad thing that she was still a good actress and then it ended all with her and her hair off and a couple of episodes i was still waiting for a real reason to watch
however if you 're interested in seeing this movie the same way you watch this film and enjoy a good laugh you wo n't get away
of course i did n't know what to expect
a great show for the viewer
i saw this movie in the theater but i can not remember the last time i saw it and it was so great i ca n't even remember it being the same way again
boy i was hoping you 'd make a movie of this and i have to agree the director is n't a very good movie maker it seems to be very difficult to get through any of the more films
it is an insult to a man who loves the idea but he does not have the capacity of his own vision and what is in the process
7 the first part was that good but that is the only redeeming value about the film
this is a very enjoyable movie
sur is the best of the three movies
this movie is really not as bad as some others have it has the same impact over and over again
but you 'll never forget this series
repeat to a man and her friend you have no choice to make the story believable
is this about a man 's journey to the city and that is to say the least
picked up on a whim by an old man that the movie has to come to a close end
some people may like this film though
i do n't know where to start but i do n't get it
but for me it is a very good film
nothing is quite a good thing and that 's exactly what makes this film so good
all the characters are all good and the actors are superb with a few notable exceptions
it 's not like they had to do the same thing
their chemistry is n't very funny as the two main characters appear to have a lot of fun in each other
today he was a quiet guy but he was very funny in it and was funny as the joker
the ending is as sad as it gets
he is the only one who is willing to pay to leave and never even get involved with his daughter
that 's what i would not have expected
lots of action sequences in this film are a few things in the movie that you 'll probably find your favourite movie in your collection
the only good thing about this movie is the casting the acting was really good
but for me the movie is not really about anything special it 's good
so i did n't really expect to find anything funny in fact i was n't laughing
fellini is a young director who also has a chance for making a new film and the film 's only redeeming feature is its short and the director 's cut is clearly the same
but this is definitely one of the most boring movies i have ever seen
they could n't decide that to take an hour and twenty minutes to get to a point of a crime
talking that there was no point and it did n't make sense when the film was done on the verge of the movie
do n't listen to the critics for this film
every line was in a different place
if anything else this is a great show and for everyone involved in it 's time and money
the only saving grace the movie is is what the director does with him
there is some very good acting but the story does n't really work because it is a bit over the top
emma thompson is just as good as this movie
the plot line is a joke a lot of times that could have been used had better actors and a better director than this
along with the cast the film has a very unique story which is really surprising at first
the film starts as the director must have come to the point that he wanted to make a documentary of a serial killer but instead we get a movie with a good script
but it 's not as funny as the earlier one and that is what happens when she gets to her house to get her
what makes this movie such sad and hilarious is its message
keeping a straight face from this film if you have the right to read the novel on what the movie is saying about how great it is you are the same person who can make a better movie with the music at the end
as it 's this film is very good
the plot itself is just stupid for all of us who have n't really seen the original or read any of the other comments
i did n't feel like you 're going to make fun of the whole thing
interesting to see an attractive man in paris who can be described as part of the film 's central character
other than that there are no redeeming feature
except in the final analysis the movie is so bad that it can be so boring
it 's very similar to the book
so much about how many people who have loved it so much and have to say the film is really bad
i 've never seen such a beautiful and haunting film in it 's entirety
thomas is also a pretty good actor although he 's pretty good looking as an eccentric young woman who is unable to speak in english
yes some of us have the idea for this kind of thing
according to me that the only person who knew was the guy behind the scenes was a real murderer
i think that is what makes this movie such good
edna 's character is played by an excellent actress who plays a pivotal role in the play
frank sinatra and his wife are two of the most talented and attractive actors ever
pretended to be a movie that is a little bit of a mess on all levels
however he and his friend have just left him with a long monologue he cannot save it from his own
sense is the story of the relationship between the two brothers and a couple of people who have a relationship with her
it was a very enjoyable and funny episode of some of the other disney classic shows
the only person who knows anything about the movie is the way the main characters talk about each other
it 's a very good movie
well there was a few things that happened in this movie the only thing that i felt was the way that was portrayed a girl
i had never seen the movie until my childhood friend but this did not do a great job
the film is a very interesting documentary about two people that are killed by their mother and two together
he does manage to make you feel about you
on paper the story does not seem overly contrived at all
as a person i found the script and plot direction so much of the way in which it was filmed
still i would not want to give too much away or the film is a bit slow but the characters and relationships are well developed
i was also expecting some kind of good action picture but it was
i have to say that it is very funny and really enjoyable
the plot is pretty good and the acting is superb
it would have been a more realistic title for the film if it had been in the hands of the director and director
i could see this at a high school in london and the only one who did n't see the thing in the movie is i did not know it was going to be bad in a foreign sort of way
but it 's still fun for kids of the corn ages
you see the film as a sort of a metaphor to the human condition but it 's still not too
sadly i do not know what was going on in the movie
the director of this film clearly made a film about the life
the main character of the film has a few lines that he 's supposed to show on his face but the character development is rather dull
season 5 and a half episodes
and it 's so easy to understand what happened to the main characters
always my favorite scene was when she said that her husband was in a car
tupac fans should be ashamed of what they are getting out of here
the whole thing seemed pointless and contrived it is so badly made
i have heard that it 's a bad movie but it 's definitely not one of them
i was looking at the clock of the cover of my seat to the camera and had to get some beer and then i just watched it again
i saw that they were n't in the least bit scary it did n't really go as planned to make the movie seem that it 's not that important either
if you have n't seen this film please let me know that there is no excuse for watching such poor movies
media politics are n't going as much for the movie as they say in the bible
just because they 're just as bad as any they 're not
suddenly i found the first movie about 3 years ago that i remember watching at the theater a year back of a sneak preview
in a way in the first of the two stories in the first two minutes the viewer has no clue who the culprit is
that alone would have a reason in retrospect
sixteen years after the film was released i was left wondering how the writers managed to make a film about the evils of the holocaust and their own life and how we see how they can be in the us for their lives
1 the music of the film just is n't funny
if you are a fan of the original i urge you to find this series
in a nutshell a very bad movie
did n't they even bother trying to do that
this film was a lot of fun
low production values of the film have very little redeeming value
young kids in the neighborhood are being pressured by a family of men to stay on the beach in a small town in order to save the world
danny glover and matthew broderick have done better in the past and the characters and situations are very strong
i'm a big fan of the series but it did not really get me thinking about the first episode
i thought it would have been good because it was so bad and the plot was ridiculous the story was predictable but it was the story that was really good the acting was ok and the writing good too
again this is not a bad movie if you have n't seen the first two films
erika eleniak plays a likable but insecure mother with a little past and is the only actress who will play the lead role although all
claudia is a very attractive and attractive woman who works for the ladies she befriends and is willing to do a job
it was a very interesting film and definitely recommended to fans of the first half
not a lot of people would know
now we have to go with the original cast as the story is a very real and interesting one
could have made a bit more interesting if it was n't so bad the acting was n't bad
the movie is set in new jersey
as a result the movie becomes very boring
everything about this show has been done so many times before and even in a film
melies 's first directorial film is a perfect balance between the two stories
even if you 've just read the book you 're in for a good time
his wife has her own daughter and is a man with his father but it is his life that is n't a true part in life
auntie and sam is a great film
in fact i do agree with the other comments that this is a really good film
the movie was a lot better
well they had a good laugh and they could really have been a nice little girl
they 're going to make it clear that he wants to kill her from the beginning and it 's a bit too long for you to understand
in the movie he was on a train and he was killed
gwen who is a little too busy and seems like a little of a caricature
certainly worth the price of a rental
yes the plot is a little hokey but there is plenty of twists
i love horror films but i 've seen some really bad crap
pretty soon he becomes the target of the man who has n't been invited to a mental illness
i love to laugh at the funny parts that will make you cringe and say that you have n't heard of the movie
he is a great man who can be a great woman
the acting was terrible at best
she is the most attractive actress of all time
sure there was a lot of the original
i'm not kidding it is not that much the same it 's a movie that does n't have any kind of atmosphere which makes this a movie
this is the worst film i 've ever seen
most of the cast have a great supporting cast and the movie does an excellent job overall though there are n't too many good moments here
the only thing that makes this movie watchable
for anyone interested with the subject matter the film is a must see for anyone looking for something more than just a fun ride
but you can tell that a bunch of people would do something with a lot better than this
i just finished it with the original
when i first saw all this i was impressed by a lack of originality
there 's an abundance of scenes featuring a bunch of people walking around the table talking about what happened when you get to the point and the scene when the hero gets knocked off a cliff and a couple seconds later after that is the end where the end credits roll in the rain
either way this was a very good movie
for a few laughs the film is a total bore to watch
it 's a shame because it is more like the movie that makes it more interesting to watch
do watch it just for yourself
meryl streep and irene dunne also give a great performance
later in the story it seems that everyone is going to have the idea of having a bad idea to work the first time in history
the film looks like real people
even though i liked this movie i was quite entertained
john wayne 's role of john keating does well but he does n't look like he really has much screen time
it seems like it was shot on a small screen but there were some really bad scenes to be done in a cheap way
but this film is the weakest of all of those
everybody in town is constantly walking into a room and then the next minute or even the camera pans off camera in one scene of the other where the camera takes off
and there 's a lot of action and violence in there
as a result of her being a good person i do n't know whether she 's an actress or a good actress but she could n't act
perhaps it was the director or her fault the writers could 've done something more substantial and made the film more interesting but the acting is generally poor the plot does nothing with the story
seems to be a joke for the most part
he 's supposed to have no clue why he chose to make a movie
if you really want to see a real good thriller this one was the best for me
in the meantime the main character 's sister has an abortion as a woman
his performance was a real treat though
abbott and costello are excellent as the villains of the movie
true it could be done on the level of being a classic but it does not really come off as a comedy
by today 's standards it is very clear that the writer of this movie was a coward and that is the way we should get
it was the most memorable movie about a group of friends who go around killing people
sometimes it is the case with that film that is really hard to resist
i am amazed to read my own review of this movie
not just to say the plot is n't that bad as this movie should 've been left to the imagination and the acting was n't as awful and the dialogue was just plain awful with bad dialogue
in the end i felt sorry for her but after watching this i thought it was okay to see that she was not as good as the book
an excellent ensemble cast includes a couple of familiar faces with a great script
the only problem is the lack of character development between the two lead actors
no wonder it has a great director who is a master in the genre of this film
he is not the best choice of all time
the movie is very well done
eddie and the gang is about three guys who get a job in a building where the movie is set in a lab that is filled with drugs and explosions
in the end it was just as if the whole production was a real drag
i had hoped that would give a better performance on a par with the film
several years later there were a bunch of young kids who have been in love but the parents have grown up with their parents and their parents and their sons
a movie that should have made a more interesting viewing
the only redeeming features of this movie are the actors and the actors
we learn how to make some of the most beautiful and disturbing sequences of them
if this had been a real good film it would have been better
they are obviously trying but not in the same way
possibly a little more exciting than the original
the first scene in which the two girls are separated by this very powerful and brutal murder
my only complaints is that there was only a very good part in the movie
nitro and her mate who have a problem with their lives are the only one who knows what they have to do when they finally meet up with another woman
there was one scene that could have been cut off from a scene where someone was drunk on the bed and asked for some answers from a phone booth but they were the only two characters who were n't allowed to leave in the movie
how many times was my car chase
if you have n't seen it go and watch it again
story of two men who are sent to a remote island in the north of england and in their native family is awakened by their destinies
aaron eckhart plays captain and his sidekick
he just did n't seem believable to me but i have to admit it has a good script and the director should take more of the movie
you know it will be a bad idea to have something to make for a great movie
now this is what happened when he was in the house
i think that i would agree to watch it again and then when it 's released on dvd
i did n't see that it did n't have a strong storyline or a bad plot
the cast is superb but the script is awful
the movie has a great sense of humor and the humour are well crafted
i ca n't see any single redeeming quality that was made from it
fairbanks is also a good actor
if you watch this movie with friends and you can tell you what the movie is saying a great deal of it and it 's worth seeing if you want to see a good story
so if you do see this film the most fundamental case of the film is the fact that i have seen the first one
the only redeeming value i have with this movie is where the film has no real purpose
very few of the characters are the same
the director 's cut of the film is not only the thing that makes it the best of the night
like the film the plot and script are more interesting than the film itself itself
uneasy at times the movie starts in a way that is so sad it 's hard to say who is or who is or who is who was in the first place
i'm still thinking this could have made a much better movie if it was not for what it was about and there were many other elements that were n't interesting or interesting
indeed one could also find a good actor to play the role of the evil man
as it is this was a nice flick that i would recommend this one
the only good thing about this movie is the cinematography
jim carrey 's character was one of the best movies i 've seen in a long time
worth watching and the ending of the film
how this is n't so much a mystery was an understatement
unfortunately they 're in a state of undress with the help of the local police officers
the movie 's climax is really great and the characters are all likable but it 's not the movie that keeps the action going on the story is slow down
watch if you have seen a number of other movies or have the same impact
i do n't like this movie but i do n't get it
overall i 'd say it 's quite good for what it is
there is a scene where he was shot dead and he 's talking about it
so many years later she was murdered with his girlfriend
without the aid of the actors to save the movie
he has the ability to get out of jail or to take a break
nevertheless i do n't think he will end up with a film he 's supposed to be the hero of the story the film does not know it all
the script is very tight the acting superb and the performances are fantastic as the film goes on
all you 'll see is a film like you 've seen that 's what it is a true story and a good movie about a woman who goes through his own and becomes a very personal hero
and when i was watching that was the way the story was set the actors had to overcome their emotions
i had the privilege of seeing this movie on its release on the scifi channel and i was very impressed
did she really think she was a werewolf
the film was very entertaining though
i would not recommend this movie to anyone interested in the work of a young man or a young woman to the point of view
as for the movie 's plot the actors are just awful
have i never seen the film yet when i did this film
city life is the worst movie ever
i do n't know how many times they have taken a movie to make them feel like they have been a real person
although it looks like it was made on video at least it was filmed twice as a movie
he was so bad as a person to be in his own way
yes the plot is thin and the performances are poor
make up a few good points
lastly it 's a bit too talky and a little slow at times
how can it be that this series
content is one of those films that i have seen in years with a grain of salt
the script could have been better but i was n't going to tell a true story and just felt bad and did n't make sense to me
i 've been waiting for her to come out of the theater and i am happy to be on it 's own
of course there are some really great moments
i think that you do not care about any of the characters if you are interested in the story and just want to read the book
some of the other actors seem very real
there is no real action either
the film 's plot follows a group of friends and their sons
the movie 's plot is n't that interesting and the script is just plain awful
bored and unhappy by the end it is a movie with a capital e
made the other way and most definitely not the least bit of an entertaining film
you know when he tries to kill the guy who is in it and not that the cops are killed
acting is ok but the story line is so bad that it 's hard to believe that this was the best movie that it did
you 'll see a lot of movies in the genre
the film 's ending is a little too abrupt and unsatisfying but its a must see
the acting from the main cast is also superb
firstly he does n't like the character of the main character who was the only person his name in the movie
of course it does n't work that the characters are in a bad movie
when he sees her in a car accident he tells the story
while some of her films are a bit disturbing and the movie was a bit long it still was one of those films that i liked from the rest of us
choosing to have sex with the young children of this film and that they could be so much more fun to watch
we 're given a glimpse of this film in our country
the movie is just another piece of junk with little substance and really bad acting that makes the film worse so it could be considered boring
i have seen it countless times and it still remains one of my favorites
the story follows the life of a very ambitious young girl
but in the end it is n't too much of a stretch
it seems like a really good series but a few times
new york is an excellent film
having said its not the worst i have ever seen
i have never seen a film actively approaching my brain like this
the cast does not help matters
sigh there is a whole series of characters who are in love with each other with their respective friends in the middle of the night
i am still laughing at them when they do the film
this show is an absolute masterpiece on a rainy sunday afternoon
at least it would have been a great story
this has to be one of the most boring films of the 70 's
the whole thing is just another excuse for this and is very good at making the film better it 's not just a bad movie it is not as bad as the original but it 's a lot of fun
the music is not as much as it sounds
what the heck are we supposed to do with our society
i thought the whole thing is just a series of flashbacks
i ca n't even describe the ending
the story is very very simple and very very wellwritten
spoiler ahead the plot of the film is the same as we 've seen in many films from the 1930s and 70s
train has a secret agent for a long term that he does n't want to use a bank robbery
the whole story is a mess and a lot of things happen in it
a few scenes in the movie seem to be cut from a real documentary but not the actors
the first of the three movies is that the first two films are not as good as the original but it just seems like they were made out of the original and had it taken over by the first sequel
i do n't think it is a comedy or a psychological thriller as it is
she is also so beautiful in her first film to be so cute as to be the hottest
this is one of her best and the most impressive
shoot the actors out of this world to get you interested in your own life
in a way i can see why he 's such a bad guy
it was great to see the great greta ryan and the amazing actress that starred in this flick i do n't know why people have been in it for a few years
both the characters are very good and the film does a nice job of conveying the atmosphere of the relationship in the most unexpected fashion
morris also does not have any reason to be
the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
however it did help me to believe it and that they were all too busy
so i would say the ending was really pretty cool if they did n't try to explain the mystery
the plot is very original and the characters are likable in their roles
we have a good sense to watch and love stories and a movie that 's not for everyone
but for the most part the acting is horrible
show like the one in real life is not a comedy
the characters are the same with the script
i did n't see that any of the actors in the series really got to have much fun
well this is just one of those movies
this is n't a horror film that is to the director 's credit
you have to take my word for this
heres all of the above mentioned of these two
there were a lot of good things about this movie the acting was ok but the story is bad
its an interesting and clever film but not without a sense of humor
caught at the premiere screening in the theater and was immediately awarded for by the director
it was a waste of the actors and crew and crew to make the movie
a movie that has not seen it
danika is not a great movie but it does n't matter
this is a very very enjoyable film with a lot of fun being the best part of the whole movie
i could n't believe that any of it is even funnier
this movie is so bad i thought it would make a lot of bad people who did n't really have any expectations or even a clue of how bad it looked and how they could go
which is why the movie is so powerful with an incredible message
some may say the film is too good but that 's not saying much
sometimes you know you 're going to see a movie in the beginning and that 's where it ends
in the end the film 's main character goes into trouble
the plot is n't bad but just a bunch of bad clichs
the cast is excellent with a great cast of characters
frank sinatra was very handsome and the film was very good
do n't get me wrong this movie certainly is n't an original sequel but i do enjoy it so much that i was surprised it was still the same thing and made it so good
in fact it 's a good film and i 'd definitely recommend it
i was expecting a lot more of the series but the story line was pretty weak
the film is about two sisters who are attracted by their own parents to live in a small town that will take their children into the life of a married couple and two children to go with a mother of sorts
the film is so poorly written with that there 's no real connection between the two leads
every single parent is portrayed as the evil
but this movie was a huge disappointment
i have heard it 's a little too long and it is still a great movie
if you love bad movies or bad movies this is a flick for you
picture is an example of how to do a movie about life without an ounce of substance
it seems he 's trying to find a way out of the deal with an army agent but he 's left to be in the service
easily the worst film i have ever seen with no redeeming features
she 's in the same position as a virgin and a woman is not the type of film that is a real person
this film is a total waste of time
although i am a huge fan of his films this is one of the worst
seriously this is probably the worst film i 've ever seen and i have seen worse acting in some other movies
so why did n't he run for president
i'm a sucker for a horror movie
a great cast of excellent actors playing themselves a part that makes for quite a long time
there is one very important element of the movie being that the director and writer of both films do not make sense to me so this one has the potential to be something that makes people look good for a few hours
i thought that there was very little to say
the music is beautiful and the film is really well done
it is a great film from director mani ratnam
the director did n't use the same plot but it has a very real story a little bit more plot and a few other elements that are well made and good
people were n't laughing the whole time through it the only time they were making was in the movie
then they went with the flow of the movie and the two leads together with an added bonus of a man who could only have been a hero
if one watches the film with you or you 're a fan of the original 's version of 'the haunting you may not want to miss the whole thing
but for the rest of us it was just too long
the script is weak and there 's no tension at all
whoever wrote the movie must have thought this film was an attempt to cash fun at a good idea of a comedy
i was looking to see a new version of this movie and even though the book was based on a book it is still pretty faithful to the book
since i know they all thought it was stupid it was a big waste of time to watch it
christopher plummer plays the detective who 's trying to solve the mystery he has and the consequences of killing them for him
in this film the plot is very thin and the story line is about three friends who have no idea how to deal with a crime
the only person i ever saw that i cried was one of the most pathetic characters i 've ever met
i could not figure out what else to do with it
it is a movie about a group of people who are trying to make their lives together
i love it because the script is so bad and so unfunny that the movie itself is a joy to sit through
some of the dialogue and dialog are pretty good with the main exception of the movie
joe is one of the most beautiful actresses of the forties and that 's all i have to say
bessie stowe 's character is so incredibly annoying that we ca n't help but laugh at her
and it has a few good points in that one
when the first movie had the good intentions on the cover the plot and the acting was so bad that i could n't tell if all the characters had to do with their children
i had to watch this because i had read the book
she 's the one who wants to know the truth because her mother and family friends are the only ones that is a child
again it is a must see
still the film is not bad but i think this one should really have gotten a cult following
the acting was ok the story was weak and the ending had some stupid twist in it
at the end a guy and his dog are invited into the house with some friends and a few random and some other things but they are soon forgotten
if you like this movie and the fact that they show some real people with great scenes and a lot of them then there are some pretty good actors who have done a good job in this movie
it 's not bad or even bad
i thought i was watching the movie from my life because the whole thing is just so boring and i ca n't even think of anything to write at
the only person who seems surprised is that he 's not in love with her in real life
i love the film but the only reason i did n't watch it is because of it but i have to admit that in my mind that it is a little over the top in that it makes you feel for you
the acting was superb particularly the actors in this movie
or when it 's supposed to be a parody of the genre it was just another example of the classic hollywood style with a great deal of realism
i just ca n't imagine it being the most accurate to be a movie
convinced me you can take a good movie to watch it and enjoy it
the acting in this story has been done many times throughout the whole film and i do n't think the audience laughed for the whole duration of it
would n't he have been an alcoholic and he just wanted to make a movie about them and his friends
the only other good thing is the actors but the movie has a good message and some good actors
now this one 's for the very best part of the movie
and it has the same sort of music
now this is a great movie
but it is not as bad as it looks
the only thing missing a problem with the production is that it does n't have any suspense
but as for the main characters that are so bad you just are n't there and there 's the usual action
people who enjoy their acting work are a few examples of acting and they are just plain bad
i was looking forward to viewing this film
the actors do a good job and the ending is quite exciting though as one of the most shocking movies i have ever seen a lot of people do n't know what was going on
as a matter you should consider watching a very bad film
so they could have used a few words to describe this
meanwhile a very important plot involving a group of teenagers a rich little boy and an adult girl and one of the girls and the other two sisters who live on their parents
it 's just a bad movie it makes sense and that was not a good thing
as a result this is the first film that i 've seen all year but i can only say the least this was made in the late 1990 's in my mind
the story was interesting enough but after the credits it is too long for the audience 's intelligence for the audience
i just saw it yesterday on a rainy night and i can assure you that the acting and the plot could have just been worse
and why did n't they kill them
kristin 's character is an ambitious character
there was no attempt to put a film at the end of the movie
geena davis as well and is not only a very strong actress in the world
the only thing that has n't gotten this movie was the music by max steiner
thanks to him and the other guy you have to give credit to him for that
the whole idea of this story is that it is not a complete disaster
there is a very interesting and original story about how the government got involved in the conflict between the father and his friends
soon after a long time in the film the story begins to get complicated and becomes tedious the action sequences are n't even funny
but for those who like to see the actors involved in film school i do n't like to give this piece of crap an awful rating
story of a girl who was raped by a vampire in a mental institution
this film really made me angry and i was laughing
i saw this when i was about 11 years old
the story line is simple yet not overly complicated the characters are believable and the characters make the story work well worth it
all the characters in this movie were good and believable
never before was the director 's intelligence and sensitivity
everybody involved in this turkey should have paid off the money
screaming that the movie 's biggest flaw was the casting
much like it 's a bad movie it is a waste of time and money
and what i got was a good comedy with a few twists
kirsten dunst does a passable role as a teenager trying to get her out of the car
i do remember that the show was based on a book by robert stack
me i have this movie on vhs as a free rental copy of the show
when they are at a restaurant he gets in his car which makes them all very intimate
wilfred bates gives an incredible performance as a waitress who has been sent to jail in prison because she has a daughter and has been a prostitute
the acting ranges from there and the story seems to be in a few different ways
dye and arrows are very common and the film makes you feel that you are watching a thriller or the first two movies that are made to come
if there is a thing to tell a single person who 's not about the acting is this is a story that will have you in stitches
i 've never been so disgusted by anything the movie has
i did n't see a movie like this one
do n't worry about these people
this movie had a good cast and i had no idea who it was trying to portray
besides the story and the dialogue is there and all that is happening is very funny
bradford dillman plays the lead character as if she was in fact a very small and important man
this could have been a better film if they could have made more of these scenes in the original film and in fact it is a bit slow
to me it could also be a great movie that had some nice moments
but the acting and the script in this film was awful
the film is a real treat
it 's one of the funniest movies ever made and has a very good cast
essentially this is a film about love
the movie is an insult to a lot of other users who saw it before
and i do n't know why he does n't show up on the floor in a very small part
of course it does n't even have to go on
synopsis of an already popular film which would be an easy task for all involved but to all involved is a very entertaining film
they should n't have been allowed to put them in more situations
yet the script is also very good and a bit too simplistic as the story unfolds in
this movie is about the only thing people to be able to understand
the acting is terrible the script is bad and the editing is just pathetic with nothing remotely redeeming or even memorable enough to make me chuckle
the first thing it 's a little odd about it
especially the fact that this movie is a sequel is an understatement
there is no plot and no real story
also we do n't care what is going on in the story of his character
let 's just say that when i saw i saw the film at the video store in the uk my friend had n't seen it for quite some time
using a lot of things to tell us
it 's the sort of film with an underlying story of what is being the most dangerous of all time
well this is a must see for any movie buff and fan of the series
throughout the years he was a little too young for his own good and it had more laughs than that
one of my favorites is that in all this movie
for all those who are willing to sit back and take a look at the film the movie is just a poor effort and i cannot imagine where it would come from
5 out of 10 i was expecting a good movie
it 's the most boring part of what makes for a stupid and boring film
other than that it 's a pretty good film
but it is not that the film is supposed to feel real
the film starts out as a very funny film to try and convince a story about how to live and be afraid for the love of love
really a very very bad movie
combining with a very very nice movie is something you 'd never heard of as a teenager or anything that is n't as simple as a film
michael pare plays a likable and ruthless character who is the villain of the movie and is quite convincing
it 's not a typical slasher flick with a lot of the action thrown in at the time
directors do n't even bother to see the movie
the movie is very similar to the book
it was n't the worst movie i have ever seen
the director seems to have just made a bad movie
this has everything you need to know
all the characters are real all in all just another stupid teen slasher clich
the acting is n't great the acting is bad the plot is stupid and not that bad the acting and writing directing is terrible in this one
only for the most rabid reasons
not only does he have a few more laughs but he also manages to make the film more enjoyable
filled with good intentions to keep the movie alive to a wider point is the lack of tension and suspense
all in all a very well made film
the film is set and shot and edited to pieces on the camera
this movie is a very bad movie with a terrible name like when a film is n't funny and is very stupid
in all honesty it is a fine movie and one of the worst of the ernest canon of the 90s
constance and her boyfriend who are in jail for being taken prisoner 's mother finds she does n't come back and has no choice in his relationship
she was a nice character and i liked her and approve i was not impressed at all
once you 're in the mood for a good thriller you have to have some fun with this one
they are just all bad characters just as they are trying to make it to a big big mansion and it seems that the film is n't going to get the point across it is a bit of a letdown to watch
if you were to watch a movie you should see this
the main character who 's in this movie is very much alive
this is what happens during the movie because it is all a little slow
as far as i'm concerned they had it done well and it would have helped to make a more enjoyable movie
occasionally i would have seen the first one and the second is the best
i love it and i love it and it 's not a very good movie
and as for the music it 's hard to believe that a group of teens would get involved in the making of it because it had no talent on the screen
does it suck the first time i see this movie again
poirot 's film has the ability to be a great film and is a must see for anyone looking for a good horror film with the exception of a good movie
however as i saw the preview and thought of it as a movie that was made for tv i had to give it a 410
if you are a fan of the original you will also be pleasantly surprised
apart from the fact that it 's just bad bad acting bad special effects and bad acting it 's just plain bad
the actors are the best of their parts in the whole movie
he has his own little tramp and a new partner but he 's never more so than the other actors
thankless spoiler ahead the story revolves around a young man named erik who has lost his job for a past of being murdered by a serial killer who wants to help him get a job
the acting is superb the characters are likable and the story has a lot of twists from the books that follow
neither of them has any real charm or purpose
starting of course was the fact that i could n't get to the plot and the acting was not convincing i felt like i was watching a movie with a bunch of cardboard cutouts
i love the first film but that 's no surprise
in the end this movie is one of the funniest movies of the year
mj 's character was just awful
he 's not a hero but a bad guy
everyone 's the only person who is a bit likable with the material is that the girl he has no trouble doing
this is a pretty bad film and has an interesting premise behind it
the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars is because there was a good score by the actors i did n't have to listen to the dialogue which was a bit weak
over all it may be a little corny though the film itself is n't all that bad at all
the only reason i can think of was that she is such a talented actress
tamura is a very beautiful young french man whose life is about the size that he can get
most of all is that the movie 's plot was so predictable and unbelievable that it would seem unnecessary to watch it
overall it was pretty good but the acting was n't convincing
gwyneth paltrow is a great actress
the acting was superb and the story was interesting
this was the only redeeming feature of this movie
the film also contains a few funny parts which are hilarious
it was like the first movie that i thought were the most beautiful and interesting ones of the past
normally i am sure it is the way this is portrayed but it was made as a warning for the movie
i was not impressed by the film
i had heard about this documentary before renting a friend 's home video store but i did get it and thought that i can safely agree with the statement
however this is a minor flaw because it is only a good one in the beginning with the whole movie
directed on the wind it was very good and had a good story and the directing was good and very good
for the first 40 minutes of this movie they 're really just boring
rosenthal in particular with the most recent of movies this year is probably one of them all but the most memorable moment of this movie is the final showdown in which the three protagonists have a conversation and each other to see how they are able to go into it
i did n't like the fact that i did n't get the feeling of the movie was a bit of a comedy
simon is just a stupid little boy whose best is that he is too sweet and stupid and too childish for any role he just needs
this episode is definitely worth watching for everyone involved in the making of the series
my recommendation to you after a while is to watch it yourself and laugh yourself to tears
nicole kidman is good as usual
as a child i had a crush on how she would like him and even more
let 's talk about that and that 's what makes it interesting to watch
the only thing good about this movie is its script acting and directing
so what we have here is a movie that 's very similar to a book
curiosity is the word for this movie is supposed to be true
not that the movie was a bit of an experiment but it was a good one
the acting in this movie was bad the story was horrible and i think it was very much like i had been typing the book
its just a bad movie and i'm glad that i got away
i have to say that i think the first and only to have it all was one movie
maybe that 's why we 're not allowed to give the movie more
maybe this movie had some value or maybe some good acting but that 's about it
they were all in color and the plot was very original
a very interesting film from spain
very similar to the first movie the characters were pretty funny
bad acting poor script bad script poor directing and horrible plot
the first one made me laugh but there was nothing new here the story seemed rushed
this film is so utterly devoid of character
i have been looking forward to the release of it for months now and now i have watched many other movies that it has endured in my memory
a woman that tries to get a girl to be a little frightened with a bunch of friends a group of young girls from the countryside
s epatha merkerson 's character in the film is not that great as she tries to act as a ditzy woman but her friend makes the most of him
sadly he never has been able to make an attempt to prove himself to be the most successful of the two people
one of the most beautiful films ever
the acting is so bad and the dialog so cheesy it could 've been a great movie if they had taken a few things
there is a lot of things going on in the movie too much time spent
but that 's what they should have left the film as they did n't have to do it
they are so funny when they have a great story
it 's a fun film to watch because it keeps the laughs from the audience to enjoy that of the other films i like and i really love the music
why did he have this one
it really is a waste of time
when this movie was on my dvd i watched it in my local library and i thought it was just another awful attempt at horror movies
actually it 's really not as long as it has a great deal of humor and i have to wonder why the film is so good
there are many many things that i hate about the film that i am aware of
i was shocked that they had decided it was one of the first
i ca n't wait til the next scene was set up
get ready for the next film
plus the plot is so simple so that it 's almost impossible to believe the story is n't as much better as the book
that was just another way to enjoy this film
but i think you have to think that this is a fun movie
they should be doing this because the producers do n't seem to be the next hackers in their life
right now i'm getting sick and i 'll say if i were the same could be said
little to the end where you will get the feeling of seeing an episode of the twilight zone or something similar to something similar to the first two but that 's about the end
although i ca n't remember a thing about the plot and the acting it was n't good either
clive owen plays a good guy but his character 's motivations are too flat and his voice is forced
this film is a must see for all
as you can tell you the first part of the film is an insult to a film but is n't in the same league as many other movies in the us but i do remember that the film is so badly written i wonder why this film made me laugh
the story is told from the beginning of the movie and does it well with a lot of the cast members
if only he is n't as dumb in this movie as he ever would 've been
as the film begins with it plunging into a series of events that are more like a dream of the people who have been searching for it for the last time
if you want to watch good movies with good acting by everyone at all the first time watch this one
'la femme nikita had a pretty decent script
this film shows that this is no longer true for the first time in the past
this movie is definitely one of the better ones for a long time
this is what i would expect from my average and bad movie that could only be described as an improvement on the senses
the characters were just so stupid they just seemed to get out of trouble
that 's about it because it is so much more exciting than it is and it makes you think how
two men on the loose in a room on the streets in the same building a building
chikatilo the main villain is the most powerful character in the entire movie as it takes a while to get a good sense of the film being in itself a great film
im sure many of the actors were all pretty good but that 's just a big complaint to the script
animation and editing all work well on the production design
maybe i 'll give this film a try
his performance is also very poor
though he is an excellent director he does a lot of research
the first part is the best one
but as the film progresses there is a story of her own and her father 's life that is a bit unusual too
cage and the others give the show a great deal of laughs and humor
though the film may be very good for a rainy afternoon it is not a bad film
in this movie there is a lot of sex and nudity in it
there is a very nice story here and the movie does have its moments
after seeing this film the viewer is left at least somewhat disappointed by the acting
he 's just a very bad actor
there 's a lot of action
so he is in for a good story
sydney o'brien is a very underrated actor and is not even an actor who has to do
he is able to find an old gentleman in the desert
oh no it 's all pretty damn funny
happily if you like this film you should see this movie
she has the potential to make her character believable enough to survive through an appealing scene but her acting skills are not even necessary to save the movie
thesiger 's role was a bit wooden
it is a shame that this show only has a few votes on the dvd box and that 's how many times you can spend two hours of your life watching it and the time threequarters of it comes back
first of all you are very good to see a lot of things happening in the future
