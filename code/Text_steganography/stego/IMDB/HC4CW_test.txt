the acting was good the story is good but it is n't
however i think it 's a good movie
the film is a complete bore
the acting is good and the story is a bit too contrived but it does have an impact
lots of people have been warned that there are no real people who have a chance of making a movie
craig gould plays the lead as he does in the original movie and he is n't the only one
we get to see the movie as the story unfolds
and the film 's plot was a lot more fun to watch and it was a good movie
also i thought the movie had an interesting premise
she is a very good actress
hackneyed dialogue is the main point of the movie and it does a lot better
basic instinct is a film about a young girl whose mother 's death is a little too convenient for me and her mother to be too much of the story to be told
like i 've seen this movie i was n't expecting anything more
in the end he is n't a good guy
this was the only movie in which i could have walked into my seat with my eyes
and that is a shame because the movie is a bit slow
he was a very good actor but he was so good in this movie and he was n't in it
not a bad film but a good one
she is a good actor and i can understand what is going to happen
meanwhile a woman is killed by a man who is supposed to be a werewolf
i have n't seen the first one since i saw the original and this is a lot better
unfortunately i do think that this movie is not worth seeing
yes it 's a bit of the same with the first two but that was the point i liked it so it was n't the same thing
it 's not a bad film but there is n't much else to be said about it
dr the butler is a very funny movie
read a few comments here on imdb about the movie you have to say the director and writer did not seem very good in the movie
if it had been released theatrically in a small theater i 'd probably not have been able for a good actor
now that i 've watched this show you have a good idea of the show and i am not the first to admit it but this is a good episode to watch
the acting is pretty bad but i really did not see it coming in
i have seen it three and a half and now and i am glad i did n't have to watch it again
great performances by everyone involved with the movie 's script and the acting
eventually he is forced and he 's not a very nice guy
frank morgan is a fine actor
clichs were n't bad but they had to be done with a lot more than a few words and the whole cast did a great disservice
and i do agree that the film is a little over rated
seen in the first film the first time i saw a movie i had never seen before i walked into a cinema with the expectation of the film
and the film is n't that bad
dr hackenstein 's character was so annoying it seemed like a bad idea for a film that was supposed to have appealed
it 's not that it 's a good movie but a great one and the movie is a complete mess of a movie
anyway i think the movie is a great movie
the story is simple and the characters are believable
the story was so bad that you would n't have to watch the movie to understand the mystery of a serial killer and the fact that the main character was a serial killer and the fact that it 's not even scary
i think the movie 's best asset are to see a few scenes in which the film opens
good luck for a film that 's not for everyone who is not in the mood for something like this
although i was n't really expecting a much more coherent story i still enjoyed the film immensely for the characters and their relationships
so if you are a fan you can enjoy a good movie with a few laughs and an occasional laugh
by the end of the movie i was a little confused
it 's a shame that the movie has n't received a wide release since the release in theaters and i have to admit i have never heard of this film
the acting and directing are very good the story and direction are good the acting was great but the writing was horrible
ok i 've seen it all
not only is the story interesting enough the acting is superb
everyone else was just plain bad except to say that the only good things about it are that it 's a little slow and dull
they were so stupid i was laughing hysterically
it 's a very bad movie that is just plain bad but it was n't
from a technical standpoint it 's not the most interesting thing about it
el charro is a very good film and a good one at the box office but it 's not
but the film 's plot was very thin
being a fan i can say i was n't a fan
version is a great example of what a movie is about
they have to go to a party to see what happens when they are together and they are left alone to be the one who has to be in love with the girl
but the movie was n't so bad it was funny and i did laugh
i have n't seen a movie like that before but the fact is that it 's a movie
as the film goes around we see a young man who is a very nice guy in this film as he plays the same role he plays in this film and his role is very convincing and his character is so likable
i think the reason for this film was that they were all going for a very good movie but this was n't one of those movies
bottom line it is a very enjoyable and enjoyable film
i do n't know if it would n't be a bad movie
however this is a very good movie
these are the kind that made it so bad and so bad that it was n't funny at times
in the end the film is not only the most beautiful film in the world but also a great deal of the film
there 's a scene with a couple of men who were killed and killed
the movie is a little too slow and too slow
the film was shot with a lot more money than it could possibly have had been in the first place
he was a great director but he was so obviously trying so much to get a sense that he forgot the story
and it 's the worst movie i 've seen
in a way it 's a great film
it 's a very good story with excellent acting and great music
1 the plot is a bit of a bore but the acting and direction is very good
obviously the film 's producers were n't going to make the same mistake
and the film is a very funny one and a very enjoyable film to sit down to watch a movie
i think this film was a great deal of money and it shows
seems to be an attempt by the director to make the film look artsy but this is the kind of movie i would advise you not even a few years ago
but this is not an action movie
the story is a simple mess of a movie
she is not a good actress and she does a very good acting job
jealous is one of those movies which is a little over the top but still it has a very funny plot that makes you think of a good movie in the same way that you get to watch it
'the unguarded of the dead' was a great film
sounds as though they were trying too hard
spoilers i do n't know how it was possible to be a good actor but i do n't care what happened to him
but the story is so bad and the acting is so bad that it is hard for me
about a half hour into his film we see him in a small role as a tough cop
it 's not a movie that is so boring it is funny but it 's still a good show
however the plot was so predictable and predictable that it made the film unwatchable
actually it 's not that bad but it 's not bad
even though it is the worst movie ever made
thankfully it 's not a bad idea
arming a bunch of people out of the water and a few seconds to kill them all
it has the best of it 's characters in the movie but the plot line was just too weak and the story was so boring
well this movie has a lot of potential and i have seen a few movies that were better than the one i saw and this is one of the worst
a good film that is n't just a vehicle for the director 's work
this movie is a great movie that i think it 's a must watch movie to experience
i do n't want the movie to end and that 's a shame because the ending does not make any impact
the story is very weak but the story line and acting is great
check out the other reviews here here
it is n't a movie about a man 's life and the way it develops his character 's life
he has a great talent for the role
if i were a little bit prejudiced about how the movie is going on and on it does n't have to be
in the first film we get a bunch of bad actors who are trying to get to the bottom and make the whole thing look like something they 'd just want in the end of the film but the movie does n't really have the feel that made it
jokes and jokes are funny and the movie does have its share in its charm
which is a shame since this is a movie that is not even remotely good at times but the film does a good pace and it 's really good that i have a soft tolerance of the film and the way that it is shot in this country is a real treat to watch but not as bad and not a good one
the movie is a complete mess
mortal kombat is a great movie that deserves a wide berth on its merits
this is not a good example
especially the final showdown between two brothers and their gf is one of them and the film is not as exciting
to say that this movie is n't a complete mess of the original is the reason why it 's a total waste of time and money
of course the only thing is that the story was n't a little contrived and the ending was so predictable that it was n't even good to watch
the film has some good points but it is a good film
all in this movie is a good movie
but i was surprised at this film
this is one that should be avoided by everyone and all conservatives
but the film is n't that good either
they are the best and most people in the world who have seen it
he has the ability to make it look like the people who made him the first film
also i thought the movie is a bit slow
it 's not a great movie
we 're told that the film 's only purpose is that it 's not even a movie
on a side of the movie it is a very good performance
the film is very well made but it 's too late for the film and it 's not
unlike the previous films this movie is n't even worth a dollar
it is n't a good thing that the movie was n't as good as i had anticipated but it is not that bad
his performance is the best i 've ever seen
but the film 's biggest flaw is the lack of a story
nothing is explained here that is n't what the film 's main character is and the plot twists are very predictable
nothing happens to the viewer but the characters do n't have any real problems and they are n't really believable
he 's just a guy with a bad name who is n't really a bad actor but a good one as is he
mara is the only person who has the guts to be able to get her to wear a dress
it has a great story and a lot better acting than most films of the genre and it is very hard for a film maker who has a knack for a story
we are shown a lot of things that do happen
it has the same kind of humor that i have seen lately and it 's a shame because it 's not a bad movie
they were all very good actors and actresses in a movie that i would have liked to be in a good movie but this one is n't
the film is not a bad film
i do not recommend the movie to anyone
the film is about a young boy trying to find the woman who has a crush for his life
there 's a lot of action and the film is a bit slow but i liked it
sure it was n't that bad but it 's not that bad
everyone is a caricature and the movie 's climax was so bad that i could n't even finish watching the entire movie
the acting and the direction was very good
this movie has a lot of action and some of the action is a bit slow at first but it is n't that bad either
is it a coincidence that the movie is a little slow
i have seen this film twice and it was one of the most memorable films of the last century
of all the movies i 've made this one must be a little overrated
wow i have to say that i have a soft tolerance for this movie but i do n't know what it means
and it does not work as a drama
incidentally the director 's wife has a lot of money for her and her friends are n't even able at all
every character was a caricature and the movie had an interesting story
this movie is a great movie to watch
i do n't understand how it was going to get released
he is a man who is a very good actor
seeing the film is like watching a documentary
heading on a trip through a door of a house
if you want to see a good film about a serial killer that is a little different than i 've ever seen this movie i recommend the film
madhuri 's performance was so good and the acting is so good that i could n't help thinking of the movie 's shortcomings
the film is about a group that are trapped in a small town in the desert
but the film is not as bad as i thought it would be
i do n't know if this is a bad movie
but the film does n't really have any plot to speak about
dutch 's first feature feature film was a bit of the same but it is still very well done
she 's not the most convincing actress in the world she is the most annoying person i 've ever heard of
why do we get to see a lot
the acting is good but the script and acting are terrible
the acting is very good and it is hard not to like it but for me it 's a very poor movie that is n't even remotely entertaining
throughout the movie there is a very funny sequence in which he tries desperately hard and tries hard to get a few jokes
that is the best way to watch this show i do n't think it 's the funniest show ever made but the best of it is the acting
bits of the film are so poorly made that they seem to lack any sense and are just plain boring and the plot line is so ridiculous and so predictable it 's almost unbelievable that a movie is made
the story is simple and it 's a little slow at points and the ending feels very rushed and contrived but it is a good film to watch
ff7 has a good story to tell and is very good in its presentation
more than a little bit of fun to be had
the story is a little confusing but i do n't think it 's really a good movie
but the story was so weak that i could have had the chance to see it in my local theater and it was a complete waste and i would n't have been surprised to see a lot better known
the acting is very poor the story is bad the characters are boring and the story is just plain boring but it 's just a fun movie that is a joy to sit alone with and enjoy and enjoy the best
the acting in all the characters is just awful and i think it is one dimensional and the most ridiculous thing i have seen in the past
this movie was made by people who were n't expecting a movie about the evils of war
the acting was terrible the story just seemed to drag along at a time and the end result just did n't ring true
though this is a very good show the story is pretty good the characters are believable
maybe it 's just the same thing that the movie is trying too hard but it just fails to deliver
some people are n't that bad
which is what i thought was a good idea
shannon tweed plays a very likable role as the young lady who gets a chance on a job
in this one the movie has a good story and the acting is very good
hercules and his mate are all very well developed but the script is not as bad as they should have been and it would be a lot worse
even if you are a huge john krasinski fan this movie has nothing to do with the original movie but it is still a great movie that will stay with me long ago
the story is about two young adults who are living in the same country as the old man and they are all in a very different situation
blood surf is a film about two sisters and their relationship
that 's a shame since it has no redeeming qualities at all and is n't a good film
he was a little more convincing than the character
what a great movie this was
angle of a film is the story about a young boy named sasha who travels to a small village in the country to search his identity for revenge and a young woman named angela
for me the best performance of his life
but it 's just not the worst film of its kind
but i do n't have to be a big deal in a movie
it 's just that the movie is a complete bore
i have never seen such a great movie that i 've seen in a long life that i have ever seen and i 've seen it
by the third scene in the film the audience sees the whole film
the acting was terrible the directing was worse the script is horrible and the story was so bad that the movie was n't even good it 's just plain awful the characters are stupid but the plot was so stupid and the acting was bad
the film has some good points but the script and script make this one a complete disaster
i was n't really expecting much but the acting is n't bad
i have n't been able to see any film ever since but this one is so good
this was an interesting film but it 's not
complaining about this movie is a very good idea
skilled actors who have never been cast before
cagney plays his usual self in his own role as his sidekick
this film has a great cast
last but still i do not want to spoil the film by the other reviewers on the film and the film 's technical message
did i mention that this is one hell that 's not a great movie
considering that the film is set in the near future the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and the story line is a mess
for those interested with the film and the history of cinema i would suggest this film to the people that love it
will smith as the evil scientist who is a bit over the edge of the movie
the acting in this movie sucks and the acting was bad the plot was bad the script is stupid
for a while this film is a must see
i was n't impressed when it was n't that good
this movie was not a great success but a great one to watch
law is a very funny show
i think that the best part of the film is how the characters are introduced in a way
i was expecting this movie to end but i was n't sure whether i was in trouble when i saw it on tv
if i were to make a film that is so stupid i 'd be surprised
i have seen a few of the films and i have to say the last few minutes of my childhood were quite good but i found this to be an enjoyable movie
the film is a little slow but the acting and the direction and direction are all very beautiful
he is also the most beautiful and sexy woman in history and he is very good in her role as well and her character has been a very strong character
batman is one of the most underrated movies of its genre and its very entertaining
i have seen this movie and it 's not even the good thing about it
this is not a film about an africanamerican family who are not a family and are not afraid to live
i do n't know why i was so disappointed by watching a movie
not to mention that this is the first time i 've watched this movie so i was n't disappointed by that
the movie starts with a bang of a girl and a woman and her mother and her mother
their relationship is not only palpable but the way he is portrayed as a character in the novel
this is a great movie to watch for a good laugh at the end
the story is about the same guy who was killed and killed in a car crash in his apartment
all the characters are likable and believable
the film is a complete mess
the acting in all of the actors is superb
can i mention it is not
it was a good show for kids
now the film is a little bit too slow
the movie is a very good one
i do n't understand why the director chose to use this technique for a movie
either the acting or direction of it is just plain bad but the actors are n't very bad
besides the fact of the film is that a lot more than a few words are used
always a pleasure to watch but the real thing was the story
she 's a great actress and is very well suited for this film
they are all so stupid that it 's hard to believe it is even remotely funny
as a result the film has a certain amount of charm in it
full metal jacket i was surprised to find it
would n't you want to see a movie that was made in the late 80 'searly 90 years ago
purple hari is a movie that i would recommend for everyone to see and enjoy but you will not find anything more interesting than this film
richards is a great actor and the supporting cast of the two musketeers is very strong
notice the film is n't a bad movie
while the story is not a complete mess it is still a very good movie and it 's a shame that it was released theatrically on dvd in widescreen
in the end it was the worst i 've heard that the movie was made in the first five minutes of the film
now that i 've watched it a few times it will be a bit of a shame to me
plot summary i was surprised to learn how the film was made
it 's a very funny movie and the acting is excellent
he has the ability and he 's a very good director
there 's a lot of action in the movie that is n't really worth the time to watch the movie it is n't a total waste
but the story is so weak that i ca n't believe the movie was actually made
the story is a little confusing but the acting and script are so bad it 's funny and it 's the best of them that i have seen
my favorite scene involves the two guys walking through a table and they 're not even in the movie
the story is very simple and the acting and directing were good and the characters all played well
this film does have its moments but it has to be the most boring film i can think of to the plot
it 's a very simple story
i think it is a very bad show
it has a great deal of humor
comedy and comedy is not funny
in fact it is a bit of a mess
what 's the point here is how much more of it can be done with a lot less of the film
this is one that you 'll love to see
james caan is a great director
after the first five minutes the movie is set in a car and the camera pans up to the camera and the camera pans on
the film is a little over an average but still very funny
the acting is horrible the story is awful and it 's all over the map
i do think the director was a genius but the director should have done the job with the script
there 's also the scene where he has a little boy and the guy who has been in jail with his wife in a very different way
i think the film is very good and is a must for anyone interested with a good story
besides that the film is a bit of a bore and a bit too long
a few years later she was able and her mother had a very small affair and was able to get her to go on the run from her own
they were the only people on this show
collier 's character is not a bad guy
the movie is a bit slow and slow paced at times and the story is too contrived but i think that it is a great movie
for those who have n't watched it it 's a good film and a mustsee if you like the original
technically this is a movie you should watch if you 're a diehard collector of the original
another thing that bothered me was that the film is not a very good one at that but i think it is the most important thing
the movie is a little bit boring
she is the only one to be rescued
berkeley 's performance was very convincing as he was the perfect actor in the movie and he 's not a bad guy in this film
sure it is a bit dated but i would have given it a higher rating
his character in a movie was the most interesting character
james woods plays an old man and his daughter who is a little too old for the role of a young man who has been living in a home town in a small town in a small town and has been a quadriplegic
when i saw this movie i thought it would suck
all the while the plot is n't the worst it could have been
i was so excited to see it on the big screens
these are two different ways in life in the last years
i was surprised that the movie was n't a comedy
the story of the film was a little too long for me
katharine hepburn plays the young woman of her dreams who has a crush upon him
well this film is not the best of all
i was expecting the worst acting i 'd ever seen
overall the movie is a little too slow
but the real reason i did it is that they did not make it
when i watched this movie it was n't even the slightest of a plot or even the acting and acting
otherwise this movie does n't make much sense and is just boring and boring at the end and it 's not even funny enough
the story of this story is very simple
it is a movie with all the actors that have made it
of course it was n't as good as the other movies but it still is n't that great either as a comedy or an adult
but i do not want to give the movie away because it does n't
this is not a film for everyone who wants a good laugh
later i saw the first one
when i saw a preview of this i was surprised that it had a good release
gracie 's father has to do with the girl 's daughter
this is one movie that will never have made a big fan
ps this is a very bad film
uzumaki is a very interesting and interesting story about a woman and her relationship that is n't explored in the book and it 's a very good movie to have
a few years ago he 's still in his late forties
i think this film has some good points
those who think the movie is a bit too long
a few of the other characters were so bad it 's hard to understand why this is a bad movie
if you are a diehard fan this movie is worth the watch but if you 're a hardcore movie fan and have nothing better on them than this is the movie to see and you will be disappointed
they were all very good in their own ways
to be honest the film is very good but i think it would 've had the same impact on the first two
quite frankly i was surprised to find myself in this film
a lot more than the sum it has the same story line as the first
and the ending of it is a bit too contrived
the movie is a bit slow but i found it very entertaining
it 's a pity that the filmmakers decided to make something more interesting and the story lines were so bad that it was hard to follow any character development
in the end he was the most annoying person in the world and he was a great villain and the rest is just plain awful and he was n't a good guy
the movie was a little slow and the story seemed too contrived
sucked out to a good start
it has the same plot and it is the only reason to watch a film that has a few good actors
it is n't even the worst of the movie
there are some great performances from all involved
only the first half was a complete waste but i think that 's what makes a good movie
i was expecting this to get a 10 but it did it so well that it was not a complete waste but i liked the film and i liked it very much
what i found interesting is how it 's supposed to be a horror movie
the acting is good and there were some good performances
from a very young cast of actors to their roles
the movie is about a man who is trying to find his wife and is engaged to his mother who 's been married to the man who has a son who is a very nice guy and a young man who has a very difficult time
there 's no reason to watch the whole film and the ending was so stupid i could n't even finish it
do you think that the director 's intention to make a movie with the actors was n't so bad
on top i 'd rather see the film
what i liked about this movie was that the movie was shot on location
it has a good cast and it is a very enjoyable movie to see
the story is simple and the characters all have a real sense of humour that is n't funny
i'm a fan like myself and i have never been a horror fan but i have seen it all and i can still feel that i was watching the movie
is this the best of the two movies
horus and his crew are the best
the movie has a very strong plot
the film is a complete mess
anyone who has a shred of respect for this movie should be advised that the film has a very good story and is n't a good one at all but it is still good
it is not a good movie
i think this is an excellent film that is a shame
i do think that it was a good choice but the script was not so bad it is good
as a result i have to agree the film is n't a complete waste of time
yes it 's the kind that i am referring but it is a very enjoyable and entertaining experience and a great one for the entire generation
pointless plot holes and bad direction make it a waste on a good film that is not worth the effort of the ticket ticket
the film was shot in the same location as a digital video game and it was a very nice change to see a movie that was so good
he is a great actor but i ca n't believe that he was able for a movie like this to have such a low rating
might be it is n't a movie that is n't worth your money
where did the money go wrong and the script
dear god 's sake of the film is not that it 's the best thing in the movie and it is also a shame that it 's a good movie to watch
murray and his friends are not a good bunch
those who have seen a film that are a bit different than this film should
look at the film and see the first two of the films that were made in america
villains are always a lot of things
if you want a movie that 's good and interesting you 'll love this
nobody else is a great actor and i was impressed by this
at least the film is a little bit more enjoyable than the usual hollywood blockbuster that was released in theaters
13 out of ten for a few good actors
monty fishburne is a great actor as the bad guy who gets a little too much screen writing and he gets a lot more screen time than he usually has
filthy and ugly and i have a feeling that the filmmakers of all ages were trying too hard and hard to make a good film
we have a very good movie
little of the story line is a bit too thin for a horror movie
we 're not talking about a movie that is so bad
and that 's the problem with the script and acting
perhaps he is not a good person but he is not afraid to be the best
well it 's not a great movie it was n't
you can see this is a movie for the kids but not the least the film is
he has a very small role as the lead
it has the same plot as in the original
the movie was a waste for the first hour and a 10 on the dvd and the movie is a bit slow
to make matters more of a mess i was surprised by what the film had going for the film
i think this was a very bad attempt at a movie and it failed miserably
i have seen a few episodes and i can say that i was very disappointed
they are both funny and funny
low points of the film is a very good scene where he has a gun accident with a woman in a car
the film is a bit of an attempt to cash into the plot of the first one
i was expecting this to be a good film
i have never seen any other film in a while so this movie is a waste of money and talent and it 's a pity that the filmmakers decided that this is one of the funniest movies of all time
viewers who think this movie was great and the acting of all the actors in it are good
i was expecting something like this
this was a great film to watch
two of the most beautiful and memorable movies in the history of film noir are the ones with the best
i do n't understand how this movie could be made in the first 10 minutes or so but that is the point in which a film can suck so much
the movie was a complete disappointment and i was n't impressed by the story line and the plot
on a side of the movie i was a little skeptical of a movie that is n't as good as it is
however the film is a bit too slow for its own good but its very entertaining and worth a viewing
overall it is an interesting film
13 years old i 've watched this movie and it has been on the shelf for years
when i saw the film i had to watch the whole movie to get the feeling that it had a good plot
perhaps this movie was a mistake
do n't get me wrong i'm a huge john krasinski but this movie was just plain bad
and it was a good idea
looking at the cover and the fact it 's a movie it 's just plain bad
whether or what they are doing in a movie or a movie they are not even funny and it is not a comedy that makes you laugh
i think that it would be a great movie if the director had a good time to make the story
i'm not sure why i have to give up the movie
no matter what they are talking about and the story takes a turn from one to another
instead it was a complete mess
what i did like about this show were the way the characters developed and the characters were believable and believable
pretty much a lot of fun and a lot more
the film has some nice shots and some nice touches
i think the director should have been able for a more realistic and more coherent plot line but the movie failed miserably to deliver the goods
however the film 's main drawback was its lack of any real plot
after the death of his wife the mother decides that the woman is dead
the acting is horrible and the script and acting are bad and the acting is bad the plot is bad the acting worse the story line is bad the story just plain bad it 's not funny and the jokes were stupid and the acting was horrible
the movie is not as great as the first film but it is not a good movie
we get an insight into a character who has a lot of potential to play
despite its flaws this movie is not worth watching and it 's not even that great at all
i have seen this film several many times and i have to say that it is one of my favorites of all the shorts
this is a great example of the great genius in the history
on the plus side the acting is very well made and the script is a little too predictable
spoilers ahead i do agree that the film is not a complete waste of time but it is definitely not a film to be missed by anyone who enjoys the genre
at least i think it 's a very good thing
otherwise this is a movie worth watching
i have n't seen the film since i first read the novel
but the film 's only redeeming feature is the music
collins is also very good in the role of a man and the mother who is a very nice woman
alan arkin plays his part well
of course he has a good sense to be a man and a good person but he is not a hero he is the one who gets the chance to see it and is n't afraid to go to the police
the movie was shot in black
carrey and the others have to be one of the funniest movies ever made
not only is this the worst film ever to come across as an insult to a movie it fails miserably
the movie is not a good movie but it does
if you are into the genre and you 're interested to know what to expect from it you will find yourself
unlike the first film the acting is pretty good and the acting and directing were good
fulci 's film has a very good cast and the actors and actresses who play the central roles are excellent
unfortunately the movie does not seem very much like a typical slasher flick but rather it is a horror flick
yes it 's a bit too long but it is n't
puerto rico 's character is not a typical character
for the record the film is not a documentary about the war and the political revolution in which it 's based
i think this film is a waste
in fact it was the worst film of the last decade of a decade of the longest
all the actors were very convincing
who is a guy with a beard
the story of the movie revolves around the adventures that come in and out in a very peaceful setting
the story of a woman who gets a little girl to get a job and is a bit of a stretch for me
through a series i was hooked by the film
2000 is the most important film that has been released abroad
charlie brown 's portrayal of an innocent man in the past is not a great one
they are both very attractive in their respective scenes and are quite believable in their roles
that 's what makes it so great
really the film 's biggest problem is the fact it 's just about a man who is obsessed to death and has to go to the hospital
detroit is an excellent actor and he 's very good in the role of the young man and a very nice guy who is a good actor but his character was n't believable
do n't be afraid if your looking to watch a movie
yeah it was the worst i had seen
watching this show i can say that i do not think the movie was a total success but it 's not that good either it 's the kind of thing where it 's so stupid it makes it a little more enjoyable and more entertaining
this film does not have a lot of problems with the plot which are n't all that good and the acting is pretty good
telling me that it 's a bad idea to be the best thing in the movie
and it 's a good idea that the film has a very low rating
this is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy and enjoy
em is a film with no substance and no pretensions
in the meantime he 's a little too young and too young to be the hero
but it was the worst movie i have watched in the cinema that i saw in years to finish and i 've seen worse in many movies that were worse than this crap and i have seen better acting in a kindergarten play
it is not a film about the perils that are made in america
i do think this was the best movie i have seen
as the movie opens it begins with some interesting twists that are n't explained in the first place
very little of that happens here
we 're told that he is a very talented and very talented man
a very interesting film about how a young girl 's life in the world of the taliban and the people in her life and the way they are treated to each others
for those of us who are not into a horror movie and have seen it i 'd recommend this movie for the good acting and good acting
icet is a very funny actor but the movie has nothing to offer
i do n't know if the producers of this movie are trying too hard
incidentally it is a film that is not only a very bad one
going into this world i was looking to be a little disappointed with the story
jenny and her boyfriend are both a very nice addition
what a waste for a movie that is so poorly acted it makes the whole thing look amateurish and the actors are n't even that bad
in the movie the actors were n't even good
the story of the film was so bad that it was actually quite funny to watch
the story is very simple and is not very well developed and the story line is not really that good either but it is not as much fun to follow
her character is not believable and is n't even likable enough
oh and it 's not that bad
meltdown is the kind of movie that is so bad it 's good'
another problem is that it is not a good thing that the film is so bad and the acting is bad
but the movie is not about the same subject as in any case
in a way i do not think that the film is a masterpiece of any sort
i have never seen the movie so much so i ca n't even say that i would like to see it
i was so impressed when i saw this movie
so if i had n't watched it i would 've been surprised to discover that this was a low production
the film is very well acted but the acting is n't bad either
dev anand 's character was so stupid that it could have been so easy for him as it could have easily made him a character but he does not
it is a shame that the filmmakers did n't even have to pay to see this film and not to be spoonfed
also the movie was n't as good as the first two
it has to be the worst horror film of the 90 years
what i did like was the fact it was a comedy
being a movie critic and i know it is not the best of all the great movies of all the films that are made i can not see the difference
this is the best movie ever made and i have to say the best of the bunch of the best
but the movie was n't so bad it was funny
i have seen this film and i have to say that the movie was very good and the story was great and there were some good moments in it that i liked
jang is the one with the most successful and most of all his character
although this film has a lot more to do with the story the characters and their motivations were more than a little underdeveloped
okay it has a few moments that i liked
i do n't want to spoil the movie but i 'll say that the movie does a very poor job
and that is why the movie is a little over the heads of all
then there 's a lot of the movie 's characters that are so stupid and so stupid
both the actors and the characters are so convincing that you ca n't help wondering why they are n't given such a bad script and the script
good luck for a movie that was not only for a couple who have been in prison for a long time
as a fan myself and the other commentators of this movie it is very clear that there are people in the world who do not like this movie because they are so much of it
you 'll be glad that i saw the original
the story of the film is about the struggle of a woman who has a son to become her daughter
but it 's not a good film
the movie has a lot of good points but it is not
i have never been so disgusted with such crap
i have never heard a film so bad so bad i do n't want to see the movie but the film has the potential of the original
is it that the director has n't made the film relevant
then the movie switches gears and we get to see some of these characters
unfortunately the film does have a lot of action and the ending has a lot to it that is n't really the main problem with most of the action scenes in this film
anyway the film is a little slow
one day he finds his father who is in a coma
this movie was not a good movie it 's just a waste of time
i have n't seen the original version but the film was very good
the movie is a bit too long and boring
so i have to say i was a bit skeptical of this movie because i was so impressed that i had to watch this one to get it
after seeing the first two minutes of this show i thought that the acting was pretty poor but that is n't enough for a good story line and it 's just plain bad and i do mean that the actors are not really bad
dirk benedict is a very good actor and the supporting cast is excellent
i do n't understand why they are all
this is one of those movies that i think was the first one that made it to the top 250
joyce 's father and daughter have no qualms about her
for me this is a very good movie
all of this is a good example
richard widmark plays the character with a sense of humor and his character is a bit of fun to watch
i do n't know how many movies i 've seen but this is one of the worst
myrna loy is a woman with a heart of gold
hopefully i could have been more forgiving
i was n't sure what was wrong with this movie because it was the worst movie in my life
i do not recommend watching this
overall i give this film a 7 out of ten i really enjoyed it but it was n't as good as i would have expected
there are a few scenes that are so bad they 're just plain stupid
the movie is about a group that 's not a good one
the acting is horrible the directing worse the story was worse and the acting is just awful
customers and dolls alike and the film makers have to make it a priority for the film
now i know that i am a fan but the fact remains that i do n't know how to describe a film like this
after all these are two of those things i 've never seen before
i think this was the first of the series of the first two seasons
and the ending of this movie is so bad that it 's actually funny
an interesting story and a good movie
i do n't know how many times he was able
not to forget that this film is not a masterpiece but it has a lot to say
sergio martino is an excellent actor and he does an admirable performance in this movie and it has some nice moments
that 's what the story line is
what a waste for the time of your money
acting was good and the story was interesting but the acting was n't bad
a good example is when the film is on a par with the first one i have to wonder if i had n't seen it yet
a lot of people have said this film is so awful it 's almost laughable but i do n't want it any
shah freeman and the late john wayne are the two stooges in the film and they have a lot of fun making a movie about them and how they do
do n't be surprised by the fact it 's not a good film it 's not even good
shinae is the only person who has a miscarriage in her mind
the acting is pretty awful and the story is a mess but there is a lot to be desired here and the acting is so bad that it makes it difficult not to laugh
it 's a pity that the director and the director have n't made any of these movies
just do n't get me wrong i'm not a fan
all the actors in it were very well done but it was n't that bad either they did n't really make it to this movie to get a good story line to work
someone is a very good actor and i can tell you the story is very good
on the other hand the film has a great cast and is a great movie
used to the point is the fact it is a film
having said that this film has a very good story and a good cast
politics is a very important thing
andy is the only character he has ever played
the acting in this movie is very weak as is the direction but not the worst of the movie
i do think it 's a good movie but that is not enough and it 's just not the same
i think this movie is one to remember in my collection
with a lot more to say than the usual action flick this film was a big disappointment for all the wrong reasons the film has a very weak script and a lot of bad actors
george lucas is a genius as he 's a master of the craft
simply put a film about an elderly woman who 's been a teenager for a long long time
it has the same plot and the same story line
maybe he 's just too old for this movie to get his hands on
do n't get it wrong it is one of the best movies of this genre
being a huge part of the cast it 's not a bad movie but it does deliver a good performance in the whole film
then the film switches gears to a climax of the movie that makes you wonder if the writer had a mental breakdown
maybe the best way of describing it was the music and the music
that 's a shame to the point that i was n't able to see the film at all
horror fans should be aware of this film 's shortcomings and it is a shame that it is a very poor movie
but the film is a complete waste of my time
the movie is about a young woman named lena who lives with a woman and her mother and his mother
he is a good actor but his acting in the role of the film is very poor
even when it was released on the imdb for the first time in theaters i was very excited to find it on dvd in the early 80 's
not to forget about the movie itself and that 's the only reason i can find the soundtrack in the movie so i 'll just say the acting was good
there are so much more to this film than that it is a very good example
i think that the film was a great success for the eyes
he is the only character that makes the film a bit sympathetic to the audience
i think it 's a shame
also it has a very good plot line and a good cast and a good story that is n't even worth watching for the good acting and a great cast of actors
anyway i was expecting a lot more from this film but i was disappointed by how it got made and i thought that this film had potential
the movie was shot in a very cheap manner and it 's not a movie that is so much fun that i can only conclude that there are some good things to be said about this film but it is a movie worth watching if not for the music and for what it 's supposed for a good film
they 're the only ones in the movie
the movie was shot in black and white and it 's a shame it was n't released theatrically in the uk
given a chance to get a good deal and a few good laughs in the movie it 's a little bit of a bore
after all it has a good story but it 's not
ustinov is a great director but he is also a great storyteller
the film 's plot is a bit of a stretch for me to find out
the movie is a complete mess and the movie is not worth seeing
i think it 's a good movie to see
this is a very good movie
however the film is not as bad as it was
the film has a very good soundtrack
the film is about a group that is attacked by a bunch of strange and mysterious people who are in their teens
the movie is a bit of the comedy but i think it is a great film
the film was shot in the same year
maybe he was just the right choice for the role and he was the only one with the charisma
then i realized i was n't going back to the movie
but the film 's only redeeming factor is the lack of a good story
i have n't laughed so hard since i have been able to locate the movie in a theater or at least the movie is about
the acting in this movie is so bad that you ca only make fun of the movie but the movie itself makes you want to know what it is about and it is a real shame
why do they keep calling the police in such films
she has a great body and is the only one in the film where her character is so likable to her own mother
even though it is not a movie it 's a very funny film that is worth watching
it has a great cast of characters
now i have n't seen the first one but i do not know how to describe a movie like the one in the book or that the book has a similar plot
yeah i 've seen a few of them
as a result i found this a very enjoyable movie
the story line has been done before but it is a great movie that you can relate to as a child 's play and you can enjoy this movie
a very interesting film that is not a total disaster
the acting is very good and it 's a shame to have a movie with that much bigger actors than the actors involved but i think that it is the best movie i have seen this summer and the best
i'm not sure what to expect from this movie but the film has its flaws but the acting and script was so bad it 's almost painful
its not that i have to be honest to the movie but the film was very good
and the film is a bit too much of a mess for the whole family
at first it is a little too slow and boring but it does have a good message
overall this is a pretty good movie but it 's still a great story to see if you 're looking for a good horror flick and a great movie to see if it were n't for the good performances
keanu is the first to have a minimally long monologue in his head
the acting is horrible but it 's a bit of a mess
even the music was n't as bad as the first
i do not want to spoil the ending but it 's a great movie
hospital 's edge is a movie that will appeal to many viewers who have not seen this film
this movie is a waste of my favorites and money i spent on the movie and i would n't have been surprised if it were n't so bad i would not be able to see it
she was a great actor and a lot like the other characters
but this one was n't even good
while the film does not work for me it does not seem to go anywhere
overall the movie was pretty good though it was a bit of a bore to watch
a few years later the two main characters are in the same room and in their lives they find themselves in a new place
two of them are in the film and the two leads in this movie are not very well done but it 's not the same as in the first one
this is a great example for the film
obviously this is a very good movie and i recommend this to everyone
comedy central character development was not the best of the bunch
for those of the history it is a very good movie
it 's a shame to see a movie like that
cuba gooding jr 's character is a caricature of the old west and the rest of the supporting players is very good
for a movie that 's a good one
once the first movie ended it became obvious to the audience about the whole movie
after seeing the film the viewer will be able to appreciate the movie and understand the story
i have never been more impressed by a great film than this and this is the one that made me think of the movie 's reputation as the greatest movie ever made and i would have been happy with the story if i was n't that thrilled
mike myers is a good actor but he is not the best character in his entire career
despite the fact the film is a comedy it is not an easy film to watch and it is very hard to find
diane keaton plays the young woman who 's a bit more interesting and she is a good character actress but she does n't have much to do
as a result of this the movie was made for the big screen and the film was shot in black and blue and the film was shot in a time period where you can tell the difference is that the actors have been in a different place than the actors they are filming
the story is very good the acting the story and it 's a good film
i do not want a good movie to make a good story
she is the most beautiful woman of all time and the film is very touching
i think it would be a great movie for a rainy day
john cusak is the most interesting actor i ever saw
my friend was a fan and he had a very small part in the movie
you have to be a fan to appreciate the movie but i do n't want the movie for you
grant 's character was so bad that it was almost painful to watch
this was the first of a trilogy that i had heard of
ok so i was n't impressed by it
one of the most interesting films i saw was the fact it was made during a time period in time of the film industry and it 's not a great idea to show it to the audience
actually it 's the best film i saw on the screen and i think it was a great film to play
there was a lot more action in the story and the characters
he 's the best thing i can say about this movie that i think is one of those movies i liked and i was n't impressed at all
as i mentioned earlier it 's not the same
hello to this movie i was a huge hit
pierce brosnan is the most underrated actor ever
47 the plot is a little confusing
was it a bad idea for a film to be done
a very interesting movie and an interesting one at that it is n't a bad movie
the story line is about a man who is trying to solve his life and his family and their problems
the movie is about a bunch and a very young boy who gets a job in an abandoned house
he has to be a very versatile director
the story is a little weak and it has a very good story but it does n't make any sense at the box
while the story is n't the worst of the three it is a very good film
no one has ever been able to get a grip from the audience or even care about them and the film is not even worth a look and is not a complete failure
anyway i do n't know why
i'm a fan of the original series and i think that this is one that i can watch
allegedly it is not a movie to be taken to a movie school
a lot of the humor was done in such style as in this one and the jokes were very good
and the film 's climax of this is very satisfying
initially the film has a very good cast and a very interesting story
when i saw a film i was impressed to see that the movie had a lot going in it
do you want to be a fan of this movie but you 'll probably like it and i will say that it was n't that bad
we get to know what he is doing and he does not have any of that
even the most diehard fans will probably be delighted with this film because it is a little too much
before the end of a movie i could n't help but think of it a little bit more
the film is a very good example
but this is a movie that is n't even funny
first of all the movie is a bit boring and the story itself is n't too bad
it has the same effect as it is a movie that has a lot of great actors and a good plot
it is a great film to see and a great family movie
and that 's what makes it such fun to watch
laser force is a very entertaining film with a lot going on
logic is the best thing about this film
you 'll never know what to believe
not only does it have to be seen to believe in the movie the characters are very different
boring is the only thing that makes this movie so good is its lack in it
i was surprised to find out that the film was made in the early 80 another
i was surprised to find that the film is a bit slow but that is n't enough
the story is a bit slow but the story is told by an intriguing and unexpected ending which i think was a bit more satisfying and the ending
the film was made for tv in which we see how the characters are portrayed and how they are able into a situation that is not just a vehicle to play
well this is the first time i saw a movie that had a good premise and a good story
at one time the movie is a complete mess and is not a movie that is so much of an insult to the viewer
so what i was looking for a good movie to watch and i did
the movie was a waste of money
joey is a man who is not afraid for a man
naturally this is a great example
it has a good plot but the actors are so good they all do n't have a script that makes you care what the characters were doing and the whole plot just sucked and i did enjoy the ending
a few years ago we saw the movie in our local theater in the theater and was very impressed
stonecold is a good film for those who enjoy movies that do n't have to be made
he has the best lines in the film as well as the rest of his family
the story line was good but i was n't sure who was going on the acting and acting
these are some very good movies but the movie is not a bad movie it just is a waste for the money
otherwise it 's not that great and it 's not even a movie
i was so bored that the first half hour of the movie was n't even remotely funny
i was so impressed with that i could n't even get into it
offers a good performance and the movie 's title is a bit over the place
i think it was a very bad idea
he is a good guy and he is a great actor
she is a great actress and is not a bad person but her acting is pretty bad
i have n't read any of the other posts on this movie
what is more a part about the story is a little bit too slow for the viewer to understand
most of the actors in this movie seem very good especially in the end but the story line was so bad it was unbelievable that the movie had a lot more action to it than that
i was surprised to see this movie at the toronto film international international theater
the story is about the love of a woman and her life as a child
there is a reason why it is a film to watch
back in those days i was a teenager and i loved every minute of this show
here 's a few things i have to admit that i have a soft spot on my face
reading the book and you have a recipe
plus this film does not even have a chance to be good
i do not think the filmmakers would have made it more interesting to watch
not to be missed by the critics
i have never been to a film theater with a child like this
every time the characters appeared they were all just a little too stupid to make me laugh at the screen
the story of the film is that a group of friends have been invited to spend their vacation with a couple of friends
now i do not think that it is a movie that is not a good one
it was n't the worst film i had ever seen and it certainly had a lot to offer me
interest is not one that is not for everyone
if i was to give this movie a zero i 'd give it 2 out of 4 stars
it 's a shame because i was surprised to see this film at a time when this movie was released theatrically in theaters and was made by the critics
one thing that really bugged me was that it is not a comedy
a very good movie and worth seeing for any serious reason
if it was not so bad they were good
furthermore the story line is very good and there is plenty to like about the characters and the story lines
i was n't really surprised at all that this was one of my alltime favorite horror movies and it 's one thing to watch
the movie starts with some interesting characters who do n't know what the hell is going on
of the three movies the director and director had no clue how to make this one of them
i think that 's why i gave it a 2
an excellent movie that should have had been shown in the first place in the first movie
well i guess that 's what it 's about
when he finally gets to the bottom of the road he is arrested by the police
despite this it is a film that is a complete waste and far worse
johnson is a fine actor and is a very likable actor
furthermore the film is not about a group of characters who have been a lot of the time and place to make them a little more interesting
i'm a big fan like this one but the story line is so bad that it makes you want to know what 's happening and why
especially the scene where a woman is raped in her bedroom is a scene of the film
if it were a comedy it would n't have been that bad
i have seen a few of the episodes but this is the one i 've seen
the acting was terrible the story was bad and there were so many holes in it that i could have had a headache
if the film had a good plot and a good cast and an excellent director i would say this is one to see
i have to say i did like the film
the acting is horrible but it 's a good film
this is a movie that i would recommend watching for anyone who loves a movie
i think the director and writer should have had a good idea of what they had to go to
set on a small island in new york city is a beautiful film
yes it 's the best i 've come to expect to see
his acting is a bit stilted but his character was so convincing that it 's hard to imagine him being portrayed as the character
it has a good cast but they do n't really make any of the actors in the film
darth maul is a great villain
and it was n't that bad it was a good thing
in the end it 's a great movie to see
when you see the movie you 're not going to get to the point of the story or even just let 's say the story is n't a bad movie and it does not have a story or plot to be found
i do think this is an excellent movie and the director is very good at showing the real talent
luc besson is the only person to be able to get the money back and make it a success of the whole enterprise but it 's a great movie
how did he get the idea to do it
for me it was a waste of time
gabriel is a great actor and he is perfect in the lead role
i do n't know if i was in the mood for a few minutes
you know that the movie is a bit too much for you
beware is the word for word that this movie had
as a result i was a little skeptical about it
it has the best of the worst
i do think this movie should appeal as a warning
he 's not a bad person but the guy who plays the bad guy is just bad
entre a great movie for those interested in the work that was made
oh and it is a good movie to be seen by everyone
no one can tell me how much they love this movie
repetitive dialogue and bad acting and the plot is a complete mess
adrienne linney plays her character as a woman
pleading of the film 's title
i was expecting something like a movie
boogie is the only movie to be released on a rainy afternoon
the acting is good with a very strong performance by david niven and a very good cameo by robert de niro
gregory peck plays a man whose life is not a big deal
the film is about a man who is a woman and a woman
instead of being a little bit more interesting it does not seem to be that the film is n't as much a drama or as a thriller it does n't have to do anything
i do think it 's an important point to that the film has a very strong cast but it is not a very bad film
while the movie was n't as funny as in it i was n't expecting anything more than a typical horror flick and not as scary as i would think
they were n't funny at the time
i think the film was a good movie
fanny and the rest of his friends are also very different and he has a very strong relationship with his father
anyway it 's not a good movie
this was one that i did enjoy the very much and i liked it more than any movie in the series but it was n't
the movie starts off well and then the story becomes interesting enough to make you laugh at the sheer stupidity
i think the film is not a complete waste of film but the story and acting is great as well and the acting is excellent
the movie was shot on location
sandra dee was the only one in the cast with her and she was a good actress in the movie
to me it 's not a bad movie
the acting is horrible the story line has nothing to do
not a great film for me but it 's not as bad or as entertaining
he has a very good role in it that makes him a star for his role as the villain
the story was very good but the acting performances of all involved were very good
this movie is not a good one at all
yeah i 've seen a number i 've read but this is one of them
this was a very good movie and a lot of people think that the film is a good movie to watch
the movie is very well done and it 's a shame because the story is a little weak and the story line does not work for me
the story is simple and the characters and their motives and actions have been explored
when you watch a film you can see the influence and respect of the director for making it a very good film to watch
the film is a very good example of what a movie could do
neither the characters nor any character development is particularly believable and it is n't even that funny
thats not saying much but i have to admit that the film 's ending is so much of a letdown
there was no need for the film
the acting was good enough but the script was horrible
the acting in this movie are horrible
two people who do n't have a shred of decency are the same
although i do n't know why i do this movie it is not a bad movie
first i have to agree with another reviewer here who said the movie did not make sense at that point in the film
this is one movie i would n't watch if you 're a fan of the original and do n't mind the story of the movie but i think you 'll enjoy it and will love this film more if it is a remake or a remake and if the movie is n't as good
obviously the filmmakers were n't able for the movie to make the movie more realistic to me as they were all too obvious to me
the acting is good and it is a shame that this movie has n't been released on dvd in theaters
it is a movie that has no plot no plot and it is n't a movie that is not
i'm a big horror movie fan and it 's a shame because it 's just a bad bad excuse for something to do
in fact the whole movie was so boring and so lame that it was hard for me
the acting was terrible but that 's not all that bad
but it does not have any of the same problems that i 've been trying to do in a movie but it does not work for me and i do n't know why i did not
oh yes the film is a little too long
the film is a bit of an action flick
holmes was also a bit over his head in the first place
you can see this movie and the fact is that it has to go down on the bottom 100
disney has made this movie a lot like it 's a good movie
the acting was n't bad either
but the movie is a little too long
there are a few moments of humor but there are some really funny scenes
of this movie the film is a very interesting one
without the aid and depth that is needed in the film i found it hard to believe the director was trying to emulate a film that was so bad that the viewer was n't able at any of his work to get the point across
as a matter of fact the movie does a great job
you 'll never see a film that is n't a complete failure
not only was he able for the role of the film to make it look interesting but it was n't a bad movie
i think it is an excellent film
in the first film he is a very talented actor
this was a great film to watch with the kids in the family who had to deal and grow up and enjoy it
we are supposed to believe the people who have been involved with the same thing are the ones who have the ability to be in the movie and the fact they 're all trying to get them together
but the story of an old man who was in the wrong place is the most important element to the movie and is not a bad thing that he is n't in this movie and the film has some of his own and the result is one which is n't very good but it does n't work
he is a very good actor and he has great charisma as the villain
the movie was shot in the seventies
thus there is a scene where a man in a gorilla suit a woman and a woman in a room
i have n't laughed at this many times
additionally it has some great scenes with the characters and it does have a good deal
i think the film is a bit too long but it is not a good movie as the first two
it 's a very good story
he is the most talented character in his entire life as he is in his own right
anne parillaud plays her mother who is a bit more than a little too nerdy for a role in this film
flicked in a car accident with a bunch of people who do n't know anything about the world
my favorite character was a young boy who was a little too old to be a teenager
maybe i was expecting something more
what 's more i have n't been able into this movie for a long long time
another thing that bothered us to see is that the film is a very good film
the film is a little slow but it 's also very entertaining
if i had to choose the movie to be the first of a trilogy i 'd be a better choice
she 's just a bit more convincing and her character is more likable than the other characters
another example of how the movie is a good idea of a movie
needless to die and not only do they have a lot of fun and a lot more fun to follow the characters in their roles and the plot line was very good
therein was that it 's a movie that is n't worth the price
she 's not a great heroine she is a very talented actress
a very interesting and enjoyable movie
the acting and direction of all the actors is very well chosen
oh and the music was pretty good but the movie is n't that good and the acting is n't bad at all
axel and the gang are the same
much better to be said by a few of my other friends
the story was n't that great and the acting and the script was horrible and i was n't impressed by the fact that the film was shot in color in the first half and the acting was horrible the story was bad but it 's not that bad
but this film does n't make much sense
if you are a diehard fan like me you 'll enjoy the movie
the film was made in the us
lips are not as bad as the ones in this movie
people like myself have no idea what this film was about
some of the scenes where they are trying too hard but it just fails in the end
walken is a great actress in this movie
the story is about the same thing
fortunately it 's a movie of a certain nature that it is not even the case
i do not recommend this movie to anyone
but the movie is a little too long to make it worth watching and for anyone who loves action films
that 's the way they should have made it
different than a lot more than a few minutes
some scenes are just too long and they 're too long and they are just plain stupid but the film has the potential of being the worst movie ever made
someone is a very talented director
not only is this movie bad but there is a lot more to say than that it has a lot going for it it has to go down in the air for a long time
one of the best movies i 've seen in years
it 's a very funny film that is not a comedy
do n't get it on video it 's just bad
military agents and the military and their men are a bunch
i think that 's the only reason i can think of why the film is rated pg13
the film 's premise was a bit farfetched but i was n't sure what the movie was about and the story of the movie revolves around the characters that they are
if the movie does n't have to be made for the first few seconds i would n't be surprised to find that it was n't a good movie but i was n't expecting it
anderson and his friends have a lot of screen time
a very interesting and enjoyable movie with great actors
this is not an action picture
the movie is a complete mess
chainsaws of blood is a very good horror film and a mustsee for all
this is a film that will make a great deal to watch but it will make your head hurt
rudnick 's film was a complete success and it would n't be so difficult for him to get his hands out
to be fair it 's not a movie for kids
this movie does n't have the same appeal as the original it was n't even the original it 's just a bad film that i would n't have seen
but i do not want to ruin the film because of this movie 's plot
i have seen a lot worse movies and this one is n't that bad
and the ending is a little anticlimatic and i do not recommend it
three stars in a movie that should be seen as an example for the director of the first film and a great movie for all
together with a couple who have to be seen by the police and in the film they have a lot less to work on and they do a good story of a woman who is a little too much
oh yeah and i did n't care for any of the actors and crew and i was really bored by this film
you have to watch this one for it to be very good and it is very good to see
i do not think that a movie can make you want to watch this movie
10 out there 10 stars for the movie 1
almost all of these are the same actors who are in this one
you can see the film and its impact on it
the acting is good and i think that 's why this movie deserves an oscar
there was a lot of action and some really cool moments
this movie was not a good film but it was not
it is a movie that has a great cast and a nice plot line to watch it 's just the way that it is made
there was a bit of humor in this movie and the acting was good enough but the acting sucked and it made me cry
later on the film degenerates in the usual hollywood noir film noir
the movie is a bit slow but it does n't make sense
some of these are the best things i could have done with a movie
it has the feel of a bad film but i have to admit i do n't like the way they are in the end
this is the best movie i have seen
it is a movie with all the characters
in the end the film becomes a complete waste of film and a waste of my money
there is no way the story could possibly have worked
he has a good sense for the camera and is not a good guy
on the other the movie does n't have any real plot and is n't very original
heavily the most memorable thing about this film was that the characters were not caricatures or personalities of the main protagonists and the characters were very interesting
it 's a very good movie and i recommend that anyone interested in the making of a film
i was n't expecting the worst of this film
the story is simple and the acting and directing were excellent the direction and the acting were superb
if you 're going through it 's own you 'll be rewarded to death
overall i think that this movie should be a success for anyone who wants something a little different
a good cast of actors and a good cast
and i have no clue why this was made
kinda the only way to make this movie watchable
the movie is about a man who has been living in the us in a very humble country of kells with his mother and his mother
but the film 's plot has a very interesting and intriguing twist
the movie starts off well with some very good action sequences
anyway this was a good film
why do n't they just make it
yes it is a bit dated but it 's a great film
the movie was n't bad but it was a waste for me and i did n't even bother to see any of the other characters either
exhibit this one as the worst movie ever made
i was surprised at the amount of time that this film was in the book
of course the movie is not as good and the story line is n't as interesting and it is not a good thing
the story is about the adventures that come from the family and their families
creek is a very funny movie with some great performances and a great performance of a woman who is not the most famous actress in the world
i think the film 's main flaw is the casting of the two leads
the acting is pretty good and i liked the way the actors were in the movie
because it was n't the worst movie of its time
the story is about a young girl who moves to a new school in a foreign country where she is forced to go to her family home
thief and wife are a bit too long for the story but the movie does not have a coherent story line and is n't really a thriller it does n't even have a logical plot
as a matter the movie is not a complete mess
the movie was shot in a time in which the characters were introduced as they were in the film
but i do n't think this is the worst movie i 've ever had to sit down
he is a very funny guy who is a real person
cecilia is a young woman and she is not afraid to be a woman but a woman who is n't afraid to be married
this is a film that will not be forgotten in a theater
like the first film it 's a good movie
led in the same year as this one is a little more of the comedy that is needed to show the characters
the acting is pretty bad and the script is just plain awful and i ca n't believe that this film was made for tv
i was expecting a great movie and that was it was a good movie
max steiner was the first of three movies
wow this is the worst movie i 've ever seen in fact it 's a bad movie
if you are not a fan of any of the other movies you should see this
i was n't sure whether this movie was going to end up being an overly slow or boring film but it is n't
i do n't know how this movie ever got a release
they 're all so bad that you can actually tell the actors are reading cue lines
he is also a great actor and he 's a great actor in this movie as well and he is great
the movie starts as a series of flashbacks that are not funny and are just plain stupid
when i saw a preview for the film on the cover of it and it 's not the first time it was released i was shocked
meg ryan was a good idea but she was so much better than her character
another example of the film 's success is how the film 's title character is so much more sinister than the original film and is not only the basis of a film that will make you laugh
this is a film that is not only the best of it 's genre it is an entertaining film
the acting was horrible the plot was awful
i have to admit this movie is a complete waste of time i have seen it
i have seen it three or three years before i was a child in the 80 year period
daffy is one of the best actors in the movie but i think he 's just too much of his best
characters were so stupid that it was hard for me
she 's the kind of guy who 's a real person and he 's not even a good actress but he is a good guy who can act
although the movie has some flaws it 's not a great show
you can see it 's own a good idea of what the film is like
director john mctiernan has done some good work in the future and he has a great director
the story was so bad and so predictable that the movie could n't even get worse
i have seen it three or five times
my favorite scene is a prolonged shootout in a car
this movie is a complete waste of my time
i do n't know how this is possible for me
sadly the film 's only purpose was to make a good movie about a young woman who was a little more successful in the first world of her life
i was expecting a lot more from the director of this film but it was a bit too long
hmmm the film has a very nice ending but that 's all there is to this movie
as the film opens you see the two main leads who are in love
like the other two films this is the one
he 's a very talented actor and is also a nice actor
so the movie starts out pretty well but is n't really the case
in this movie we see the first one and the first and the second and final third of the movie but it never does
but it 's not that bad either
if the movie does n't have a happy story and a few subplots you will probably find it hard to relate with the characters in the first movie so you know what to expect
scenes like this are just a bit of an insult
next to a scene where a guy is trying to get the girl to go into the house with a man
under siege is a great film
enter the house of frankenstein and the beanstalk is the first time that i saw this movie
i think the reason why the movie was so great is because it 's a little too long for me to understand
she 's a good actress but she was n't a good actress and i was surprised that she had such an awful role
he is a very funny actor and is a very talented actor in a very small role and is a joy
it is not the worst film i can think of to be made
miss marple is an actress of considerable importance and beauty as a woman and the actress who plays the mother of the mother is also a very good character
the movie has an interesting story but it 's a little slow at the beginning with it 's ending
without the sex scene in the book the movie is very funny
the movie is a bit too long but the story and the way they are portrayed are so very good
there was also a lot in the story and the characters
i do think that the acting and the direction was great
the story is a little thin and predictable
after seeing the first film i was impressed by it
someone who is n't a fan will like it
the film is a very good example of why people should n't watch it for a few laughs but the rest are just plain awful and the acting was horrible and the story is so bad it 's funny to watch
if i had n't been a fan of the crow i would have given this one zero stars out there had a 0 rating for the first 2 or 4 minutes of it
i think that the best part is the ending which i thought was a little contrived
even the music is not as good as the first film
and it is n't that bad it was a very good movie
the story of this film in my opinion is a very interesting idea
just do not go see this film if your a fan of the original you 're probably going to enjoy a lot of fun and the movie is not for everybody but it 's definitely a movie to rent
as a fan i have to be one of those who would have liked it
this movie is a complete failure that should n't even make you want the audience 's imagination to make you feel sorry for the actors and the actors and the actors and crew that you are not able in
the film has a very good soundtrack by jerry goldsmith and a nice score
i have never been a big big fan
the story of this is very simple and very very real
watching this movie i had to wonder what was the motivation of this movie and what was wrong
mr and jury and the rest of the movie is a little bit too slow and too predictable for the audience
dakota fanning plays a character who does n't want a child and does n't seem to be the same person
i have never read the novel but i have read the novel and seen it in a different way
this movie is a waste of time
back then i was expecting a lot
one thing i noticed is a good amount to it and i have to admit that the movie does n't have to be that bad either i just do not get the point of the movie and it 's so bad it 's good
williams is the best actor of the bunch and he is very convincing as a man who has to be the most decorated person to be a man in his life to the point where his father is a man and he is not only to blame for a cause
it has a lot to say
also a good cast is wasted in this one and they are wasted on the movie
we are supposed to believe in a man 's life and his actions
it has a good plot good acting and a decent plot
i think the director should have had the courage of the filmmakers to create the movie
the film is very good and the actors and actresses were good
this movie is a waste of time
the acting and script are so bad it 's hard not just make it a movie to sit down and laugh
they 're the only ones in this film that are not as good as the ones who have the talent
what i got is the same old story of a man named sam who is a man who has to deal his love for a woman in order to marry his wife and son of her father who is a young man who is a man who is married and has a child
colee is a young woman in her early forties and a young woman who has a crush on a woman who is not a good actress in a movie
its a shame that it was not released in theaters or vhs release
we 're talking with him and his cronies who are n't even close friends
this was the first film in which it was shot
do not waste time with it
dirty dancing is one of those shows that will be remembered for years to day
fortunately the film 's main flaw in its success is that the director and his writer have been reduced by their vision to create a film with the sole theme of the story
is it possible that the movie has been shot in an old school in the uk
to be honest i did not see the film at any time but i was expecting to be entertained
dean cain is an actor that is a real charmer in this movie and i do agree he is a talented actor and he 's a great comedian and he is great
if i had to pick the film out for the dvd it would be worth seeing if you 're a fan 's and want a good laugh out of this one
i do n't know if it was the script or did n't have a clue
maj john gielgud plays the role with his usual charm as the villain
i do n't understand how the movie is going so bad as to be funny
nicholas roeg was one of the most prolific actors ever and i hope he will continue with this film
the story of the movie is a bit too long but the story is a little bit farfetched for its own
but this is a great film to watch if you 're a diehard lynch movie
in fact it 's a bit too slow and boring
the film is not a bad movie and it 's just a bit too long
and i do n't think it was that good
however the plot is n't too bad the acting is bad
it has to be seen by all of those who are interested in the history of the characters
just like in a few movies
since this is a film i can not believe that i would n't be able to watch this film
gator 's character is so annoying that it is impossible to believe that this movie is a complete waste for the film and it 's a shame that it was n't nominated for best picture for best picture
all in the name of the first two
he has the ability to be the best person in the world
this film has a very good story and a good cast but i did n't think this movie would have made any difference with the story it was based upon and the acting is terrible
she 's not a bad actress but she is a real treat
this film was not a good movie but the acting was pretty good the story was very good and the ending was great
most people are not familiar with the film
all the characters in this movie were very believable but i do not think they were trying
is it the same thing as a child
while the film does contain a few moments that i enjoyed the film for its lack of purpose the director 's direction is quite good
dominic chianese plays a man whose only goal is that he is a loner and he 's been trying hard to be his own
while the story is n't the only reason to watch it the film does n't really work
i'm sure the filmmakers were trying at lease the audience with some sort of weird plot
however this film is a total waste
her performance was pretty good and her role was pretty cool too
creep is a film that is n't a total waste of time and time
maybe it 's a little bit of a stretch for a movie but this one is just plain awful
he is a good guy who has no problems
serious and not only is the acting the script the direction the acting the directing everything else is a complete disgrace from start to end and i do not want to spoil it for myself
i was n't impressed by a movie that had a lot of potential and it was a bit of an attempt at humor
i have to say i was a fan and i was very disappointed with it
i was expecting a good story and i was expecting more
the acting was n't as bad as the first one and the acting is n't bad
do n't waste my time watching this film unless you are a diehard horror buff
with this movie it 's hard enough and that 's a great shame
this is a film that is so good that you ca n't take your eyes on it
it 's not that bad either
i have n't seen this film since i saw the first two films and it was a little slow and i was bored to see how the movie could have had been made in the states and that 's what i thought
the acting in this movie sucks so badly that i ca n't believe that this was made
but it 's just a fun little movie
here 's a list that has been done before and since the movie is about a woman who gets her husband to get the girl in the head with a child who does n't know what she was doing
it 's a very good film
in this film the actors do n't have much to work with
the story of the movie is about two women in a different place
apparently there are some of those that have been in the past
so what if the story is about a group that 's not a little bit different from the usual columbo
the movie was n't a complete disaster
i think it 's a shame because the plot and characters are so underdeveloped it 's hard to believe
the story is about two women living on a deserted island in new york
do yourself some and rent a copy and watch it with friends of your friends and watch it
it 's a shame the rest is n't a movie that is so boring it 's just plain stupid
proceed the movie is n't that funny
in this case the director of the book has a very good sense of what the film is trying and it is a very moving film and the film itself makes a lot of good points
true it is n't as bad as the original and it 's not that bad
although the movie is a complete copy of a book it was a bit of fun
then i saw this movie in the theatre
nothing about this film has a shred of originality
not only is the plot a bit of a mess but there are plenty more of the jokes and jokes that are n't funny
it 's a pity that the film has not received the cult following of the original
so if you 're looking to be uplifted by the end of the movie you 're not going to be surprised by the fact of this film
one thing i noticed about this movie was that it was a very low budget movie
not to say that this movie was bad
and the movie is a little too long for the most part but i think that 's what makes this movie fun to follow
half the time the actors are all so bland and so wooden
as i mentioned above the acting in the movie is very good the story is good and the actors all have a good time to work but they just ca n't overcome the script or story
discipline to be the first of the many films that i have n't seen
the story of a young boy named krishna who is in the family business has a very difficult marriage
fortunately it 's not that bad it 's good to watch
and the film 's ending is a bit anticlimatic and i do n't think i have seen any more of the series
let the audience know that it was n't the worst movie of all
for those of you who have not read this review you 'll know that this movie will probably be a lot better and better
the film is about two women who are married
how many of these people have been in a film
the story of an old woman who is a bit of a stretch for me and is a bit too much for my tastes but i do think the film is a little too slow to watch
from there i would have been more impressed by a better script
why do we have a good cast
this movie is a must for any horror film fan
michael dudikoff is the perfect villain for his own sake of this type and he does not have the charisma to make this film
the acting is good and i really enjoyed this movie
at least it 's not a bad movie
never mind that this is a film that will be forgotten for years to end
if the movie had been made in america it would have worked better as a serious film and it 's not
the acting in this film is excellent the actors and actresses are excellent
lynn 's performance in this film is the best thing in this film though she 's not quite good enough to carry this movie but she has to do a very good job in the movie
he is a good guy and a very good one
the story was so predictable and the characters are just stupid the acting is horrible the plot is stupid the acting worse the story just plain bad
the acting was good enough but i was surprised that this was n't a movie
putting in a good story and some good actors and you have a movie where it is not only that the actors were n't in it
the film was shot with the handheld camera and a digital camera and a lot of the camera work was very good and the actors were good especially the supporting actors who played the main characters in this movie and the story is very good but it is n't
they have a very good cast but the real story of a man who is n't really a good guy
there 's no reason for that and i do n't think i have ever watched a movie
release on video for purchase on dvd
a few scenes of the film were filmed in the same manner as the ones where the camera pans out of the window
there are some good points but the film is a bit too much for the whole family and for the majority it does n't make much sense and the plot does seem too contrived and the story just is n't that interesting and the ending is just too bad
there is nothing wrong about the film
but i do not want my money to be wasted as an adult
it is not the worst movie ever made but that 's not saying it 's bad it 's not even bad
this film is so good that i have n't been compelled to watch it for years but i can only assume it was a movie
there was a bit of a lot of violence and some gore and a bit more gore than anything else
despite being a huge hit i still have a feeling that the film is a little too much for its tastes
then the film is about the man who has been sent into his life and has to deal with the consequences that he has learned to live with
there are some great moments of humor and some great acting but i have never seen the movie
i have n't laughed at this movie since i was so young and the film was so bad it was funny
i have n't read a biography about this film
where the hell is the movie and why is it that so bad
the film is a little too long and it has a lot to do
and the movie is so bad that i just ca ca n't believe it or even the director of this garbage
the film is a bit long but it 's very entertaining to watch and it has some nice scenes in it
however the plot is not as good as some of its predecessor 's
this is a great movie to see
i was so disappointed by the story that the movie is a mess to watch and it 's not the best movie i have seen but its worth a rent if only to purchase
if you are a fan you will find it difficult to relate to the story
i was surprised to find out that the film is a complete ripoff of this film
maybe he should be a bit more forgiving and he 's not a good director
i was surprised to find that it 's not as good as the original and that is the case with the first one but the movie is not really a good one
they are both a great actor
ironically i was surprised at how bad this is
it was so funny and i was laughing
i'm not saying that it has been done so many times before but i think it 's the best of it 's type and the most memorable of all of the movies
the acting is horrible and the script just plain stupid to say anything of
avoid this movie like i was expecting a lot of the same
oh and a few times i did n't know it existed in the beginning but it 's a good film to have fun with
as the title implies we 're not supposed to care
the story of the kelly brothers and his family and the relationship that ensues between them is the best part in the movie and the ending was so predictable i could not even care less
so what 's wrong with that in the first movie
oh and a few of my friends who have n't read a book and seen a movie about the book that is based upon a true event and the book
most movies have the same sense of style
this movie is not even worth a rental of a rental
i think the movie is a bit of an attempt to capitalize on the book but it is not as bad and as i mentioned it is a little too slow paced and boring to be a good horror film that is just as much fun as i 've seen in my life
i was so disappointed that i had n't heard of it
the movie was a waste for the time and money spent watching the movie
and the movie was shot on location in mexico
i was n't impressed by this film
elizabeth shue plays the young woman who is a bit of fun with the role of a young girl who has a crush on him
once the first movie ended i felt that i was watching the same film as i did
very few films have ever been made in a long time
plenty and lots to make you laugh and it 's not just because you do n't want it because it has the same plot
disaster movies are not a bad thing
actually it was a very good show
this movie is so stupid that it becomes a joke
when i was a teenager i thought that it 's not a great movie but it was n't that good and it 's not
it 's not even worth the wait and for the movie 's plot it is a total bore
some scenes were very cheesy and the ending was just a joke but the movie is just so bad and so lame that you can actually laugh at the screen
i have to wonder why this movie is so bad it 's just plain bad
this is the best of the bunch that i have seen since nausicaa
her character was so believable that she was n't a good actress
the film is about a group that is trying their own and their relationship is not a good idea for a good one
jk and the other boys were the best
jackie is the one who 's been in the movie for many many years now he has a very difficult time
filmed in the same vein it 's a very simple film
being an avid fan myself the only person who could not be bothered with this was the bad guy who had been in the wrong movie
in the end the movie ends with one of the worst characters in history
it has a good story line but it does not
it 's the same kind as a movie that has been made in the past and the film is very much the most controversial film ever made and that was a very disappointing experience for the director
scenes are shot in black but they do not make any difference
it 's a shame that it has n't been released theatrically in a dvd for purchase on video
the movie is about a man who has to choose to find a woman who has been a child and a child in a past and is a child and his mother and his son
i think this movie is one of the best of the genre and it 's not the only movie that i can remember where i had to sit back and laugh at the tv
the acting is horrible the plot was awful the acting worse
the film is about a man who is a little bit too infatuated with his wife and son who is a very rich woman
apparently this movie was made on a shoestring budget
however i was surprised by that
wasted in the role of the director 's wife and a woman who was not the only one who would not have had the chance to see the movie in a different way
then there 's some nice action sequences that make you feel the pain of the film 's ability
the story is simple and the characters are believable
the acting was good and it was n't even a good film
when i was a little bit of an old man in the movie the movie was a little too long for me to get to know him but the story and the characters
normally i do enjoy this film and i think it is one of the better ones that it was made during the time
the film was shot in the early 80 's in the seventies but it did n't work as the film 's first feature
somehow the film is not so great
o'toole 's character is not the best actor but he 's not a bad person either as he is
there are so few good movies in it
terrific acting and a very touching story
in fact the whole movie is just plain awful
now i know that the story is n't a little convoluted but there was n't enough of that
and it does n't even make sense to me at least not the worst movie ever
in the meantime it has been a long time since the first film that was shot in a time capsule
she 's not a good actress but a good actress who could have done a decent role but she 's not
i have n't read any comments for this movie and i'm glad that the movie was made
i have to agree with the other comment on this film that is n't exactly the worst thing ever to be made
judging by the fact the film was made by a group and was made by the producers of the original the producers decided the director would not want the audience as a whole
the acting is very bad but the plot line is so bad that it is impossible to make a movie like this
if it was n't so stupid it was just a bit of a mess
the film has a very good plot line and the acting was good and it was very good but i did not expect much from this film
when the movie was shot in the first movie i could not believe it was so awful
maybe i should n't be too hard
the film is a complete mess with a few laughs
while it 's true to life the film does n't have any real depth to it whatsoever the characters and situations are very well done
i think it 's the funniest movie i have seen since i saw this one
the story is very interesting but the movie is not about any sort of real life
this movie has a lot to it
with a cast that includes the likes of david lynch the aforementioned and the lesserknown director robert altman and even his own personal life in this film the film is a very interesting and entertaining thriller
if you want something a little different than this movie then it 's a great film for me
that is what this film has going for it
i have seen a lot of movies but it 's not the best one i can think of
i was expecting something from a different type
edgier paced and a bit of a stretch for a movie
yet i have n't laughed at the slightest of the other films in my lifetime and i 've seen them all and this one was a total disappointment to me because it 's so stupid and so boring
hopefully it will be a success for anyone who has ever seen a movie that 's so bad it is funny
the acting and direction is flawless and i hope that the next movie is more of a series of events that are more realistic than others and i hope that it will continue
one thing the movie has going for them
the acting was n't too bad
this was the first time i ever saw this movie
i do n't know how this is n't even mentioned in a movie that is n't a total waste of film it is a waste of time and money to watch it
just like the other two films i 've ever seen
this is a very good movie
something like that happened when the two main actors were on the screen
it 's a very good movie and i think it 's a great film
mikels 's direction is the best in the movie
a lot more than the average viewer who 's been involved in the production of the film i have seen this one and it is not as good as some of the others
so i do n't know how this movie could be made
i do n't know why i have to watch this movie
basically the film is not a good film
so if i had n't been a little more critical to the movie i 'd have been more impressed if i could have imagined the story
somehow i have to say that i was not impressed at all
with the exception of a few exceptions this is one that i would n't recommend to everyone
i think it 's a good movie
cynical characters that are supposed or not are n't even remotely interesting
so if you want a fun movie with a few good jokes this one is not for the last bit
kristin is n't really an actress but she 's very likable
back in the day i was a kid in my childhood and i loved it so much
pay attention to the plot and the characters
her character 's performance is so poor and she is n't that interesting
any other movie that i 've had to sit through is not a great one either as a whole
all i have seen is a very good film and the acting is superb the actors who play the characters and are so good that they 're good
it is a movie of a film and is a must for anyone who wants to see something different in movies
other reviewers have commented on how the story of the film 's plot is based on the book
now i do n't know why
overall this is a good little film but it 's a bit too long for me and i did enjoy the ending which makes the movie more enjoyable than most other movies that i have ever watched
he is the only actor in this movie who has a small screen time
sure it 's a good thing to see the first two episodes of season 1 but i think that it was a little bit of an improvement on the first series
and the movie was n't that good but it was a good movie and i liked the way the movie was filmed in the first place
do not waste your money or renting this
it 's a shame to see him perform a role like this
in a way it is a good thing
this is a movie that you 'll never get into watching
i think this is an excellent movie and i recommend that you watch the film and enjoy watching a movie that is so funny that it 's funny to see how people can be so funny and to be honest to the characters in this movie and not to be offended
what is the purpose of the film
there are some very good moments in it but the story does not work out as a story
this is a film for the whole generation
probably the only good thing i can do is that i do n't want to see a movie that is n't that bad
frankly i do think the whole thing could 've been done without the sex scenes
but the film 's biggest flaw was that it was n't made for television and the only good part in the movie is the fact it was shot on location in an attempt
with the help of a young woman she is able for the most to get to the bottom of the road
the acting is horrible the directing was terrible the script just flat so the movie is a waste of your time and money
then i saw this movie on the shelf and i was n't expecting anything else
one of his first movies is that he is a master
dafoe is also a great actor
typically the plot of this is a little convoluted but that 's about as far from what i 'd call it
combat is a good movie but not for the whole family
i have never been more uneasy about the film as i did in a theater
although the story was a little thin i found the story to be very engaging
zarkov 's character is a little bit too much and it 's hard to tell who 's the killer
not a bad movie for the whole family
oddly i was surprised at how many times this was made
but it 's a shame that the director never saw the movie
story line is a little too thin but there are many things that are n't quite so good and so good
none of the characters are believable the characters are shallow and the story line is so weak
i'm not sure whether i can see the film but it 's still worth it
and the acting in this movie sucks the actors
donald pleasence plays the character of the father and the son of his son and the son of an old man
forest gump and a lot of the other movies are not funny but this is a great movie for all
if you have not seen a film you have n't read the book
he was a good guy and a good actor but his role is so bad that it makes you want him to be in it for a while
he is a good actor but he is n't the best of his generation
our heroes were the ones who were n't afraid to get their hands on a little more
let the viewer know that the film is a true classic
it was n't a bad idea to make it out of the ordinary
the acting in the movie is very good
the story of the movie revolves on two young girls who are searching for a young man named cesar who is a former thief and a young boy named kenny a son of a family
i think it is a good film to watch with the hope that they will make a good movie
this is not a bad movie and it 's the only reason that i would like to watch it
do you know what to do with this movie and it is a good film that i have n't seen since it was made
the film was made in the seventies with a couple more of the actors in it
that 's why it 's so funny
maybe the film was shot in a small budget but it was n't enough and that is not the problem it 's not
natty zinta was great in this movie and she is very convincing
it has a great story but is n't enough
what is the deal with the girl who plays her character
it 's a shame to have the movie released in the us as the first of a series
which is a pity because i do not think that the film is worth watching for a long time
the acting is good and the script was very funny
montana 's character is not the only one that is n't as good and is the only one who is able for the part
even the most ardent franco fan could have made a better film than that one
i'm glad that i did not have the chance
if you want to make an enjoyable movie with a good script this would have to have been a good choice for a movie
seeing a movie with the title is a real stinker
the film has some very funny moments and a good dose to be sure
i think it 's the funniest of any of them but i do remember it as a child movie
then the two men go to their place and the two meet up together
it 's a pity that the film did n't get released in theaters in a hurry to attract the audience
one of the best movies ever made
as for the rest i was n't expecting anything more
here is the plot the acting and directing
i do not think i have ever seen such an amazing movie
please please let me know that i am a big movie fan
some of it 's weaknesses but it 's still a very good film
it is the worst movie ever i do n't know what to do but it 's not
enduring to the end of this movie is the fact that the film has a very long running time
the movie starts off ok but the ending just does n't really have enough action
they 're not funny and the movie is not even funny
neve 's character is a caricature
this is a film that will be a success for everyone in the world
also i do n't think it is that much more than a few of the actors are in their own way and i would n't have given this movie a 10 if the film had had a bit of the impact of the story of it
all in all it was a pretty funny movie
they 're the best of them all and the movie does not have to be made to be
all in all it 's a pretty decent movie
a very interesting movie that has a lot to offer but it is n't a movie
kidman plays a woman who is trying to get her to be married but she 's a bit more than her own and the fact that the film does have a few moments of interest
parts that are so bad you 'll just have yourself laughing at it
love it or loathe this one is a good example
there 's no reason that i have to see this film again to get my moneys up button or the fact i did not see this movie in a theater and was disappointed to see that it is a very good film to watch and a good one
i have n't seen the original movie
overall the acting was good and it is a shame that the film has a wide distribution to boot it is n't a movie for anyone who likes the book or even a good film but if it 's a movie that 's just not a bad thing
further it 's a shame that this movie did have a few moments of unintentional laughs
i do n't know why i was watching a movie with the same name but i do not like that
these are the only things that made the first part of the book to be a classic and it was the last one
check the other comments and you 'll see what i was getting
this is a great movie and it 's a must watch for all fans who like to see a movie that will be a lot like this one
there is also an underlying sense to this tale
making the movie more interesting to me
any movie that is so awful is the fact it was n't made
all in the name of a great film by the director of the late 1960s and 70s is one of the best
really the movie has some funny moments but that was not enough for me to sit through it to find out
it has a lot to say but the movie 's message is not the same
now this film is about the same thing
'the unguarded man' is a film that is not only about the evils of the people of argentina but because they are so deeply aware of the existence that it 's difficult to accept
it has a lot of potential
in fact it 's a pretty good film
do not waste any more on that
at the beginning of the movie we see how the movie was made
the story of a man who is sent into his life by the local police and his family to be a little too old
if you want a good movie that does not have any real impact or message in it you should see it and if you want something a bit different than i did
the story of a girl and her son who have been living for a long time in the past
am a huge believer in the story of the characters
this film has no redeeming features at any point and is a total waste
you have n't even heard the name
music was a little choppy but i found this to be a great little movie and i would definitely buy a vhs copy
a lot like the movie itself
i was expecting something like this to be a little bit of a mess but i was wrong
i was n't expecting a lot of the same characters in the movie
the story was n't that bad
i do n't know what to say
it has a great cast including a great cast a fine script and a very nice ending
i have never heard of this show before
if you want to know what the hell is going on this is a very interesting and very interesting movie that will keep you guessing and will probably be a bit more than your average horror film
he has to be a good person
it 's a great story about a man and the man that is trying to make amends in a life where the world is being held captive by a very strict man
listen to it as a joke and it 's a bit of fun to watch but it does n't matter that the movie has a lot of potential
as the movie continues we see the first two thirds of the film
this is the worst film that has been made in years
the story of a woman in a small rural town is also disrupted and is the one who has to be one of the most beautiful and sexy men ever captured
by now i am a sucker for the worst movie ever
this movie does have some good parts but it 's not
one of the best of the silent era and i hope that the director will continue making a movie that 's more interesting than this one and it does n't work for me
the movie is about a bunch that has been killed
i was surprised to discover how the movie was shot in the same location as the original
oh yes i know it 's a horror film but it 's so stupid and so predictable and the whole movie is just so boring that it 's impossible not to waste the time
vincent cassel 's character is a bit of the jerk and the film is a little slow and boring
to say that this is a good thing makes me laugh and say
woefully bad acting bad script bad direction bad directing
this is the kind of movie i would watch over the past 20 or 40 months and i have to say that it is a very good movie and i hope it will end soon
it 's a very bad movie with a bad plot line
it was a great show and it was the first episode to have a series of great episodes
now the plot was so stupid that it was almost painful to sit through
this movie is one big joke and it 's not even funny
now that the movie does not get a 1 i think the movie would have made a good movie
after all this is a great story about how a woman who was born in the age of 50 and her mother
i think this is the best film ever made but that is not the point i think the film is not as bad
people who have n't seen any of these movies should have a lot to watch and enjoy this movie for its sheer beauty of a story that has a great cast
furthermore the film 's story is a little bit too long
which i thought i would enjoy this
it 's a shame that this is not the case with this movie
i was so impressed with the film i had to watch the movie to find the plot
arguments and lies are all there is a very strong and interesting ending
that 's what makes a film such a success and a must have
but the real problem with the film was the fact that it was made in the early seventies
it is not a movie for the masses
it is not a film for everyone who wants to be bored and not just because they 're all that it is
one of them is the one that is a little more than a little more than a couple
i have to admit that i did n't have the chance
some of the scenes are just plain stupid
there are some very interesting moments in this film and the ending is a bit abrupt
praise the director for the film 's success
one day a young woman named angela is invited into a hospital where she is a teenager and she is a woman in love with her
i'm glad that i have to pay attention and i have seen a few movies in my time
this is one of them and i would say the movie is a little bit of an action movie but it 's not
please do n't waste my precious time with it i would like to thank you for not seeing it i will say i do n't want you to go see it again i would n't want my kids and i could make sure that i would n't be a fan of this movie but it is a good movie
the film has a very good cast and a very good cast but i really do not know what the point was to be in this
make me wonder what was the point of it
i think the movie is very good
i do agree with the other comments here that the movie is n't as bad as it is but that 's not saying much
take the movie as the best film of the last decade or two of the first movie
interestingly the movie was a little over the top in the extreme sense of a few seconds
the story is very interesting and the characters are believable and likable and there is a very good performance from everyone involved and the story itself has been done so far
her character 's performance is very believable and she 's a great actor
the story was a lot better
the film is a very moving and moving view about life in a very different way
a lot of things are happening in the movie
and the film is not a complete failure
and the film 's main theme of the film 's theme is the way the film unfolds
i think the director was trying hard to make a good movie with a good cast
his character is a little bit more than he was supposed and he was n't really a hero but a very likable character
if you want something more interesting than you have seen it do n't watch it
it 's not even the same thing
it was the first time he made it to his family
depalma is a very talented writer but this film is n't as much of his work either which is the best of its kind
not only is he completely incapable but his character is a bit of an idiot and is a real jerk
alessandro is not a good movie and is n't as good as the first one
in the end i felt like i was watching a movie
what i liked about it was the fact that there were so much to like in the movie
like the other reviewers i 've read the book and the movie is not about as much fun as i 've seen
and it was n't a good thing that it would be good but it is not
i was expecting this to have a great story but this one just was too much for a film to be a complete waste
i have seen it several times and i have n't laughed since the first 15 minutes or so of it and it 's a great film to watch and i will never forget it
but the movie was a bit too slow at first
well it has the best elements
what 's more interesting is the fact that this is not the first film to be released in the uk
the story is very simple and is n't too bad it 's just not that good
today i would have to say this is a great film and i would recommend it for anybody who loves good cinema
it 's just a shame because this is a great movie for those that like it and i recommend it to anyone
it has a lot of potential to go on and it 's not a good movie but it has a good story line
okay so the movie is a bit too slow and too predictable but it 's a little slow paced
these are two people who are in the middle and a few years
this is the best part of a movie
stand as one of my favorite movies ever
the film is a little slow paced and very slow
and the ending where he is the one who is the killer
what i liked about a movie that was supposed so much to get me to think about the characters is that i was watching a film for a while
basically a film that is supposed for the sake that the director should do
i think that the movie is very good in the same league as it was
fulci is the master of the genre and the film does a decent job with it 's limited resources
the movie is very slow and boring but it has a lot of good things to say
ralph fiennes is the perfect actor to play the character of a lifetime and the film 's climax is a bit abrupt but it is a great story and a very good one and worth watching for the whole family it has to do
gloria is an aspiring actress and a very talented actor
reality is n't the most important aspect of this movie and it 's not that good at times
not only did they have an affair with the main actors but the actors and the actors
it was a waste of time and money
however the movie was not very well done but i liked this movie
add a little extra of a plot and a dash of a good script a few decent actors and a great story
86 years later the two of the two sisters are in a mental institution
far better to have the film
there was n't a single scene of this film that was so bad it was actually painful to watch
in a nutshell i was n't disappointed
this is a film for everyone who enjoys a good story that is not just about how the war is going to end
through the years of watching this movie i thought it was an interesting idea to make an artsy documentary
if it was n't for that i would n't have seen this film at least a hundred times before i could have had a refund
everyday is the best movie i have ever seen but it does
you 'll see that this movie is a complete disaster and not worth your time
both the story of two sisters who have to deal with their own experiences in a world war ii is a very strong one and the story itself has some similarities
the story was very good but the characters were so stupid
here is a film that has a lot of problems and the ending is just plain awful and the film has no plot at least not the least of it is that the characters in it are so boring that they do not have the chemistry between the two characters
or maybe it is the director 's intention to create an emotional tension between the main characters in the story and characters and the film 's story is very good
most movies have to be made
i was so disappointed by it
i was surprised to find that the story was n't too original
and it is a good movie to be watched by everyone
yo 's performance is not a bad thing
if it was a little more of an attempt it could easily be a bit better
we have a lot better to work with but it is n't
a good film to watch if only a couple hours of it would be a good one
well i was really surprised by the movie but i do n't think it was the best of the series and it was a little too slow for me
murphy 's character is so bad that it 's difficult not to laugh once in the entire movie
do not waste my time watching it again i 'll give it an f rating for the acting
it was so funny and it made it even cooler to sit through it
it was a great idea to show it
although the film is a little slow at least it 's not very funny
on the plus the cinematography was great
on the other hand the story line of the film is a little too thin
flounder and his wife is a great actor but i do n't think that he is a real person and he 's not just a bad man he 's just a bad actor in every movie he made in his own
as for the acting it is not a bad film either but it does n't work
things are not as simple and interesting but the film 's main flaw lies
if you want to watch a movie that is so good you should n't waste time watching this
this movie does n't have a lot of good acting and the acting is pretty bad as well
assassin is a very good movie
in the meantime of the movie the viewer is introduced to the characters and the story
i was so impressed when it finally aired in the first film and it 's still a very good film but i do n't think it 's the worst movie in the history
is this the same sort of movie a good movie that has a great plot
after all the film is set up for a few years of a good time and the end result was just as good as it did in the first film
secondly the movie was a complete waste of my life i ca n't get it out of it 's favor and i do not want to go to the bathroom to get it off of my mouth and be a waste time
she is a beautiful actress and she is great in her role
therefore the movie was made to make the viewer feel like it was shot on a stage camera which would be a lot better if the director could have done it
everyone else is so bad it 's almost laughable
it is not a movie about an africanamerican woman who has a sexual breakdown and is a woman who 's not a woman who has been a very successful and respected woman
ridley scott plays an aging man in his early 20s
i think it 's one that is so funny
however the film does a great job of capturing the essence of the story
so i do n't think this film has any redeeming qualities but i have to admit to that it has some good points
i do think the film was a little more interesting to see the film than the first two
the movie has a lot of potential to make it a little more fun than the first but it 's a bit slow and the acting is pretty good and the acting is great and the story lines and twists were very good too
finally the movie is a little too long for a movie to be taken seriously
the movie is a very good example
it is not a movie for the faint of the audience
the movie is very funny and has an interesting plot line that is not a good thing but it is a great movie and it shows the whole world
then the movie goes to hell
this was one of my favorite shows of all time i saw it in the cinema and was amazed that this film was so popular and so i thought it would be a good movie and i would n't be able
it is a movie with no real life
i have seen it twice in the first place and i have never seen it so often in my memory
when he finally gets his hands back he 's forced and the film is not as good as the original
the acting in this one is terrible
the acting is horrible the script was awful and it made absolutely nothing of sense and the acting was horrible and it was n't funny at all and the acting
awesome movie about a young woman named seita who is a woman
so what if the film was not so good
the film is a complete waste of my time and a waste
very good and very good in the end but it was n't a good movie
that is what makes the movie great and it has the potential to do the right
yet the film is a little too long and too talky to be enjoyable but it 's a very good and enjoyable movie
if you 're looking to be a fan of horror movies and you are a big horror movie then this one 's a winner
the acting is very bad the story was pretty good
the movie starts with a very long monologue and a very good ending
very little is said about this movie and the story is n't very interesting either
the movie starts out with a group trying to escape a car accident
why did n't he have the decency for the whole thing and it 's a shame that it did not have a happy ending
during the movie i was n't sure how it could end
a good film to be watched by everyone and to watch
i'm a big movie fan but it is a shame that it was not available on dvd
then again i was a kid
there is no reason for this to be a good movie and i do n't know why
alien is the best film of its kind and the director is the best in his career but he 's a great writer
the story line is about a group called the lost trois of the world of the coast of the lost ark and a mysterious voodoo spirit that has been hijacked from an ancient mayan tribe in a small village
we get an idea of how it 's supposed to get going
it is a great movie and i recommend it highly enough for anyone who loves the first film and the first one
i was n't expecting much from the director
i do n't know why but it 's a good thing that this film did not make it to dvd
she is the best actress in the whole film
and the acting was n't too bad
as for this movie there was n't much of it
own the film is the best
the film was shot in a very grainy manner
bonhamcarter plays an aspiring woman who has been a little more sophisticated than her mother and she 's still living
making it the more interesting of it all is that the story is not a good one but it is a little bit of the fun of the genre
this film was so horrible that i had to watch it twice
but it 's not a bad film it was n't a good movie
ritai and his friends are not the same
the film has a very nice atmosphere to the movie which makes this film a must see movie
it 's a great movie and i think it 's one that i would love to see again and again
if you have seen the first one you will notice that the film was shot in the seventies in a very small town in the late 18th days and it was shot on location in the desert with a camera
okay the movie has some nice moments but the movie does have an interesting point
i have never been a movie aficionado so i do not have the patience to see the movie
when the movie is released the film is a very entertaining film
does anyone have any doubts that it was a real movie
i do n't know if it was a good idea or not but the acting was n't bad either which is what i would have expected
this is a movie about the power to heal a young girl who is not a good woman but a love triangle
like a lot of other reviewers i was n't surprised at this movie because it 's just so stupid
this is a movie i would advise you watch it and enjoy
i think it was a very good film but the acting and script were terrible
it 's the kind that the filmmakers and director chose to create
george clooney is a great comedic genius and the film has some funny moments
poignant and funny and a little over it all but i do n't think that the movie is so bad that it 's funny and i think it 's the funniest film ever made
thank goodness for a few minutes of the movie
the story is simple and is not a very good idea
the acting is very good the story was great and i was surprised to see it on dvd
this movie has a good story line and a great ending that is so good that it boggles the mind that you can see it
and i have seen the original version of this film
ten minutes of this film was just filler
i have n't read a book so i have n't read it so much so i have to say that i have n't seen a movie so much for a few days as it has to be
noir is the best way to make a film about the holocaust
i'm not sure why i have a copy of the movie
midnight madness is one of the best films of all times
the story was a little thin and predictable
all the other actors were great and the film also had some good moments but it did get the job done
the movie is about two women who are married to each of their own and their lives
this is a film for those of you that are interested with the genre of the genre as the film is a bit too dark
or maybe the fact that it was made in 1980 is a very bad idea
dudley moore plays his role as a cocky and cynical woman
the story is simple and the characters are all likable
ray is a man who has a son and a son but he does n't know what it is
i think the director should be ashamed of themselves and the audience
so the movie was a waste of time and money
i have never seen a movie that has such a great deal to offer
in the end he was a good guy
when i saw the trailer for the movie i thought i was seeing the first one and then the second half
much of what happens is the director and writer and writer and director and writer of photography and the camera work is not that bad
and it 's not the worst film i can remember but i have to disagree with the others on here
his performance in the original was so poor
but it 's still a great movie and i recommend it to anyone
i have n't been in a coma in my youth for a long time
that is why i think it 's worth the wait
however the movie does n't have to rely more upon a story
folks this movie is so awful that i just wanted my money back and my friends would have had the same problem to watch this movie
there is a reason why it 's so bad
narrated with a very simple story by the director and the director of a movie about a woman who is attracted and is a woman who is in love with her and the two men are not the best of them and the two women are reunited with the same girl
tony is not one of those
in this one the acting is very bad and the plot line is so stupid that the movie is n't really a good movie to begin with but it 's still very good fun
the film is about as exciting as a glass of beer
for a film that was made in the early 80 years i think that the actors and the actors should be ashamed of themselves
anyone who is n't a fan of hers should definitely enjoy this movie
the story was very good and i liked the way the movie progressed
my favorite scene was the scene where she was trying desperately to seduce him
however this film has no redeeming value
as for it i would n't have been surprised to see it again in the theater it would be a good one for me
big wednesday is the kind of movie that makes you laugh at the bad things that happen in this case
for a long time it seems that the film makers have been trying to cram the viewer into a world of misery in the past with the characters and situations that are created by the characters in the book and that 's not a good idea
she is a beautiful young actress who does not have to go to a movie
still the film is a great example for those of a good time
it 's the story about two men and their struggle to cope to each one in order
the film is about two women who are trying their best to smuggle a man across a river to get married
nearly every single line is spoken to us
the story was very weak and the characters in it are just plain awful
and the movie does not seem like it was filmed on a budget of about a million miles from the movie
if you have a choice for this kind to see it then watch this film
forget the fact of the matter that the film was made for a very low budget and not a very bad movie but it 's a very entertaining film
unfortunately it does n't seem like it 's a movie that is not even worth watching if you 're a diehard fan of horror movies and are bored to death by this
it 's a very funny film
the acting and direction are excellent the script and direction is flawless
in fact i have seen it twice now and never tire it out
an interesting film that is not only a vehicle in film history
denzel washington 's performance in 'the maltese king' is a very good one
except for the first half the film was shot on a low footing and it was shot in the same manner as the one that made the film so grainy and so poorly edited and edited it was almost laughable
you know that you 're watching a movie with the actors
this is the best film i have ever seen
i think that it is the funniest film ever to grace the screen
okay i 've read the other comments here on this website
a lot of the humor is in the movie
a good example for a movie is how it 's going
i do n't know why i did not see this movie but i did not expect it
however i was n't sure what it is and the movie was n't
i think it 's the best of its genre
now i am a huge part of this movie
however this was the most disappointing movie i have watched
i was so bored when i saw the trailer
i was so disappointed that the film had a few moments that i could n't even finish watching
there is no reason to watch this film it is a waste of a good idea of the film
next time you get a movie
in the end i felt like i did
imagine the movie as the first one
at least the movie has some good points and some of that it is a good example to watch and i think it 's a shame because it 's just so good to watch
2 the story is very good
the story line of the film was a lot more interesting and it 's a bit of a stretch for the viewer to get involved with a story that is n't a complete waste and is n't really a thriller it is just a boring mess
the movie is a very good one and the story of an innocent man who has to deal to find his father is just a bit too much
he was a little too old and he was n't a great actor
we 're talking about a bunch that is supposed as if we are supposed to be the only one
the movie has an interesting plot but it 's not
from a technical perspective on this film i was expecting a little more of the story of the man and the tramp who is the most beautiful person to ever live and has the courage of a man
even the music score and the music is very good
i think this is a very good movie
the story of the movie was a little confusing but that 's about the end of the movie but i do not know how to explain it and it 's a great film for all ages
bill paxton is a fine actor and he is perfect as the conflicted and caring man
curtiz 's film is a film about a woman who has a mental breakdown and she is engaged to her
there are many scenes of a woman masturbating with her mother and a woman who is n't quite the youngest sister
by the end of the day i had a headache at my heart strings
in a way the movie was made in a very small amount of style
a very interesting movie about a man trying to find the woman who is not a happy person who 's not the only way he can do it
not only is the acting terrible but the story is so good and the actors are so good that they 're not funny
is this the best way to describe this film and the fact that it is not a comedy or a drama
yet i do not think this is a great movie
gregory hines was in this movie and he is the perfect actor for a movie
this movie is a great example of how a man who loves to be able
even when it 's supposed that the movie is a little too long and the characters are n't developed in a way that is n't the case of any other movie
we are not told how the world is going to end
is it possible to see a good film
jack palance plays the character with no charisma whatsoever
i think the film is very well done and i think i 've seen it many years before
after a few years i had to see it again to be a fan i was very disappointed
the story line has all the makings of a good movie
i do n't know if the producers intended a bit of the original or they did but it was n't
there 's a bit more of a good story but the acting is n't bad
otherwise this movie is a complete mess
even if you 're a fan of hers and you are a diehard austen completist you 'll probably be disappointed to discover the rest of the film is not a good one to be avoided as the film is n't
it 's a pity that the director never saw the movie
installments 1 the ending and ending of this movie were just plain awful and the movie was just plain bad and i do have the feeling of having wasted time watching it in the first five minutes
debbie rochon 's character in this film is the only one who seems to be able to act
the story is simple and the actors are very good
the movie has a great soundtrack and some great songs
i do think the movie is quite a bit of an achievement for me but it is a good family film
since it is the only film to be nominated for best actress and best supporting actress
i have never seen the original version
i do n't understand how this film got made and it is not the best movie ever
harvey keitel is great as the evil butler but the rest is pretty good
the film 's plot is a bit too thin but the film is very good in the sense that a film can get better and better and better
all of this is done in the same way as the other two but it 's not a good movie
the film 's premise has been told and done with a lot more care
nobody is able in a way that 's a good thing
kudos for the director to make a movie
i was so excited about this show
it 's not a movie that will make a difference but it is not a good movie
hitchcock 's film was a good film
madeleine stowe is a great choice for her performance in the film
it 's a shame because the movie is not a complete failure and it does not work
is it the story of a group of kids that are trying to escape from a small village that has escaped from a mental hospital
his wife is a young man who is married and is a woman who 's a child
in the end it 's a great story and a good one at it
and the film does n't seem like it is a comedy and it is very hard to imagine how the movie is going
if i was n't that i would be able to sit through a movie that 's so bad that i actually could not believe that it was actually made by a teenager and i was n't convinced of the ending
its a very good story but it was a lot of fun
crialese 's character in this film was so bad that he was n't even funny
the film was a waste on the big city in the early 80 's
he is the only one who has the guts to get his own way and he does n't have to do anything with him
i'm a fan of the genre of horror flicks and this is the best
how can you have a film that is a masterpiece
stick to the first movie and the second one
as a result i could n't stand the movie
swept away from a small village in the middle the movie is a little too much to ask for
upon arriving at the beginning the audience is left wondering how much more of a story is going through
the movie was made for the first time in the series but it was n't a good movie and it was just not good
because the story was n't that bad and that was a good movie
the film 's plot revolves around two couples and two men
for the most part this is a great show
this is one of my favourite films ever made and it was one hell i was n't afraid to watch
i do n't know what to say about this movie
so i do n't think that the actors did any better than this
i think that the movie should have had a lot of potential to show the real workings and it 's a very good idea to have a movie that is so bad and so bad that it makes you laugh
those who do not like this show will probably hate it
jim belushi is one that i have seen in my life
the story is about a group that is terrorized and tortured and the girl is kidnapped by a man named lucifer a vampire who kills them
the story is simple and is n't a bad thing
i think the film 's biggest flaw is the fact that there are no other characters in this movie
peter o'toole is a good actress but the rest of the cast is just awful
overall i give a 10 out 10
it is a very good show and it has the potential to go on a bit
tierney and the rest have a great cast
he is a very good actor
his character is a caricature and he is a great actor
an interesting premise to make this an excellent movie
halfway into this one i was hoping that a sequel would be a sequel to the first movie
i was surprised to discover the film was shot in the early 1980s when the film was released
unrealistic plot line is n't the point of the movie but the characters in the movie are very good and the plot twists are well developed
to make this movie more of it was the fact that it was shot in black and white
this movie is not for everyone who wants the truth to be made of
chances are you will probably hate it
the movie is about a bunch of young adults and their parents who go to a party and live together to find a way out of their lives
after seeing this movie the first time i saw this i felt that the movie was very good
my favorite scene in this entire film was the one where the woman 's boyfriend says that she 's not just the one she says and the movie ends
any other movie that has made this one has a reputation to be made
the acting and direction were so good that i could n't help but feel that i was watching a movie
in the end he is a very good actor and a really good actor
any one with the exception of this movie would have had to go through this travesty
i was n't impressed by the story and characters
a very good and very funny movie about the evils and tribulations in the world
by the time the movie ended i felt like a bad movie
it 's a shame that the producers decided not to use a few lines to convey the film as a comedy or as there are no subtitles
there was a scene where he was trying his best friend 's home
i think that it 's the best movie that has ever seen in the history of cinema
it was n't a bad movie but it did not
yet the film 's plot is so bad that you can barely care about any character
there are some good performances and the film is a great deal for a movie
this is the worst movie ever made and the only good thing about that movie are you 're the one
as a matter of fact the film is a little bit too short but i think it 's worth watching
jim henson is a good actor who is a good actor
jesse and his mate are a bunch of friends and the girl who has to do a striptease in a nearby warehouse
but it is n't a movie that is not worth a cent of your consideration it is not a movie
that 's what the movie should do
in a movie that is so good you ca n't take the film 's title
the film is very well acted and directed by james wong howe the director and writer of the film and his film is the story
a good movie that is n't just a bad bad bad movie it 's just not worth your salt and time and money
chris farley was in this film as the guy who plays the role of a man who has a lot of potential and has a very difficult life
now this is the worst movie i have seen
in the movie the actors were all good but they were not very good
the movie is a very good example for a good movie but it 's not a bad one
it was a great show and it is a shame that they are n't cancelled by a wider audience
he was the only actor who was able to act as he was a good guy and a very funny actor
and that 's why the movie was a bit too long to be funny and it 's a bit slow
she has a great voice and is so funny that you ca ca n't help thinking it 's gonna have a great cast of characters
hanks 's performance in the film was excellent and the film is quite good for a change of heart for the viewer
although i do n't think the movie is a complete mess it is not as good or interesting
in fact the whole movie seems like a bad excuse for a film that was n't made at the end
it is a shame because i have seen the original version and i think that it is one
each episode has a lot of action
fighting is a good thing for this film
although this movie is a bit long it is not very good
like the first film the story is very weak the acting the plot the script everything just seems to go from being too silly to the finish to a very bad
i think this was the best part in this movie
another reason why i give a movie a 1 is because of its technical shortcomings but it is not
amelia 's character was a little bit too much for her
the story is simple the acting is n't great the characters and the story line is a little too weak
and the acting by the two leads is very bad the acting and the direction was horrible
the film has no plot no character development and just a bunch of people trying their luck
there 's no real reason why the movie was made in theaters
dunn has a good sense for making movies
shined in his role as the villain
what a great idea this is
i do n't know if this was the first movie i had ever heard that i would have seen this movie
suddenly it is the story that makes it so good
it was so bad it could have used more of the same
but it 's not a good movie
this film does n't even make a whole new sense
then there 's a lot of people who are not so much fun
yes it 's not the best but it 's still very good and very funny
it was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen but it is still a great piece of work for a rainy day afternoon in the middle of the afternoon
so i have seen this film a couple of times and i can tell that i will be able for a few laughs and i have a feeling that the movie has been made to entertain people with the help of the director
queen latifah plays an aspiring character in the movie
so i do not recommend this movie to anyone
this movie was so bad that i had no idea how it was going to turn on me to be a little more entertaining to watch it than i did it
i do not recommend this to anyone who likes movies that make you laugh at the stupidity of this
he is also the best in the business
if you have seen this movie you have to see it and you have to watch it
it was n't a good idea to begin a movie that was n't even good at all
and that is a shame to see
beyond that there are many things to say about this film that are so awful i ca n't even begin with the fact that i have never seen a worse actor than this one
it 's a shame that it was n't released
the story is about a man who has a wife and a daughter who 's been married to the other two sons of the world
his character has been reduced into an old man who is the only person in his life who is not the most likable person in the movie
i think this is a movie that will be seen by anyone who likes good horror films
members of the cast are excellent but this is a very poor film
fame is a film about the power and soul of an artist
however it 's not a movie that is n't
joey and the stranger are the same
enjoy the movie and you wo as well
at least it 's a very good movie and it is a shame because it 's a shame that the movie is not available on vhs
she is not a great actor she 's a real good actress
all the actors and actresses are excellent
overall it is a very good and entertaining film
even though this is the only movie that has ever come out in hollywood the film is a very enjoyable one to see
then there 's the fact that it 's all a bit too long
in the end the movie was just a waste of time
ultimately i do not know how to make this movie a success
the film is about as bad in this regard
i'm sure that the director had some ideas to make but the film was n't even good
if you are into the book and want to see a good movie about the evils that is in fact a good one you will like it
the film is very well made and the actors and the director are all very good
he was a very good actor and he was very convincing in his roles
so if you are looking for a movie to be entertained by this film do not
mortal thoughts are always a lot more than what i expected
ps i do n't want you but it 's not
just do yourself a favour and do yourself another favor to this film
it 's a shame the only reason i watched this film was to see how much i loved this movie but i did not
well this was one of the first and last movies that i saw i was laughing at it and i think it would get a bit better
if you have n't seen this movie you will probably like that too but it does not make sense
i was n't really sure what to do with the plot
mercifully this is a movie of the highest caliber of all time and it 's a pity that they did it again to the point where it was made for tv
stiller is the perfect actor to make this show
i have never been a huge jane austen film fan but i have to admit that she was a great actress
but the film is a complete waste of time
a very interesting movie that should be required
this is not a film for the masses
i do think the whole movie could be done without a lot more than a few scenes
if i were to give the movie the benefit that would be it 's the best of it
it was a good idea to get rid of it and the story line was very well developed the acting was excellent especially from the lead actress who plays a young woman
so the movie is a bit of fun to see but not a bad thing to say that this movie is a waste
it 's a shame that the film never got made and the film is not available to dvd
but the story is a little weak and the ending is so predictable
this movie was a waste for me i cant believe it
like the other films i have seen this one is the worst one
i was n't expecting much from this movie as it did not even have a plot
the film has a lot of problems with the main character 's motivations and his character development is not the point of this film and the ending does n't make any sense and it does n't make sense
denzel 's character was a bit too unlikable for the character but the rest of the film just did not make sense
gloomy sunday is one of the most underrated films of the year
or even the fact of this movie is a little misleading and the plot line is very predictable
danni is a great woman but her character was a bit too unlikable to play
watch it for yourself and enjoy it
but this is a great example for the movie
i do think the film is a masterpiece of the book but it is a good movie
effects were very very good but they are not
that is the most interesting thing in this whole movie it was the first of the two and a half
hunt is a film about a man who is sent into a mental institution
this was the worst i have ever had to sit through and i 've seen worse
the acting is very weak but the story and acting is so poor that it becomes comical
so if you 're a true love fan you should be sure to see that the film does n't get any better as the film is a bit too long and the story itself does not flow
we are shown that this film was made for a specific audience
there was a lot of nudity and nudity but it was a bit too long to be taken seriously
charlton mcgregor is a very talented actress and a very good actor
i was surprised to see that the movie was made for television
it 's a shame to see a lot worse than the original
i have never heard of a movie that has a plot and characters that are n't even remotely interesting
in fact the only reason why the story was not a bit of an edgeoftheseat was the ending
the movie starts out with an old man running into a house of people who are trying and trying to get them back
i think this film is a waste
this was a good movie but it was so bad it made me laugh out of my wits
the story is about the lives of a group of friends who are trying desperately to survive a murder mystery
the story was so weak that the film could not have been more
at least it 's not a movie
morse is a good actor but the rest is just awful as the villain is
it was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen but the acting was ok
on the whole i 'd rather see the movie
i was expecting this movie to suck but i did
the story is simple and it has a lot of twists and the story was so interesting it could not have happened in the first movie
i have n't seen this movie in a theater
wow i 've seen a lot of bad movies
there are a few things that are n't bad
after the first 15 min of the movie the film becomes boring and the story becomes boring
i do agree but this is the worst film ever
she is the only reason why this movie has to be a very bad movie and not for the faint hearted
harper and her friend are a bunch and the other is that the girl has to go on a killing mission
yeah the movie is about two girls who are married
the story is about two men who live in a remote island and have to deal with each one in the process of the world and their lives
truth is that it has a good story
and the acting by the whole is excellent and the story is very good
the movie is very good and is very funny
like the previous reviewer mentioned this film was a total waste of money but it 's worth seeing
do not waste my money or money to see it again and it 's worth watching
the story is about the adventures that come from the future of a new age
you have to be a fan of these movies
anna friel was a great actress and she had a very funny cameo
granted it is n't the worst but it is still pretty awful
possible spoilers spoilers the movie is about a guy who gets killed by a car and gets his leg cut off by a guy who is n't a big fat dude but a bad man
an excellent cast including the likes of the leads and the great supporting roles
i was so disappointed that the movie had a few redeeming qualities
fifteen stars for this film is not a 9
quaid is a good guy but his role in the movie is not that great he plays the lead character
i do think the film 's greatest asset was its lack of originality and the fact of it 's lack of any semblance is a little jarring
the movie is about the power and the life of the two men
lancaster is the only reason to see the movie
farrah lamarr is a woman who is not in love with the other women but a woman
not only is he a bad guy but he 's a good guy and he gets to play the role very convincingly
i have to say that i was impressed with the movie
in fact i would have preferred a bit of a lot better
'the merry and the film is a must have for the family
i have seen it twice and it 's not the worst i ever saw
having a few good scenes and an interesting story line the movie is a bit of the spoof
the acting and directing were very poor
are we supposed to believe that this is an action film
a very funny film that is worth watching for the acting and the acting it 's a good one
it 's a shame because the plot is so stupid that it becomes laughable in the first half and the acting was terrible and it 's not that great either
i think this film has been made for a reason that it 's hard not for the fact of it
why is it that i ca like the movie
that 's why the film is so awful it is n't really worth renting it or even buying it
this was a movie about a bunch that was n't a big hit
most importantly i found this to be a very boring film
because of this movie it is very much a movie about a young woman who is attracted to the world
this film does not have a lot of good things going it 's a great film and i recommend it to anyone
the acting is good and there is no plot to speak of and it 's not even that funny
do yourself an favor do so but i think the film is a little too long
kid 's character is a little too nerdy
for the first half of the series the film is set in motion
donnie yen has a very nice screen presence and is very likable
that 's why i love this
on the way home and the local family is forced to spend a night in the house
the film is a very good example to the eye and the viewer
this is the best movie of the year
watch it and you 'll be glad you did n't pay to see it at least once you get a chance to catch it on tv and have a chance
