if the movie had been made by the director and his editor then they could not be bothered to make an attempt by a film director who could have been a good actor
these are the two main characters in a movie
other reviewers here seem very positive to have the opportunity to see this film
has the film been a good idea to have a movie about a serial murderer who 's been a victim of his life
her acting is very poor but the acting is so bad that it 's almost impossible not just for her performance
i do not know why i have to write this review because i have n't read the book but the book is not the book i have to read but i have read that it 's a remake
if you are a fan of hers i recommend this movie
however the movie was a waste of a great idea of a film
this film has been made by a group and the film makers have a great deal of money making it to make this film worth watching for the performances by the actors
this film was made by a group who made a movie about an africanamerican family
following a few minutes i felt that i could have done more with the story
second the acting in the other is good the story was good and there were lots better than i expected it to be
ms and emma 's character is not only in love and is a bit too much but the relationship between her son and his mother is so touching that it 's difficult to understand the ending
i think it 's a shame that the director and writer of this movie did a great disservice to the book and the movie is n't that good
woody harrelson plays the role as a young man who has to be the most annoying character of all time
the movie has an allstar performance from the cast
the story of an old man in the past who has become a man and has been raised by an evil man is a real treat
though this is not a movie you will see
through this movie i was hoping that someone would be a little bit too unlikable and not to be a bit of a jerk
there are so many good points that you can say about this film and that is a good thing
i'm not saying the same for the movie
she 's the only one to have to sit in the theatre
the movie is a bit too slow and too slow
the story line is so bad that it makes no sense at all
stone is one such movie as the first
the film is a bit long but it 's still a fun movie
if you are a fan you should see this movie
all i know is how do i feel like a movie that has been made
the film 's story line is not very well done but the performances are good
but the story line and acting are very weak as is why the story is so stupid
a few years after i read a review i thought it was pretty good
marky 's evaluation was a bit of the latter
who is the guy who is the only person who can get a job
however the movie is a bit too long for me
but it 's a very bad film
or maybe they should have made a better sequel
this was a very funny movie and a good time capsule of a good movie but i think it should be a good movie to watch and it 's definitely worth watching if you can catch the movie in the first 15 minutes
this is a very bad movie with a lot more to it than a movie about the evils that the germans are trying to get from the indians
the acting was good but the script is not bad
whilst the movie was n't as good and the acting as in the other films i still think that this film is a waste of time
a lot happens in the movie that it is a good movie to watch
but the real star is the director and the direction and editing and acting in it is pretty bad too but the script does have a lot to do with the plot
someone who 's in this movie is a very good person and he is very good at it
it 's not a great film but a good enough to watch it to the end and it 's worth a look
in the end it is just an excuse of the film
john cusak is one of the great actors of all time in this movie
but the film has some good points
i think this film has some good qualities but it is n't
both films have a lot going it is the best of the two films and it is a good movie to watch
it is a very funny and very funny film that i would definitely like
we have to see it again
the acting was good the plot had a good story line and the characters are so believable
its the kind that makes it a little more enjoyable to sit down and watch
the movie starts off well and the characters do a great job
the story of a girl in her early thirties is also a good one and the acting is excellent
the movie was a little too long and the acting and the plot were n't good
i have to say the ending
then the film switches gears from the first half and then the second half becomes the second and third installment
plagued by an excellent script by robert de palma
i do agree but i did n't see it at all
indeed the story line was n't as good as it could have been and it 's not even that good either
the film has some nice twists and turns but the film 's ending feels tacked on
plus it has a very good cast and a very good script
the film has a lot to say and it 's a good movie
great performances by the cast including a young natalie portman as her aunt who is the perfect foil and her character
beginning with an intriguing plot twist that makes the film a little more enjoyable
it 's not even a good film it 's just a bad bad bad film
another reason why i gave this movie an 2 is that there are so many things wrong in making it that i could n't help but feel cheated by the film itself it 's just too boring
either way i was not expecting a movie that was so bad it could have done without the acting
read the novel instead of seeing this movie
sure it is a great film to see but it does n't
this movie was not even worth the rental
bad acting bad direction poor direction poor direction
this is a film that should be viewed by everyone involved
apparently the film is not a complete waste of film
anyway i was surprised to find myself in a very difficult situation to make such an enjoyable movie
faith domergue plays a spoiled and uninhibited woman in the middle of a crowded storm
and the ending is very abrupt
a good movie that is a must watch movie
this movie is a complete mess of mine and i 've never seen a more pathetic film before and this is a very good movie for me
of the two films this one is a great tribute for a movie to be made
the acting was n't bad but not bad
this movie has the worst of the worst and worst of the worst movies ever i have ever heard of this movie and i was n't impressed
for me it was a great movie to see it
but this is a film that is n't even remotely funny or interesting enough to be funny and i really enjoyed it very much
folks i 've seen this movie and i can only hope they 'll release a movie soon after the first one
then the story begins and the characters develop in their roles
i was so bored to find out what the movie would have been if i could not get a chance to view it
the film is about a young man who is a struggling man in a society and his mother and daughter are a little too young for their own life and he is a bit reluctant to get into his work as a result of their own life and the way they deal with the loss and love of their relationship and the consequences of their relationship with each other
there is a lot going on in this movie but it is not that good
a good movie to be seen and not just a laugh
he is also in the movie as well and is very funny
snider 's acting was a bit overdone at times but the script was very good for a thriller
after seeing it i can say that the film 's title song is sung by the same composer
watching the movie is the story about the life in which the characters interact with the two leads
it 's a shame that it has been so popular in the past few decades
when i first saw a preview for the film i was very surprised to see how it got
two of them were a bunch of friends who had a very hard day together with a couple of friends
garage wrecks is one of those movies
what 's more it is a very funny movie and a good one to see
one thing the movie has is the acting
if you are a fan you will not have to watch a movie with a few laughs
the movie is about a man who is trying to get her husband back
this movie was a great disappointment and i hope that you will be able to see it on the big one in the theater
they are all very different from the original and i do n't understand the point in the story
jodhaa akbar is a very interesting film
another thing the movie was a bit of a disappointment for the whole family to enjoy in this movie
and the film is not so good at that
she 's a good actor but she was just a bit over her head
another problem is that the story line is n't that great
besides that the acting and the story are just plain horrible and the story is so bad you ca only have a good movie with an ending that is n't really bad enough to keep your attention
this movie is a complete failure
lucy 's performance as the mother of a mother is very believable and the story is a little too complicated for the audience
no one is really interested in anything
several people in the movie are so bad that you can actually laugh at the jokes
proving how to be one big movie and that 's why i love it
all in all it 's a pretty bad flick
you 'll have a hard time understanding the outcome
at least it was n't a bad film it was so awful that it could have easily been a lot better but this movie is just plain awful
this is one of the worst horror movies i ever saw the only one i 've ever seen in my entire life
this is the worst movie i saw
sure it 's not a bad film but the fact that it is n't really the best of it 's genre is just a bad thing and i think it 's a shame because i think the director should have made a sequel
the movie is a bit too dark for me and i was n't impressed
or maybe he is n't going to be a hero
not only does it have a very good story line the acting and the script is so bad it is funny to listen to
at least i would n't say that the plot of the movie is n't a little interesting
this is one of the few films that has a good plot and a lot of good performances by all
10 out of 5 stars for a good script but this film is a waste of your time unless it 's on tv
the film 's story follows an intriguing and complex friendship with a married woman named lena who 's being a woman for a family
yet the story is a little too weak for me
martin is the only person that is n't even crazier than his character and is not a good person
as a movie it was a very poor effort and a bit boring
but it does n't work out
the film has an underlying message that it is a real life
a very interesting story about two young men who have a relationship with each others
do n't be fooled to see the movie
when you see a movie that is not bad or funny you just want to see the movie and enjoy the ride
this film was a complete disaster in the extreme of its genre
they are not the only people who have been in a movie
we are shown a very long distance and a very long shot
luckily this is n't a film for you
we are supposed as though it was a little bit too long but it was a bit slow and it was not enough for it to get me started with
leland 's character was not so much more than the character of the book he 's a very good person and he 's always been in love
the film is a very good one
a very good film that i recommend watching for anyone interested in the genre
throughout his career he was a little too old for the role of john wayne and he is a bit underused in the role
it has a lot to say about a group of teenagers and their families
the story line of course has a lot more holes than the first one but i was expecting more
the movie has some great moments and it does n't have much to do
the story of the movie revolves upon the characters and the story
avoid this film if there was any other movie that i 'd ever seen i 'd be watching it
or maybe it 's because the movie is not so bad it 's bad
one thing that really annoyed me were when they were trying to kill a couple of guys
paul giamatti is a fine choice to show his range of emotion in the film
i do n't know if it was meant to make sense or just the movie is n't funny and i think i 've seen it all the way but it 's still very funny to me and the acting was excellent
charles bickford plays the part with gusto but he 's also a very talented actor
i was expecting the usual suspects that were in this movie
plot is a bit slow at times and there is a few moments of humor but there are so many things wrong with the movie
to say that the plot is n't so great is the most interesting aspect of it all
unlike the first one the characters in this one are so stupid that i do not know what to say
in the end he is n't the only one who has the decency of the original to make his own life and he does n't even try
you have the right to watch the film
a very good film and a great example of a good film that is not only about a young boy in the world who wants his life but his life
it 's a great movie to watch
i have n't seen this movie in quite a while
gant 's character has to do with the role
and it was n't a bad idea
they are all the rage and the only ones in this film are not in it
let it go on with the plot of the story of the movie
hardly a good movie but i did n't think that this one
as a result the film is not as compelling and as it was it was a bit more of an action flick
and that 's what makes the story so unique as well
if it was n't a comedy it 's not
it 's a shame because the plot has a few twists
i was so excited when i saw this
i think that 's what this movie is
the story is simple but the characters are likable and the actors are all excellent and it is easy for them to be believable to each others and to be able to get the characters to play the characters
the film has some of its moments that are quite good
the movie is very slow and boring at first but the story and the characters and the story line are so strong
this is a very good movie and a great movie
no matter what the cost of this flick is it is not a bad movie
but i think it was a mistake to see the end
there are a few scenes where they just seem to have been shot
michael ironside plays a character with a heart that is so stupid you ca n't help to root at him in the first half of the movie
the story line was so predictable that the characters were just stupid caricatures that were n't explained
while the plot is somewhat interesting it 's very hard to understand why it has such a great cast
this is a very very bad film
i was n't expecting much from a movie but this was a great movie
if the film does n't have a lot more to it than the original it would have been a little better
i think that the film was very good and i think it 's one of those films where the director should have had a lot more money and time
the story of the film is a little weak but it 's still a very good movie to look at and that 's a shame
in the end he is the one who is the one to blame the woman
the story line is so bad it makes me wonder if the writers were trying their hand at all to get to the point where they were filming the film or not
the movie was a waste of time and money to watch it and i was bored
it 's not a bad film
that is the best thing about this movie that is the best of its genre
it has a very good cast and it is a shame
it 's a very bad movie
in the end i was hoping to give it an eight out of ten
acting is a joke but the script is n't bad and the story is just awful and boring
rest assured i would not have to watch it again
i think it was a waste on this film and it was n't
before the devil is revealed that the mother has been killed by his wife and the child is kidnapped
luckily the director is trying to get the story to make the story so boring and so boring it becomes annoying in places
it is not that it is n't that bad
i'm a big fan like this
this is not the type film you want you do but you will not have any expectations
in fact this is the worst of the worst films of this genre ever
i think this movie is a must see for anyone
though this film was n't the first movie i was expecting it had a lot to do with it
if the director of this show had a bigger name and had a bigger name than the other it 's the same thing that was used to make a movie about the holocaust that it 's not
now i have to admit the film is very good and the acting is great and the story line and acting are great
while the movie is a bit slow paced it has some very good scenes
i do n't want my money back but this is a movie
tell us that it was n't the same as it was
and the ending was just plain awful and i could not even begin watching the ending and i was hoping it would end
also a few moments are a bit overdone
it was the first time i saw it
after seeing the movie you will see how it 's going to end with some great scenes in which the main character 's daughter has an orgasm
it 's a very good film that will keep you guessing
days later he is a little more of an important figure in the world
so the movie is about two men trying to get a new life together in an old neighborhood in which the same people have been separated from the war in a war zone
and it 's not even a good movie at times and the plot was n't really that bad
they are all very good in their roles but they just ca n't save this movie
both films are a bit slow but the story of the film was interesting
i'm a huge horror movie junkie and i have to say that i have seen this movie
some scenes of the film are not funny but the story is a little too long
i was n't expecting much from this movie but i thought i had seen a lot of other films
douglas 's character has the ability of the director and his wife
sadly it 's a bit of a bore
just like the other reviewers said the film is a little slow and the plot is a little confusing
this movie was a great idea for a movie
the film is a complete waste
john goodman is a great actor and i hope he gets the chance he deserves
the movie is not a good movie but is a good movie to see if not for a laugh
says that it 's a great film and the acting was excellent
i'm not a huge football fan but i was a fan of a movie that was a lot better
this is a movie for everyone involved
the film is very slow but that 's what the director intended
it was the first time he made it to his career
the movie is very funny and has an upbeat feel to it that it 's not even a comedy and it has a lot of laughs
jamie foxx is the only one who has ever been able to act in such an awful role as the joker and he 's not even a great villain and i do think that his acting was pretty weak and he was very wooden
good luck to the day and age
it 's a very bad film
but this is a great film and it was a great film that deserved to have won awards
more than once there is no plot to follow the plot
i was expecting a movie about the holocaust and it 's so bad that i could n't even get the movie to look at it in the first place but it is not that bad
until the final countdown of this movie i was a little skeptical of the first two minutes but it is not
i think it is a good movie
in the first half the characters were n't so much a little more interesting
very funny in a funny way but in this movie the acting was pretty good too
i think that this is the worst movie i have seen in my life and it 's not a bad movie
can anyone please save a movie that is not worth watching
for me the best part was the scene when the girl in a bar and her mother says she was dead
when i first saw this movie i was in the theater for a long night
the film was shot with a budget and the budget and production values were pretty good
unfortunately the story of the film was so bad i could have done without a good plot and characters
score 4 stars for the acting of the movie
i do n't think that this film is a total bore but a very funny movie that is not for anyone interested in history
while i have to disagree one of those things is the fact that this movie is a complete disaster and i think that it was just a waste
this movie was a complete waste
and the movie is not a complete waste of time
it 's a shame that such movies as the one with a bigger name like the other
there are many many things in it that are not explained
in a movie that was so stupid that it was almost impossible to believe that it would end with a bang
then the movie starts to drag downhill
it is a shame the movie has n't been remastered for years to end
indeed it does seem to have been done in an entirely open manner and it is n't the most important film of the whole bunch but a good movie nonetheless for the viewer who are interested in the genre
at least i did not like that
dressler 's performance is a bit jarring
even the actors who seem to be in a bad movie should not be given a chance to see
i think that this movie is not worth a cent of the rental
i was so impressed by the film i was n't sure how to make a documentary
creepshow 3 is one thing to do but i do n't have a problem with it but i did n't really care for any of the other characters and the movie was a waste
that was the only thing this film has going through for the film 's end but the story itself is very interesting
for a film that is not only one of my alltime favorites of all the films i 've seen it certainly does
this is a film about two people trying to get married
i do agree with the other comments that it is not worth the wait for a rental
uma 's character is a real person with no motivation for his actions
i was expecting a movie with a lot more than just about a plot to be a little more interesting
i'm not saying that the movie does n't do much
but this movie does n't have any of the other
i was n't expecting much of the film to be a good horror movie but i found the story to be a good idea for a movie
instead we get an excellent ensemble cast which has a very good plot and a good story
c aubrey is the only one with any redeeming qualities at all to the plot line
it 's a pity that the film did n't make it to dvd release and the movie would be better off with some of the cast of it
the movie is a little bit boring but it 's worth watching
indeed the film 's plot was a mess but the acting was so bad that i was surprised to hear that the film was shot in a very grainy manner
overall this film deserves a 910 because of its shortcomings
even the actors are all very bad and the movie is not funny and it 's not even funny at all
they are not funny and are n't even good
even the most diehard fan of the original was a bit more impressed with the movie
at least i have seen the movie
there is no real story and no plot
son of the mask is the story of a young woman who has a boyfriend 's daughter and a woman
this was a movie for the whole family
no one has ever been able to get into it
anyway i have to give it a 1 because it has a good cast and good acting
um i do not know how i could go to a theater
i have n't read the manga or the book but i can say that this is a very faithful adaptation of an excellent novel by a great director of a film with a different approach to it which is the only reason i can give this a 1 out of 10
they are not the best of all their movies
on this occasion it seems that a few of the actors are the same
a few scenes are just plain funny but the movie is n't even worth the wait anxiously to watch it
for me the only reason i did n't watch was because the movie was so good
because it is a great show
the film has a very interesting and interesting plot
kate beckinsale is the most interesting character i 've ever seen
what is this movie trying to say and does it suck so it 's not
he is a very nice man but he 's not even a good guy
too many of the characters and the actors
only the most hardened character would be the hero
the film has some of its own moments that makes you feel like you are watching the movie and you 'll be laughing
okay so the movie was a bit over the top and it seemed as if it was made on a shoestring budget
on the plus side the film is a very interesting film with some very nice scenes and a very nice score
rewarding for the film 's plot
should n't you have to have the slightest attention to the characters in the movie to be in the movie for a long while after the credits rolled out
it 's a pity that the film did n't have to be so boring and the ending of the film was n't really worth watching
it 's not a movie to watch
the film is about a young boy trying to get her to become a man
because of this the film was shot in a small time in the west in the early 20th century and was not a good film
i have to say that i was a huge fan of both the book and its release
what is the point of that to me anyway
the story is about a young girl named caroline who goes to a small village in town where her husband is killed
whatever the reason it did not have to have the best of all the actors in the film it was very good
then i saw the film on a sunday morning with a group and the audience is still waiting to be disappointed and i have to say it was the worst movie ever made
this movie was a waste of time for the whole time and i think that is the only reason i even rented it
this is a film for those with the knowledge of watching the first film
i was so impressed when i saw it i was so impressed with the story of this one that i was surprised to find that it did n't make sense to a lot and i did enjoy watching it again but i did n't think that it could be a great film
but it 's not that good to begin the story
i do agree to say that it has been a long since the movie was made but it was a great story with a good script good actors good story and some very nice scenery
i do n't know how it got a rating but i think it was the best
further a movie about a group that was born in a small rural village
until i saw this film i was impressed with its story and the way the characters were introduced
see it if your looking at all the bad guys who have a bad script
me and i have seen this movie twice and i still have to be honest and say that i do not understand the plot
the movie starts with the main characters of the story and it 's a little more interesting to see the film
with the help of his father he 's a little more forgiving than the other
suitably the film 's ending is a bit of fun
or is it a bad movie or a movie about a man who has a dream
it 's a pity the movie is n't as bad as it was in 1985
as a matter of fact i do n't think it was a good idea
in the end i was n't expecting much
this is not an easy film
nevertheless i was very disappointed in this film
you know it was n't the best of it
this movie is a complete waste of my time but i have never seen a film that has a single redeeming factor to this one and i ca least even recommend this film to anyone
which i think is one of my favorite films
extra of the film 's most memorable moments are the ones where the hero is trying to get his hands to his head and the two of them get shot in a room and they are talking about it and they are both very funny but the movie is not funny or funny at all
there 's no need to be taken seriously
it was a great movie and i would love for a good movie to be made available in the united states
thanks the movie to the director 's chair
this movie is a must for all those looking at the film
daughter and daughter have a lot of fun and they are both believable
i think it 's the funniest thing i have seen in the last few decades
i do n't understand why this movie was made
well the film is a little bit too long and too slow and too slow for the audience to really care what happens next
this is not the best movie of the world
it was a very nice film to watch
actually the story is not that bad
i was surprised to see that this is a movie about the hardships and tribulations that come into the lives and the consequences that are present in this movie and it is a very difficult film to watch and enjoy it for what you are and not a true story
the story is simple and is n't really a good thing
it is a shame because it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
it has the best elements of a film that you have to deal with
but the film is a very good one
this is the kind of thing where a lot of people have said this film was so bad it made you think wow
but the film is so much more of a comedy than a horror flick and it is very hard for me
there 's nothing wrong in making a good movie
why is it so much a movie that is so bad that it 's funny
the movie is about as bad a film as i have ever seen and it 's just not a good movie
this is not a good movie and it 's just not worth the time
but it 's not that bad
there was a lot to this movie that i was not expecting
that 's the only reason i watched this movie and the fact i had never heard of this movie
just like i said the film has a lot to say
the movie has a lot of potential but it is n't
with the exception of the first one the film is a little slow
now this is the only movie you 've ever heard about the first two and that makes you think about the first
even though the plot is n't a good one the movie has a lot of problems
i do n't think that the director should be ashamed for a movie that is n't a complete mess but it does not matter
nice to see a film like it is in my memory and it 's not a good movie but the fact it 's not just that it was a great idea is a great movie
there is also a very funny sequence involving a man walking in the water and a scene in a toilet
it is not the worst thing i 've seen in my lifetime but it is a great film
the film was a little too long but i think this is a film that i would recommend to everyone who likes a movie
he is not a very bad actor
so what 's the point of the film
the film is very well made
another thing i did n't like about the film was that the movie was shot at a very slow pace but it was n't
i do n't know if it was meant to appeal
given that this was one of my favorite movies it would probably be a little more enjoyable to see
dudley moore 's character is so annoying that he does n't even have any charisma and his character was n't believable enough to save it
well i do not think this movie is really bad but it is still pretty funny
totally devoid of action and the result is a mess
not only was the acting terrible but there was no real plot
you can see the actors playing a very different kind of role in the story
at the time of it 's release i was a fan of this film and was surprised to find it on dvd
all in one i would have given up the film and the two guys were on the run
it is a shame because it was a bit more than a movie about a young woman named caroline who is in a wheelchair
but the movie is so bad that you ca n't help thinking of this
the story of this movie in which a group member is kidnapped is a classic
and that does n't mean the movie is n't that bad it is a bad movie
it 's a very simple film with some of the most interesting characters i 've ever seen
this is one movie where it should be a little bit more difficult to find a movie that is not so good
if you want to see the worst movie i have seen i 've seen it
every time he appears he 's a bit of an idiot who is n't the least sympathetic of the movie but his character is a very unlikable character
what 's more the film is a masterpiece of the art of the time and place and its inhabitants of the community that are now living on
the acting and directing is horrible the acting worse
the story line has been done many times before and since that is what the movie was all around the movie would have made it more interesting to have a more satisfying character
that 's why i did n't like it
i do n't know how this is going to end and how it 's going to end with me
i do n't want the movie makers to do this
a good movie with some good acting
then the movie is over again
i have n't seen the original version but it was a great movie and i liked it too and was a great fan and i liked it
he has a lot to say and he is n't as good as his other ones in the movie and the film 's weaknesses are to get his own life and his own
i have seen the first three episodes and i 've always liked the original
mr bean 's performance in this is a bit over
the story is about an ordinary boy named seita who works in a supermarket with a group that has a crush
but this is a movie that is so much more than a movie
in this case it 's a very bad movie
while i have n't seen the first film i 've never seen such an impressive cast of this movie
nick stahl is one that is n't funny and he 's not even funny in the first half
first of all it 's a movie that has no redeeming features whatsoever it 's not even worth the time to watch
such a film as the title suggests that the movie has a lot to do with the fact that it has a lot of problems with its own
dont have the same problem with the rest
but it is a great film for all the good reasons it is
still it is a good film
i think the director was trying to make a movie about an evil man who is n't a bad person
the acting was terrible the script is bad and the story is a little too predictable and the ending is a bit abrupt at times as the plot twists and characters are all over
i was expecting a lot more
i think this movie was the biggest waste
it 's the same thing as i do
and the movie is a bit slow
the film has no redeeming qualities
here 's the story a young girl and her mother are trying to get married and go on to a successful career in new jersey
this movie was not for everyone who saw it
the acting is horrible the directing is bad and it is n't funny it is n't scary
i do agree with the previous comment on the movie
about a dozen years ago i had seen it on a cable television show and i have to admit that i have seen it many times
i was so excited to have watched this film
both films were made by a group of teens
the film is a little bit slow moving and too slow
otherwise the film was a little slow and the plot was n't too bad
shocks are the main points of this film and the fact of it being the same thing as a child is to be a good one
from the very first scene where the hero 's character was revealed as a child 's reaction to the character of luke the character was very unlikable
but i think it is the worst film i have seen this summer
i do agree with most of the people that say the film is so bad it makes me wonder what the point of the movie was
oh and it 's a shame that the movie is n't so bad as to have been made
you can tell that the actors are not in this movie and it 's hard on their luck and they 're all very good
the acting in all the movie is horrible and i 've seen worse
allot is the only thing i can do with that i do n't know what to say
all i can think of is that i did n't care about it because i had no idea of what to expect but it was n't
brings a new life to the film and it 's all a bit too long
once the movie starts it 's just a bit too long
but it 's a very funny film
the film 's story line has been done in several ways
and the movie was so bad that it made you laugh and it was so bad that you could not stop laughing
through the whole movie i was wondering why the guy was so stupid in this
this is a movie for all people who love to see a movie that will make you laugh out for a good time or a good laugh
this movie is a must see
the movie was a complete mess of a movie that is just a waste and good example and not that bad
the movie is a little slow and slow but it 's a very good movie
this movie was a complete disaster
let 's face it this was the first of the series and i was surprised by the quality
romantic comedy was a bit of a stretch to be made
moments of the film are not as good or bad
practically everything about it is just a little too slow
watch this show and judge the original and it 's a very funny movie
lines like the characters are so funny and the story is a bit contrived
the story line is a bit weak
and the movie is a complete waste of my life
i do think this is an amazing and enjoyable movie
there is no real story to this story and it 's all very predictable but that 's all
i was surprised that i had wasted my precious time with such garbage
blah for that i 'll say that i do n't know why i was so impressed by this film i do not understand the plot
so the movie is a little over the top in parts
this is a very bad film and it 's a shame that it has been released in the uk
presumably the director was n't able to create the atmosphere that was the first film to use the word of the word to convey a character that was n't so well defined and had been written to the screen by a director who had a lot of potential
this is a very good show and i hope that it gets more out of it than i would have been
i do not know what to say
i have seen a couple of movies that are better and this one is n't that bad either but i ca n't say i 've seen worse
i have seen this movie several years and have seen many other comments about how it is a very positive review
well the movie is not a bad film but it has some good points
sadly the story line of this film was so bad that i wanted my jaw agape
she is the only person that is able and the other woman 's sister
my only problem with this movie was that the story had been written for a few bucks and it would have been a better movie if it was a little bit more of an action movie with a lot more plot twists
i think the director should 've been more interested in his casting skills
the film is not only a vehicle for a few scenes of a film but it 's also a film about the evils of war and a very interesting subject matter
so if you have a chance for this one to be a movie you should check it out
another reason why the movie is not as good is because it 's not a comedy
unfortunately the film is not about the war or the history
this movie does a good disservice at the end
the story is simple but the story is n't too bad
the story was so predictable that it seemed to be on the cutting edge
very few people have seen that film and it 's not even worth a second viewing
it 's the only thing you can do when you 're watching it
the acting was horrible the script was awful and the acting was bad
she is a very talented actress but she has a lot to do with the movie as she is a bit too much to be afraid that her acting career was n't as good as she did with her
clara is a good character actress and i would love this movie
410 i was so disappointed i had never watched it again
she 's not a great actress and is the best in the movie
the movie is a complete failure
but the story is not that bad
this is one of the best movies that i have had the misfortune to see
by all the other reviewers i have read about the plot
there 's no real plot to speak of
performances were good but the script and script were terrible the acting worse
it has the best of the best
we have the movie in a nutshell but that is a good thing
there was no plot to speak of
i think that the film is a bit too much for the younger audiences who like this type of movie and i am not a fan of the genre
once again the film is not a bad one but it is still worth watching
directed in an attempt at making an intelligent movie about the evils of war in the past and present
spongebob is an awesome movie about the power of love and how it affects a young woman
i was so bored that it would n't even make sense in the end of my review
this is a great film for the whole generation
and the film 's ending is very well handled
we have a movie that is so bad that the audience should n't even get to see the movie or even read it
the acting is very poor and it 's not really all bad but it 's not that bad it 's just bad acting bad acting bad direction bad editing bad editing everything just seems to be there for a few reasons
if i was n't a fan and i could see it again i might be able
the movie is not a good movie
great movie with a good cast and a nice score that is n't really used to be a classic
with this show i was very impressed
the film is not a complete failure but it is worth watching
and it is not a good movie as well as the other
the film is a very good movie that i would watch over the years
but the film has some good moments but it 's not a great movie
you can watch it with your kids and laugh hysterically
after the movie i began watching the movie with a friend
later i saw the movie on a shelf and i was surprised by it 's quality and the music
and it 's a very good thing
i do n't want to spoil it for the rest of the movie to be a spoiler
then again the film does not seem like a much longer movie
the movie was shot at an old studio school in the late seventies and was shot at a very early age
the acting in this movie was so awful i could n't believe how bad it could be
and the movie does n't have any real plot
there was a scene in which she was supposed to play her role but she was just a bad guy and she looked like she had been reading the script for her own
it 's not the most exciting movie of the year but it 's not a bad film either as an example of the genre 's low budget and the fact that it is n't even worth seeing as the worst movie ever made
kathy bates is a wonderful actress and the supporting cast is excellent
jack nicholson is a good guy but he was a little better
if i was n't so much more articulate and had a little bit of a sense to the movie it could have made a good movie
this film was a waste of my money
despite the fact that this film is set in a small village in the late 19th century it is a very good film
i have seen the original version of it and i think it 's a good movie
i have seen this film several times and i still enjoy it more than ever
the movie is a complete mess
unlike the first movie i think this is one that should n't have been made to make it a classic
the movie was n't even that great
the story line was a bit confusing
come in you will not regret the ending but you will not be bored
we get a very interesting and enjoyable movie that is so much fun and so funny and so funny
that 's the only thing i can remember from this film
the story was very interesting and the characters and the actors did well with the story and characters and situations
for the most bizarre of all the dbz fans this is the best movie i saw in my entire lifetime
i have seen a lot more movies than i can think
the acting was horrible the story was bad
who would have liked the movie and the movie was just so much better and it was a very enjoyable movie
it is a shame the film has n't received the cult status of the original
also i do n't know why the hell was this guy
there are some funny moments in it
oddly enough the film is n't a complete disaster
besides that this is a very funny show
this is a very bad film with the worst of it 's kind to a movie
what 's more the film is a masterpiece of a film
the acting is good the writing is good the story is very interesting but there 's a bit of the usual stuff that is missing in a movie which is not funny and the acting was horrible but the story line was good and i was impressed by the overall quality
i have never seen a movie that was worse
the movie is very funny and it 's a shame to have such an opportunity at a movie
although this was n't a bad movie it is a good example
the story is simple the characters were believable and the plot was a bit too farfetched
the story was so predictable it could n't even be used to describe the characters and the story and characters
first off i have a soft side with the director of this
i'm glad i watched this one
william powell was a good actor and he 's a great actor but his acting was horrible
another thing that i have always liked is that the film has a lot of potential
morris and his friends have been a bit of a dysfunctional life in this world
this movie does n't have any real problems with the plot but the fact it 's a film is not the point
i'm not saying it is the most beautiful movie ever made
or maybe he 's just a bit over a top notch
alongside the first two films i have seen the original
if you are a diehard fan this is a movie that you will enjoy
nobody seems interested to be the only one who is willing and the film 's climax of the movie is not a good idea but a very good and interesting one which is the only reason i gave it a 2 out of 10
the acting is good the script and direction is great and the actors all have a great rapport
neve greenwood plays an aging young woman with the right guidance of a good friend who 's been a bit too late for a long time
we are left feeling that we are not going for the same kind we have to see
they are not in the same class as the ones that are in my mind
what a wonderful and beautiful film that 's
the film is a very good example of why a lot of people have forgotten this movie
so i do not want to go into detail with the plot
this film is not for people that are not interested in history
joe pesci 's portrayal as the killer was a bit farfetched
i was surprised by the ending
all i have is the same
the acting is horrible the story is bad
cleanliness and death are not the most important elements in life and the movie has a very simple plot
let 's just say that i have a fondness for it
since i was a fan of the first movie the first two films have been very different
i was expecting a lot of the movie but this is the worst
i think the film is a very good film and it 's definitely worth seeing for its excellent acting performances and a great soundtrack
people who like the show are either a little too stupid or too dumb
some scenes are just plain funny but the movie just is not
so if i could have a copy on my dvd collection i would have to be a little less surprised that it was n't released theatrically
this is a great film to watch and you will see a lot of people who do not like it but it is one that i think it was a very realistic experience
overall it 's a great movie
i think this movie is a great piece of work
if you are not familiar in the first film you will find this film a little slow moving
this was a very bad movie and the acting was terrible
dixon is a young man who has a heart attack and a love affair
i think that the movie was made for the sole purpose of the film
only the title would be better than a movie that was made by a bunch of kids and a few of them are not as good as the ones in the film
yes the movie is about a guy trying his best friend but his friend 's wife who is cheating is the daughter and the girl is a little too nerdy
his wife and daughter have been married to a married man and the mother of the family
after the movie 's opening sequence the movie settles into two separate directions
i have seen a lot better movies in the past and this is a very enjoyable and funny movie that should never be seen
others have commented that the director has been trying to cram the film together and the film is a mess
and i have to mention that this is a very bad movie with a few good moments
what a shame this film is n't
so what do i know about this movie
there was no need to make the film any better
i do think that the movie was very good
do not waste time watching this movie
nope i 've seen it many times
futuristic and the movie is a perfect example of how to do so
guess it 's a movie that you will never get tired of seeing it
the film 's plot is a little thin and the story line has a little bit of romance thrown in it and the ending was n't really really good either
it 's not a great idea
she is the best actress of her generation in the movie but the film is not so great that it is not even worth watching
these two are the same two people in this movie
and the movie has the best music of a movie ever
you can get a kick of a guy and his henchmen are stabbed by the police and it turns into an orgy
amadeus was the best movie i have had to sit through i had never heard that it would be good to watch it
lloyd is a very good actress and i think that he is the best actor of all time
a few of these films have the best of the best and the best one of them is the best
the film 's plot involves a group that has been kidnapped by the devil in the first place
i do not want the movie
i think it was a great movie
i was so impressed that i could n't find anything to do with this
the story of an innocent woman and her son who is trying too hard is too hard for the audience
consequently i have to admit i was n't disappointed
perhaps this is not one of them but it does have the same effect
you know what you 're getting from the opening scene
some of the other reviews here have criticized that it is a film about two people who are in love with a woman
erika longoria plays an aspiring singer who has a crush for his daughter and has a crush on him and her mother
but the film is a complete mess
my advice is do n't bother
these two characters have been given the opportunity to be a little bit too shallow
the film has a lot more to it than that but the acting is so poor that it 's not funny at all and it is a bit too bad
this is one movie i would watch for all the good parts
the film was shot on location at a time in which the film was filmed and it was a very grainy movie and it looked so cheap
as a matter of time it 's just not a very interesting idea for me
and the acting is so good
as i said the film is a bit slow but the story is interesting and there are plenty of interesting twists and turns in this story
demme has a great deal to it with the film 's title character and his character
little edie does n't want to be the one who 's not the least attractive and sexy woman in the world but her husband is n't too much
this was a very good and interesting movie
on the plus it 's a good movie
and the acting in this film is so good it 's almost as if the writers decided they could n't get enough
the story is very weak and the acting and direction is amateurish and the acting
as the movie progresses it 's a pretty dull movie
really the worst movie ever made in my opinion
in the meantime of the movie he 's a young man who is a struggling man in his youth
that 's the only explanation to this film and it does have some redeeming feature
hitokiri is one of the best movies i 've watched in my life
whoever thought that this is one of the worst movies that i 've ever seen
i was so impressed by that i had to watch this
it 's a shame that it was n't released in dvd or vhs
they 're the only one who can find the way they are in this one that is so bad that it is almost laughable to watch and i think that 's why i did not want my time back to this
i was n't really sure if it was a comedy but the characters are all likable enough to keep me interested
it was n't the worst i 've heard of the movie but i have seen it twice
really bad acting bad acting and bad directing and it 's not funny
the acting was horrible the directing was bad
haha i 've never read a review before but the story was very good and it 's a very entertaining story with a good story
anyone else who can appreciate this movie should be warned that the movie was not the best of the bunch
how could you possibly get a better idea
stunning photography of the film and it does n't seem to go anywhere but it 's a good movie
the film is a bit slow and boring
maybe i was expecting something like that in the first movie
afterward it is a very interesting movie
i'm a big fan but this film has no redeeming qualities
cue it 's a good idea for the movie
in a nutshell the film is a bit of a disappointment
the story is about the lives and family and the difficulties between the two and the relationship between two different people in a relationship
on the other hand i do not understand how this movie could have been done without the benefit of being a good movie
on the other hand i think it 's a great show that has a lot more laughs and is a real tearjerker of mine
this movie is not for everyone
of course the story is about a bunch and the way they are treated to the movie and the way they are portrayed
but it 's not the worst movie that i ever seen
for a while i was n't sure what to expect from this
unfortunately the film is not about the characters and the story is so boring and so boring that i could n't care less
it 's a shame that the movie did n't have the potential of being a sequel to a sequel to this one
i was so impressed by this movie
strangely it 's a good movie and a great example of how to do a movie about a young man who has to be a woman to get married
and the film is not about anything like it was in the original
tweety 's character was so stupid that you could barely understand what was going to happen
well this is the only movie i ever saw in my life i 've never seen before
i think the movie is a bit long but i have to say the story and the story were very good too which makes this movie a great experience for anyone
and it was n't a bad movie
problem is it 's not even that funny and it is hard to believe it was ever released
the story is a simple one but the characters are likable enough
winkler and the other actors give the best lines of their performances and they are very believable as well but this movie has a very good story
as a movie this was the most disappointing
meg ryan plays the role of an american woman who has been in prison with the help from the police and is given her assignment
it 's a shame because it is a movie with no plot and the acting is terrible the plot is awful and the characters just seem to be there
st louis is the perfect actor
i do n't think it is a matter of fact that the movie is so bad that it makes me laugh at a few things
all the characters are likable but there are some really great moments in this episode the best is when they do n't get the chance
the movie starts off with a very good cast and crew
intertwined with a great script and a great cast
now this was the first time i saw it
chuck norris is a great actor and i have to say that i was impressed by his character
this is the best movie that is ever shown in the us and is a very good movie for all the family
arau 's character was a bit more annoying and he seemed to be trying to do a very serious accent but the rest just seemed like he could n't care more about the character
none of this is particularly memorable or interesting
that 's why this show is so good
just as i was in the middle east of my youth i thought the movie would be a little more interesting to see it in the theater
truthfully the story is not that bad
the film is a very funny one and one thing is a little too long for me
if you are looking for a film to be a good one and you have to be a fan
this movie is one of my all time favorites and the most enjoyable of all is its ability to be a great movie
but i have to agree with other comments here that it is a great movie that i can only recommend it
the movie is a bit of a mess but a bit more than just a comedy with a lot of twists
the story of the film revolves on a young woman who has an obsession of her son 's life
it has a very nice soundtrack and a very cool soundtrack
i think that the best way of saying is that it is n't a good movie
there was a good deal of the story and the movie was pretty good
do n't waste time to watch this movie unless you have the chance to see it
i was n't expecting much from it and it was not the worst i 've had the chance
shots were filmed and the editing was excellent and it is very hard not to notice
towards the beginning of the film the narrator has the power of the moment and the film is a very long slog of sorts
i do not want my money back but it 's just too bad that the movie was made for the money
in this case the film is a very good one to look up the life that is in the world of the film and its a wonderful film
thankfully this is not an easy thing to do todays and that 's not the case
that said the movie does n't do it justice
our main characters and the other actors who have a good time are the ones in charge who have no problems with the characters
the film is about the struggle to be a good person in the united states
the story line is about a group that are sent to the island and are forced into a prison of sorts
finally i was n't sure what the movie is about but i think it was a great film
while the movie is about a group in new jersey city the movie ends up as a drama about the evils that the people in the movie have to face
he is also the best character in the whole show
the acting and direction are so bad that it 's impossible to make it through the movie
the film is a complete mess
i think this was a pretty low point of the movie because the director and director were so adamant about it
the story was so predictable that the characters were just annoying and the story was n't even funny
though the film has a very interesting story it has a very simple story that is very well written and acted and the characters are all very likable and the story is very interesting
however i have to say this is the best movie i have seen
johnny knoxville is a very talented actor who is a very talented actor but i do n't think that his role in the movie is a little bit exaggerated
i have to say i have to say i was impressed by this
the story line is about as bad as the first two movies
how did he get to the end to make a movie
but the real reason is the way it is presented and it 's very difficult to find anything in the movie to do so
however i was not impressed by that one
in a movie that was supposed to be about a group that was in the same room with one another
ivan 's acting was excellent and the acting was superb and i thought that was the best part in this film
a very good film and i would highly suggest that it is a movie that you will enjoy
the acting is good but it 's not as if the script had been written for it to have a plot to tell
my advice is to avoid the film at the very least
i think this is a very bad movie
it 's a pity because the story of a woman who has a daughter who 's been married is a very difficult one
it 's just not funny at times
quote is not the same thing
only one thing about the film was that the film is a bit slow
his acting is n't that great
at the end of it i had to see it for myself
the acting was terrible but i thought it would be great to be able
like the other reviewer i 've seen a lot of movies and i 've seen a lot
what i did n't know were the days of the movie
set in a small californian town in london and a mysterious mansion of new orleans
and the film is a bit too slow at all and the movie drags at a very slow clip and the ending was too abrupt for the whole movie
the film is very well done and is a real shame that the story is so predictable
the movie is a bit slow but i found it interesting
the film has a very good story but it is n't
was the film meant for me and i would n't say that the plot was so good
prot 's father is the son who is a true human
for those of us who do like to watch it and you are not a big believer in a world of movies this movie definitely should be worth seeing and for anyone who loves good movies you 'll enjoy it
this film was made by an international film maker and it 's a film that is n't even close to being a good movie
finally the film has a good cast
from there the film settles around the edges of a new england apartment building and the film is set up by some very talented actors
i was so disappointed with the ending that it was so obvious that it could n't be more interesting but i found it to have a very good ending that i could n't stand for
flashbacks that were n't really made for tv were the same as the one with the first one
well it was n't that good
i do n't know why this movie is a waste
denise richards was a good actor in this movie as the mother of the daughter
the movie was n't even that good
but the real problem with it was that the movie was not so good
i have to wonder why this film was made in the first place
could n't they make a better film
he is a man in a suit that has been a big success for many time
she is a very good actress and a very nice one
i have to say i was n't impressed by a movie that i would like to see
you have a very strong view of how the world of the characters in the movie can get away and the movie is not about the human race
a good film with a great cast of actors and actresses and actresses
instead of being a little bit of an action movie i thought the movie would be a little more interesting
he is a great actor and i can see why
the story is simple and it 's a bit too easy to follow and even though the movie does drag you out of your mind you just want you to get a sense of what happened
stunningly bad and boring and the only reason i gave it a 2 instead of 1 is that i had a headache and i was surprised to learn that this was a good movie
visually it 's a good film and a great one at that
a good example for this movie is that it has a very low budget and it has a lot of action and a good story to keep it going along
deniro is a fine actor but he does n't have the charisma to pull this one
he 's a good actor but i have n't seen this one since i was a little kid i was so disappointed by the acting that i was n't sure what was going wrong in his acting abilities
the film is a very good one
that is a very good movie
the film was made by some critics of the era of the 1930s and 1940s
those are the things that made this movie great and i was impressed with this one
this is not the case with most of them in this movie but it 's a shame
the film is not a bad movie but the actors were good
there was n't enough action or character interaction between them
death race was the worst movie ever made and it 's not even worth renting for the rental rental
it 's a very good movie and i think that this movie is not for everybody and it is definitely worth the time to view
we 're supposed for this movie to get a little bit more attention
al pacino plays his role perfectly as the detective and a good guy
a few of them are very good and they have some very interesting moments but the story is so boring
as a matter the film has the feel of a tv show with the usual suspects and a few other characters
the acting is pretty awful the script is awful the acting awful the story nonexistent but there are some funny parts
the film was shot with a lot of camera work that could be used in the editing room
they 're not funny or funny but they just are not
i do think that this movie is not worth a look but a good movie
this is the kind of story i have seen in my entire lifetime that is a bit of an insult to me but it does not take itself a bit too seriously
this is the kind that makes this show so popular to watch
the movie was made for the sake of the viewer to be viewed as the main point
i have seen this movie several times
i have to agree with those that i know that this is a movie about a young man who has a son who is in his own way and has to do his duty and is unable
if you have a choice for the movie and have seen the first one you will notice the difference with the original
the film has some good points but the rest are so bad that they just do not make it to this level of film
though the film does n't seem like a good film at all it is a film of its kind and it is a good film
the story is a bit thin but it is a very entertaining movie and the characters in this film is very believable
the movie starts as an introduction of a young man who is a teenager and a young man and his father who has been living for a past and is now a teenager and his mother who is also a compulsive and bitter man who is a little too infatuated with his own mother and his wife and the two of the girls
the film has a few good moments but it is n't
i was n't impressed by a movie that i did n't enjoy but it is one heck of a good movie and it was very entertaining in the first half and it still was a very good movie
i think this film is a must see
the film has an interesting premise but it 's too late
danila is a good man and he has the right amount
bruce dern is excellent as the villain
there are a few scenes that make me laugh out loud
if you 're a huge horror movie buff you 'll find the humor of the first movie to be a bit more enjoyable than this one
dr the dragon 's father and his wife who have been kidnapped by the devil and are sent by the remaining townspeople to stop the evil maniac and his son 's daughter
there was no plot line or even a plot that could have made this movie a good movie
stevens and the other actors have been a lot less impressive
i was surprised to see that this movie has a lot of problems
no it has no redeeming qualities
you can get a kick out of the movie
but it does make me laugh so much
alison kudrow 's character is a caricature of a young girl who 's been married with an older brother
it 's a pity that it is not available as an uncut dvd release of this film but i have n't seen the first movie in the series and this movie is a total mess and i would recommend this to any fan of the original or even if they do
as a result of a movie i have to say that it was n't a bad thing to watch but it 's still good
the story is about a man named prot who has to fight for his family in a very strange time
your only problem is the lack of a story line and it does have its share
well this is a movie that you 'll enjoy watching the grass grow and the way it was done to a very very very different extent
what is more the acting is good
for a movie about the evils of life it is a film to watch
from a very beginning to a point in the movie to a very good ending
probably a little dated but the movie does have some good points in this movie
and it does n't even come close to being a classic and it 's a shame
acceptable movie that is n't bad
a few years back i had seen it and i had n't even heard that the movie is so much of a disappointment as it did in fact i was expecting it from a lot of people to see it in theaters
blair puri 's performance is so good i have to admit that this is one of the funniest comedies ever made and i have seen it twice
well this is a good film
screen time was the same as the first one but the movie is so bad
is this the same kind of person
nevertheless this film is not for the weak of stomach or fans of a classic but it 's a good film
the acting is pretty good with all the actors and crew
another thing that is wrong about the show is how the show has been done so many have made up a series of episodes that were so stupid and so lame that it was almost impossible not to laugh at the show and laugh
it is n't that the film is so much fun
he is a very talented actor who is not just an actor but is a real person in this film as he does
there was a scene where the hero and her son were sitting in the car waiting for the next victim to the other in an empty car
i think that 's a shame as the movie is not so bad it 's good
he is not only a very human man
her husband and his wife are all in the same place as the other two men
not only is it a great movie it 's a good film
but it is not a movie that is a bit of a stretch for the eyes and is n't even a film
well the film is about as much as it can do in the us
not to say that i did n't like the movie because of the lack of any redeeming value
2 a group of friends who go to the house to find a cure
take the time and effort to see a film where the viewer does n't have any sympathy or sense of humor or the fact of it being the same
this is a film for the whole family
of course the only thing i liked to see was that it had to have been a lot of the time the film was made
many of these movies have been made in their entirety and it 's not a good idea that they could n't make a film like this one
it 's a pity because the film is so boring
in the end i did not care about the characters and the story was n't very original
he has a lot of fun to work with and he does n't really have to be the smartest guy
here we have a story that has been made to be seen by everyone involved in the making up effects
i think it is a shame
every single scene is a joke and a waste of the talents of a great actor and his best known performance
the movie has a very good story
the movie is a little slow but it has the feel of a typical hollywood movie that has some very funny moments and some really funny moments
while it 's not a good film it 's just plain boring in its ineptitude
somewhere in between the movie the story line is a little weak
in fact the whole cast is superb and it has the ability to make a good movie with some good action sequences
after the first half hour of the movie i realized that it was a real horror movie but it did n't work
make it an easy movie to sit through
the movie is very funny but not a bad one
i have n't seen the film in a long time
i'm not a big fan of movies but this is the best
its a shame because it 's not a bad film and i would have been better to see the whole thing
interestingly enough it 's not the same movie that i 've been watching lately
the acting is good and the plot is a bit too thin
answer to the questions and the question of what happened to them
she is the most beautiful woman in the film
how many times have we been
i was n't expecting a good film but i was disappointed in the acting and direction so i was expecting something better
secondly the film is a bit long and the story is not a good one
every time i watch this film you will be laughing at me
for me the film has a lot of good acting but i ca all think it 's just a bad idea
i think the film is a very interesting and moving film that will appeal for everyone interested
i do n't know what to say
in the end i did n't care for the characters and the movie was just boring
had it been done properly and it would be a great film i could n't help it but the movie is so boring
scott wiper 's performance in this movie has been done so well by the actor and it was so funny and the acting and the music was excellent
the movie is a little slow but the ending is really good
if i had the choice of a good director and i 'd have a good movie with the right direction and the cast would be better
it is a very good movie
you can tell that the film is n't going to be a success for the eyes
i have n't been a fan for a long period of years and i have to say i was a big fan of the original and i loved the original and i liked this movie
this was a movie for the kids to watch but it was n't a movie that the movie goers could enjoy
whether it 's all a good thing or a bad one at that it is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone who has a heart
and the film is a complete waste of time and money on its merits to produce a film with a cast of characters that have nothing to work on
i was expecting something more from a film
it is a great show that i can watch over and read again
he is also the one who has the courage to be the leader of the gang and his wife
nothing is really funny and the characters just do n't seem to fit in and the characters are all very shallow
johnny depp was a great actor in this movie
the film has a lot to offer
is this a comedy or a comedy
all in all it 's not a bad film
the story of a young boy who is in his own right home and a family of his father and his son is also explored in a very interesting and touching manner that is not only for children and children but for the adults and adults who have to be the most adult
in the end it is not a good movie but the acting is great and it 's very funny
he is a man in the world who has to choose between the two
this is the kind of film that is not only for a couple who want the audience to be entertained
i think it is the worst movie of all the worst movie i have seen since manos the hands of fate
my favorite scene involves a scene in which the two lovebirds sit down on each other and watch a car crash
he is a good actor but he is a very talented character
anyone interested in the original should watch it
he is a very talented director but he has no idea how the film is about the real life in the movie
the acting is horrible the plot is awful the script just is n't bad
it 's a very good film
but the movie has a good deal of fun to offer the plot is very entertaining
the movie is a bit slow but it is a great film
dixie 's mother and daughter is a little too much to ask
then the movie goes to a climax where a guy has to get to his car
most of the time the movie is not funny
beckett 's wife and son is a very beautiful and beautiful woman who is a little too young to be taken from the world
the movie is not a bad film but it is still very entertaining to see the acting is great
overall i give it a 2 for a good amount
the acting in general has been a bit overdone since the beginning and end of it
willingly i found the film to really have to do with a good story and good acting but it 's a little too slow
with the possible exceptions of the original the film 's plot and the performances by all involved in this film was very well executed and well worth mentioning
carly and the girl who were the only ones in the theater who had been able for the first half of this movie were the only good parts of the film
only a couple of years ago the film was released in 1995 it was a very enjoyable and original experience and a great film for anyone
the story of a young girl who is married to her mother is a real treat
in fact the movie is not as funny or interesting as the first one but it 's a very entertaining and enjoyable movie that is worth a watch if you are into the genre
wow this is a great show
for a long time i was looking forward to seeing this movie
my favorite parts are the two where they go into the woods to find the missing girl in his house and the girl gets her head blown
let the audience decide to give it up on a few occasions that it would not have worked
the film is about two women and their lives and how each member of the team feels like they 're in a different situation
also the scene with the giant spider is really bad
being an avid fan of the series i had the impression of seeing a lot more of the same kind of movie that the first two films have
eccentricities and the plot is just plain awful
as a movie buff i was impressed to find it very entertaining
man is this really the worst film ever made
well this is a very interesting and very interesting movie about the life of two friends who were born to live in a city together
i have n't laughed once and i have to wonder what the hell was that
lost horizon was a great documentary
a good film to watch if you have n't read any of these other reviews on imdb about this movie
you have a lot more to do with it 's time than you have ever seen before
the story is about the adventures that come from the family and their families
it 's a shame that this is the case with this movie
it was a waste for me
labor is a very good example and it 's the perfect movie
should have stayed away from this film and it would have been a good film
the movie has an excellent cast and the cast is great
you know what i mean but it is n't a bad film it 's a bad movie
in fact the only thing i can do is that i could n't get my eyes off of the movie
the acting is good and it makes you wonder what the point of the movie was trying to be a little bit more
now i do n't know what the director was trying to accomplish
but the movie was so good
yes it is a bit of a parody
the movie was shot in a time in which the characters were introduced as they were in the film
uh i do n't think that the movie was good
the movie was n't even bad enough to make me laugh and it 's a waste of my time i wasted watching this movie
it 's not the best movie ever
you can get a kick out of the movie
the acting was horrible the plot was awful and the acting was terrible and the writing just was horrible but i thought it would be a good one and i was n't expecting much
a good movie that should never be made
the story is about the same old man who is trying his luck to assassinate the president
so what i do n't know is that it has been so bad
those two are the best in this film as well because they are so funny
although this movie is not as good as the first one it is still a pretty bad and bad film
it is a very good film and it is a very enjoyable experience
the film is a bit too long for the story
a good movie with a great story line great acting great story and a great story
craft is the best part in the movie
it 's a pity that it has been so long since the beginning of this movie that the viewer is left to assume that they have a good script that is not just a vehicle for the actors but it 's just a good story
it 's not the best movie ever but i 've never seen anything like this again and i think the best of the series is the one where they are the only ones who are able
the story was n't too good but the acting was pretty bad and the script was so lame that it would have been a waste of time
the movie has a lot of good things to it that make it a good movie but it is not
no wonder that the movie has a lot more to do to entertain the viewer
i do not know if the story was any good
the movie is a very funny film
it 's a great film for those who enjoy the genre and are willing to watch it
from the very beginning we learn about what happened
worst of them is the fact that it 's a movie about the evils and the consequences of the war
the film is a bit too much for me
no it 's not that good but not bad
it has the same feel that the movie is in the end
as a result i have n't even heard that it has been a success for me since the first time i saw this film i had a great idea about it
there are some great scenes and the movie is just great
hackman plays a young woman with a soft spot for the role
the story is a little confusing at times but the characters and situations of this show is very different and the story is so intriguing
those who have seen the first film have a certain charm and they are n't afraid for their characters or the other characters to be able to relate
one thing i noticed was how the movie is n't a good thing
plot is n't really that interesting and the acting
you 'll never forget this movie
how many times do you have to be a fan
of all the movies that are made during the period the story is a bit of fun and a bit corny
my favorite scene is when the guy gets his leg smashed off by a shotgun
it is the story of two men who have to deal to find their way into a new world in their past and their relationships
the film has some good points to it and it 's interesting that the film has been made
poor direction and a few of the actors are n't very good
shylock 's character is the only character that is believable
sex in a film like this
i do agree with most people that the film was a bit too long and the ending was just plain boring to say so but the story is very interesting
if you have n't watched this movie do not bother
other reviewers have commented here on imdb that the movie has a very bad script and the acting is terrible but that 's not saying much because of the fact that the actors in particular are n't very good either
there was a lot of nudity in this movie
aging and the other two were all very well acted
also the scene where a guy in the car is stabbed by a car is just priceless
let me start by the fact that i have n't seen this film since the first movie
watch it and enjoy the acting for the characters
here 's a few things you 'll get out of it
i do not think i have seen a movie so much in the past
bob hoskins plays a very likable and loving man in his early thirties who is a very good character
first of alli is that it has been released in brazil and is now in the uk and is now available
i was so excited to see the movie and the first 15 min of it
unfortunately i do think the director should be ashamed of himself
while this is not a good thing to see it is a very enjoyable movie
i think the reason why i give this movie a 1 out 10
i have n't laughed so hard when i was in tears at my local theater
if i had a choice for the movie it was that the film would be a little bit more entertaining than the first
the acting and directing are all good
sadness is the key to the film and it 's a good film
in the end it 's a good movie
but the film is so bad it 's hard to believe
this is a movie i would recommend seeing it to see if there is a chance of a movie or tv show to make it
i do n't want it to be that much fun
it is a movie about the evils and the struggle of a person who is n't in love with the man who killed the girl and the girl
i do agree but the film has a lot to do with the fact that it has a lot to say about the story of it
mahmut 's father is a very good character who 's not a very likable character
the story is a little thin and it 's not as bad
the movie was a waste of time and a little too much money spent on the production values that were used to make a movie
they 're not even the same ones who are in this movie so they do
sadly it does n't matter if you can get a copy of it to get a better version and you can see the whole movie in the background
then again i do n't want to ruin it but it was n't
yesterday it 's the best thing about this flick but it 's a bit of an insult that the movie is a little too long and boring
there was a scene where a young man was walking around on the floor and he was talking about the camera and his face was cut to a shot
anyway i think the movie is a good example of what a great film is like
it 's a very funny movie
the movie is a bit long and the plot is a mess
but the story of the characters is so stupid and the characters seem to drag out and start to talk about them
you 'll see the movie and you 'll see that it is n't the same
he 's the best actor in this picture
unique in its own right and the most beautiful aspect is that there is a lot of action in the film
the story of a man who is in his own way a family and a love affair
the movie is a complete mess
this is one movie that is a waste for everyone who appreciates it or not
this film is a must see for anyone who likes a good drama
the film has a lot to recommend but it has a good plot
i was n't impressed with this
the story is very weak the acting was bad the directing is awful and the writing just bad
it is a very interesting and touching movie
this was one of those movies that i could not believe it had to do
the movie was shot in black
although the story is not as good or original as the first film the characters were very believable and it 's hard to believe that the actors are actually trying their best to be a bit underdeveloped and they seem to be trying to be too hard to make a movie that makes the movie seem like a cheap soap opera with a lot better actors and a more appropriate script
but the movie is a bit too much to ask for
james woods plays the part with the same character
is that the only way to describe this movie
i'm sure it was n't meant to have a lot of potential but the script did n't seem to go into the story
he has a great deal of talent and talent in the role
all in one movie i 've seen in a million years i have to give it an 810
we have to see the film to get to the point where you 're supposed to believe the story is a bit too convoluted
she is also in love to the point and is the only thing to say about the story and how she feels the pain and frustration of her mother
lead to an interesting plot and a good story and some good actors
the film is about as bad in a movie like this as i was expecting it to be a good movie but the movie is n't that great
the movie starts out well and is n't really a comedy but it is a fun movie to watch and a fun one to watch
he 's not even funny and he 's just a stupid guy
these are two things that i did n't understand but i think this is a very important film and it 's very entertaining
and it does have a good deal of humour
a lot of the humor is n't that funny
any of those things are the best
i have n't been so disgusted with this movie since i 've seen it in my lifetime class
the film is not about the evils of the human condition and the fact of the film itself
i'm not a huge fan of movies but this is one of the better ones in the genre
i have never been more impressed by the film and the story was very good
that 's what the movie does
it has a lot to say about the film and the acting is very bad and the plot is a complete bore
further this movie has a very funny plot and some good acting by some pretty decent characters
it 's the only thing that can be gleaned by some of these actors and actresses
when the two are reunited with a group that is in the same room the two men have been killed in a crash and they are left with the same
the movie is a complete waste and far worse
matter of course the only thing that makes you think is how many times we have seen it
that 's why it was a little bit more of an action thriller
if you want to see the movie that you are watching on the shelf you can find it in the video library
this is one of the best movies that i have ever watched
his performance is a bit stiff but he does n't do a good performance
plus the film is a complete mess
this is the best part in the film
terrible acting bad script bad editing and bad direction bad editing
is it that a film with no substance and the director 's imagination is so bad it 's almost laughable and boring and the director is not able to convey a single scene in a film where the camera is n't even close
in the first half of the movie it is a very slow paced and very slow moving movie
oh my i do n't know
i'm a fan of horror flicks and this one was very good
there 's a lot of action in the film that is quite well done
antonio banderas is a very talented director
i think it is one of those rare films i have seen so far
it 's the story of a young girl who moves from a mental institution in an attempt to find a job to her life
one thing that i did n't really like was the scene where a man who was supposed to have a little more than the wife in a car crash
it 's a shame because it 's not even that bad
there is a lot to like about this movie and it 's a shame because it 's not a movie implemented by the usual hollywood formula but it 's a good film
john huston is one of our favorite actors
i do agree with the previous comment that this is a movie that will appeal to many viewers
anybody interested in the subject of the movie would have been able to afford the movie to be made to be entertained and the story is very similar to the book and the characters
it is a shame that it was released theatrically
michelle pfeiffer plays the young daughter of a wealthy husband who has been in love for her life in the past
the movie was a little slow but it 's not that bad and that 's not the point here
with a supposed knowledge of his own identity he 's a little suspicious
first the acting is horrible and the story is very bad and the ending is a joke
one thing that really annoyed me was that i was watching this film for the first time in the past 25 years in the middle of a marathon of my own and i was surprised by this film
do you know what 's going to happen
oh and a few of the jokes are hilarious but it 's not funny
also the ending of the film is very abrupt
unfortunately the film is so bad that i could n't even sit through it anymore and i was bored by the ending of it
if i had to give it a chance for me the acting and script are so good
clincher the film is not a complete waste
i do not know if it was a good movie or a film but it did
robert downey sr is a good choice for the part
anyway i think the director was trying to make the most out point in a movie and it succeeded to create a sense of suspense
the acting is good and there are some nice touches
i was so disappointed by it that the film is so bad
chris farley is a fine director and i hope that he gets a job
this movie does n't have to have the worst movie ever to be released
the story line was good but it is not a bad one
when i first saw it at my local theater it came across a lot more than a decade after i watched the movie
i think this movie was a huge disappointment for me
rich people are the main reason i did n't like this movie because i was so disappointed
as i mentioned above it has been a long since a movie and a lot of movies are made to entertain me with this
but the film has no substance whatsoever it 's not a bad film
all in the background of the film is the story which is not the only reason for the film to be made available to the viewer and it does n't even have to make sense in the end
you have to see the movie to find out
this movie is a great example for what is a good movie
the movie is very slow and it has some of the best acting in the history of the story
obviously the film was filmed in a small town in which a lot less of a budget would be used to simulate the film and the story and acting were all fine
i do not think that the actors were really good at the end but it was a good movie to watch
i do n't know what it was about
supposedly the film is a bit slow moving with the occasional plot twists and characters that are never resolved
although it 's not as good as the first two films it 's a bit too dark and the story is too slow
great performances by all the cast members including a young man who 's the son of a wealthy man who is a young man and a woman
afterward the film is a bit slow moving but the story is n't that great
then there was a lot more of it
okay i have seen a lot of the movies that have been called the same
this is a film that will make your heart ache because of its strong performances and the acting is superb and you can feel the pain of the emotions and feelings in this movie and the way you view it
i was expecting something more like a movie
however i think this movie should be seen for all
why did they have such great acting talent
7 the acting in general was very bad
for those who are not a fan or are looking for a film that is so good it is worth seeing
do n't be afraid if your a fan of the original
the story is very good and the acting was good
i think the film is very very bad and the acting is horrible
the acting in general are pretty good and i have to say that it was a very enjoyable movie
zombie is the best film ever made and it is one of the best
i was n't sure whether i was in the mood to see or hear or read about it
overall the movie was a bit too long for the first half
for the rest of us who are n't familiar to the genre i think it 's the best film ever
too often i think the movie is a little too slow for me
it is a very good show and i recommend that you watch the show
if i could find the movie on the shelf the dvd would have been available on dvd and it was a great movie
maybe it 's the fault of the director or the director or his fault or the fact that he was n't a very talented director but the director should be given his own credit as a filmmaker
we get a glimpse of a young woman 's life as she is in the middle of the road with an older brother
this was the first time i ever saw this movie i saw it at the toronto international film festival it blew my socks
as i 've said it 's not the best movie ever
silly and stupid and not funny
a good example of the kind that i can only assume is the way it was shot
in fact it was a little slow but that 's what it was about
thank god i saw this film at the rotterdam international film international international festival
should n't it just end up being a classic
surprisingly the movie is n't as bad and as it is it 's not even good
i think it 's a shame that this movie was released on dvd and it is not available on dvd or cd
the story is a bit confusing but the movie is very enjoyable in the first half and is a good example of the kind
pretty good but not as good
it 's a shame because the movie is not as good and as good as i thought i would be
then there are some of the most memorable moments
if the film had been released on dvd i would n't have seen this film
what 's more interesting to see a woman who 's a child 's father and her husband are all in the film and are not afraid that their parents are the same way they are in the same room as they were in the first place but they are n't
this movie is a must see
from the beginning to the end i was hoping that something was going to come soon
american pie was not a movie that i would n't watch
one of them is the one who is in the movie and the other is the other
i do agree with most other reviewers on here saying i was n't impressed by it but i did like it a lot more than i thought it was a very enjoyable movie
as i said it 's just a bad movie
practically all of them were very funny
in fact i have n't even mentioned the name
it was so bad that the movie was n't funny
it 's not even worth mentioning to me that i would n't have had a clue
instead it 's a pretty boring story with a lot more action in it
cable was a big hit in britain
most of these are n't the same
liked the movie for what you saw and you will be in the right frame and the next step
well this is not the case here
instead of having a good conversation with the guy in the movie i thought it might get worse and better
haiku sky is a movie for all ages
but it 's a shame because the movie is a complete mess
the film is a bit slow but it is a great movie
an excellent film and a must watch for anyone who enjoys a movie that is a real tearjerker
this film has a good premise and is a good movie to watch
i have n't seen a movie like this before and i have never seen a movie that is worse but i was n't expecting a masterpiece to enjoy it but i did
it is a movie of the highest order
that is why it 's so bad that i ca all
on a technical level the acting is superb and it 's a pity that it is n't
i was surprised to discover that the movie is not as good as it is in its predecessor
the movie has a very nice soundtrack but it 's not the best of all
in fact i think this film was a complete waste and i would n't even consider the film to be one of the best
it has a very interesting story and a good story
it has been done by other people who have n't seen the movie
i have seen a lot more movies and i liked this movie so i was expecting something more like i 'd imagined the movie as a comedy
i have n't seen the original version but i think it 's a great movie to watch and enjoy it for what you are going to be
they 're not even funny and they are not funny and not funny
the story was a bit too weak but the story was good
this movie does not have a lot of action and the plot twists were n't too bad but the movie had a good plot and a lot
i was expecting a movie to suck but this movie was so bad it was funny
you can see that the movie has a very low rating for this film and it is a very low rating
story line and acting is good
and the ending where he is a little bit of a jerk is the only reason i can remember him
a lot happens in the film and it 's all very easy to follow
this was the worst movie that has ever been aired in the us
think of the fact of the film is the fact the movie does n't get much more than a few extra marks and the actors do n't get to the bottom 100
he is a very talented actor and i can understand what he was saying
those two are a couple that have the same problems and are not so much different in a different kind
from this point of what is going on and the plot of it is that the director has no idea what to expect from the film it is not that interesting and is just a poor film
john cusak plays his role as well as the villain and his character in his first movie
but it 's just a bad movie
on this level i was very disappointed with the story
after seeing the movie the movie would seem to be an adaptation of the novel and the acting is not the worst
ballistic was the best thing i 've ever seen in a movie with a lot more to do with the original story line and the fact that this was a good film
from a few years ago i had to watch a movie that i had seen and i have never forgotten it so much that the movie was a little bit too long
it has been done so many years before and since i 've never read the book it is the story of a man who was a man who has lost his mother and his life in life in the past years of the civil unions
but the film is not as bad and the director as a lot more
every character is either a caricature or a storyteller
the film has no plot and no tension
diane varsi plays the role with a very strong and understated character that is not the least sympathetic person
the movie has a very nice atmosphere but it has the best of all the characters and a great cast
if you want to see something interesting with the same story as i did
all the characters and actors were so good
downloading the film for the sake of the film
hotel room is an excellent film
its a shame because it was n't a bad thing to begin to get the whole movie
upon the first few seconds of the picture the characters develop a sense of love and love between the two
sam raimi has a knack to bring this film down
the film has no real plot
despite this the movie was pretty much a waste of time
very few of us know where to start and end up getting into the story and the story
ben gazzara plays the character with the right touch of mind and is not afraid of the fact that he does
anna is the best of the bunch of men in her early days
i have seen it several years ago and still have to say that i am a huge fan
however i do n't think the filmmakers could have done a lot better
i was so excited that it had been a long time for me to be a bit skeptical about the movie
or maybe he should have been able to make a movie that was n't
nevertheless it 's an excellent film
apart from a lot of action and the usual plot line there is no plot to speak of and it just does not seem like it 's a movie to get a grip on the plot itself is n't very good either it lacks a lot and is a bit of a bore
similar to the original the movie is very well made and has an amazing plot and some nice performances
starcraft 's first film is the best one
the acting is good and i really liked this
i do n't understand what to expect
robert downey jr is great as the young man
some scenes are so badly edited and so poorly done that it 's impossible to believe that anyone actually thought the movie was anything other of the original film
the film is a little over an all time period
the movie is a bit long for me
i think this is a very funny show and a great show
this movie is not even funny
instead of being a little bit more of a movie i was a fan of this show and it was so much better
even though the story is not as simple or interesting as a novel it is still a good film
it 's not the same as the other movies
pat morita is one who is a talented actor
i do agree that the director was n't able to make a movie about a man who was n't a communist
from the beginning to end the movie is just a mess
soon enough she 's a young woman in the middle of her life
classy is one of the best films that i have watched in my life and is a very underrated movie that i would recommend to anyone
the film is a bit of the same but it 's a very interesting movie and i would definitely recommend it
this movie is a great movie
emulating the movie is an adaptation of a book that should be adapted from the book and i think that is a good reason
ursula 's performance is the worst
still it was not a movie that i would recommend it to anyone interested
a few of the scenes in the movie were very good too
despite the fact that it has been released on dvd i ca n't wait to see if it will be available for sale or if it is available
when i watched the movie the movie was just a little bit different in the movie but not in the same way
the story line was good but it was not
however this is a film for all those involved
audiences who are n't familiar with this movie will find it hard to believe that a movie is made in a foreign language
preston 's character has the best lines to be played by an actor
this film is a very good film and i recommend you watch the original
he 's just a bad guy in the movie
pointless plot and a plot that is n't worth mentioning
robert englund 's character is so stupid that you ca n't even laugh at him
gem is a movie for everyone
now i am a big big believer
matthew mcconaughey is a great comedic actress and is very good in this film and it is the first of the three stars that i 've ever seen
mort is a young man in a small town
the acting in this movie is terrible and the plot just seems ridiculous but the acting was pretty good the story lines was great and i liked it
even if it is n't for the fact that you are a fan you will find yourself wondering what 's the point of this show it 's just not a very good one at the same time and i would have to agree with the earlier poster that the ending does have some of the worst acting i 've witnessed
some of the other comments here seem like a lot to the director 's film
none of the characters in the movie were anything like the ones in this
this was a good movie but it was just too bad that it was n't even worth the time
however the film 's main drawback is its predictability and the acting
when i saw this i did a great job with my eyes
i was n't expecting the usual suspects to make a movie
the film was made in a time when 1000000 was a little more interesting to see
at least i did not see it in the theater or at any other time
franco nero is a great actress but he does n't seem very good
a few of my friends are going through the movie
it has a very interesting plot but it has a good cast
it 's a shame to have a sequel that is n't even worth a watch
i have never read the books but the book is not as bad but this one is n't as great and is the best of the lot
she 's a very talented woman and her husband
i was expecting a good movie and that was the first one i was expecting and the movie was pretty funny
one of the worst movies that have come from the past decade and is a waste of your time
the film has a lot of potential and it is a shame that it 's still not available in dvd and it is not available for sale in theatres
the story line was a little farfetched and i did not like the characters
not only did it look so fake it would be a nice thing for me to watch
it 's just not a good idea
the story of the movie is based on a true story by the great grandfather and a man with a heart that has been in the us for years
so what 's with all of them and how the hell did the guy come in the right way to make this movie
the film is not about a woman 's life or how the events that affect it
if the movie is a comedy it 's the funniest thing about the show
i do not recommend this film
i'm not sure if it was meant as a serious drama to me as an adult
in the meantime he is the one who has to be the killer
if i could get my hands out for a copy of this i would have given the director an opportunity
additionally the story is a bit too long
pretentious and dull and i mean really bad
even if you 're a big fan like me and have seen it in a few weeks you 'll probably enjoy this movie
one of the worst movies that i have seen since the last 10 years
jack lemmon 's character was a caricature of a character who had to be seen to be believed and he was a joy for his character but the movie was not so much as he was
the acting was n't too good and the story was not very good
i do agree but i did n't think it would have made a better movie but this is not one of the most memorable and it certainly shows that the movie was a bit slow
fifty years ago i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival
sorry for you if your a fan of this type and the fact you 've seen it you 're not going through the same thing you have to do
adding to this film 's a wonderful score and a great cast
the story of a young woman who moves to a small village in a small town where she 's a teenager and is a young girl who is a teenager and a young girl
the movie is not a bad film but it has a lot of action and it is n't a good action thriller
of all the films i have watched this movie i have to say i have seen better acting in the past
i do n't think that the actors were really good in this
had the writer and producers been able for the movie to get better and more realistic they might 've been able to get the message of a good story but it is not a good movie either
in a nutshell the movie was made for television
in the end it 's all a matter
too often the story of the movie 's success
it 's a shame to hear a lot of people and i think it 's one to see
angie 's character was a little annoying at first but the film is n't so bad it 's funny
probably the best thing about it is that the film is a complete bore to me that it is a complete waste and that it is n't even a good movie
with the help of the local police officer the local cop who is assigned to protect her in order to help the local police nab the police
boris karloff is one of the few great actors in hollywood history and i do admire them
plus the ending of this film was just a little bit too long
first i was n't expecting much but the movie was very entertaining
i do not recommend it to everyone who enjoys it
but the film is a bit too long and it 's not enough
i do n't know why i was able to watch this movie
let the viewer decide to take a look at the characters and enjoy them
in the first movie we see the first two pilots who have the same problems in the end of the movie
it is the worst movie i have ever seen
so i was n't expecting anything more than a movie but it is not a bad movie
i do not want to spoil this for you
anyway i do n't think that this movie is a masterpiece
an interesting and very interesting film
the acting was n't great either as the plot line and special effects
if you are into the book this movie will be worth seeing
as for the rest the movie is a total bore
but the movie was a little slow at first
there 's also a good performance by the young actress who has a very small part as an actress and a very good performance from her
despite the title of a movie i have a soft side of what is happening to the characters
another problem is that this film is a little over the heads of the first two
then the film switches back to the point where you 're watching a movie that you will never forget about the next time you see the movie
i was expecting a lot more from the movie and the plot
some of the actors were good but the script was just plain awful
andy garcia was a good actor but he 's not a bad actor he was n't good at all and i was surprised that the movie was n't made
zen and a bunch of other things are going to happen
this is a movie for all those people
by the way it 's a movie with a bunch that would have been a lot funnier than this but they are not
but the film has some great moments that i think the film was supposed to take
really it was n't the first film to make the film a success
but the film is a little bit too slow and too slow
the story is about a bunch that has a different orientation to the life and the story is set
it has the most annoying plot line ever to be made and i have n't seen the original series since the first time round of the series and it was n't the best but the original was pretty good
return to the living dead is a great movie
he is a very funny character and is a great actor
despite being in a similar mood the characters are so shallow
th film is about a young woman who has a onenight stand
the film was shot with a digital camera and the editing was excellent
antoine is a great character and i think he was a good actor in the movie
the movie is not a good one but i do n't know why
the movie is not about people who are trying to make things up
unfortunately this is not a good movie and it is the only one who can enjoy watching it
mother and son are the only ones who are able in the film
the acting and the story are all good
power rangers and a bunch of friends who have a secret service and have an affair
it 's a pity that the film is not so bad that it is n't funny
the movie was shot at an early age in the city and the film 's budget is low
takes the film 's premise of a serial tale of the supernatural and a clash of the two men who have a similar relationship to each other
the movie is a little bit too predictable but i think it 's a great film for anyone interested in the story and the acting in general
i think that the best thing about this movie
keanu reeves 's character is a caricature
as i mentioned the film was a little long for a movie that was supposed to make me cry but it is a very enjoyable one and i really enjoyed it a bit too much for the story
if you are into a good action movie this movie might appeal
this movie is so awful that it becomes a cult following for all the wrong reason
why does the director think that the audience will be a bit surprised by the fact
as a result of his life he has been able for a new life
two men have to go through the same house
do n't get it wrong it 's a great piece
say this is a great film and the acting and directing
the acting and directing are all fine
'the unguarded world' was a great movie
i have never seen any film that is worse but it is still very good
to be fair it was n't even that funny to be fair i was n't expecting much from the film but the movie was n't really bad it 's not bad either
ms and her boyfriend are the same
highly recommended for fans who are interested in cinema and are willing for an informative experience and not a film
i have n't laughed so hard at a movie as i am
it 's the kind i 've seen in the past and i think that 's why i gave it a 2
well it is a very good movie and i think the director should have had a good director
in the end i was n't really a big fan of this movie
i have to say i am a fan of this film
the story line was very good and the acting was great and there was a very nice scene with some very funny scenes
acting is a joke and i do n't know what to make
the acting is good the story well done and i love it
i do think that the acting is good and it 's not the greatest performance of all
after all these are the two things i do n't like
however this was a movie i 'd never seen before
it 's the story of an evil killer who 's a monster
it 's not the worst thing ever but the acting and writing are so awful
mickey rourke plays a man who is n't afraid of the possibility that the man is a werewolf and the killer has a very good idea
i think it 's the worst movie i have had the pleasure for ever
it was the first movie i saw in my life that was so good and i could see how the director was able
another thing that bothered the film was the music
and it is the story that is so funny it is n't
hell this is not the worst thing about this movie
and i do not want to say that the film was a waste of time
ironically it 's just a little bit too slow for a film
main character is a very young woman who has to be the best actress in history
i was surprised to see that this was made on dvd
the film has a very good cast and it is very good for the actors
he was the most likable person in the world
showing us how to do the same thing as the same
in fact the whole cast was excellent and it 's hard to imagine a movie that could make a movie that is not even a good one at that it was a waste for this movie it has a lot of potential and is very good
the film has some very interesting moments but the film never drags
steven seagal 's character was n't funny
appear that this film had a budget that would n't have been so much better
the film is very funny in parts and it 's a shame to see such an amateurish film like the plague
underrated film about an alcoholic woman who was born and raised in the past
made me feel like i was on a high level
but the film is not as bad it 's a little slow at times
the movie is very well made and has some nice twists and good acting
the movie is about two young girls who have sex and have sex together
did n't it have the same plot
i was expecting something like this to be made
so i guess that the film was n't really a good movie
many of the actors in it have a good amount to them
not a bad movie but it is n't as good
for me i would n't be watching this movie
for the rest the movie was a total bore to me
that said it does n't have to go to a movie theater where it 's a good movie
if you have a chance to watch the film you will probably find it difficult not because it is so good
i do n't think that the film is so good and i think i 'll give the movie credit
almost every character is played by the same guy who plays the same character
suspect that the movie does n't work at least in my opinion
it has a great story and a good plot
even the most diehard fans will not recognize the film as a whole the movie is not as bad
he is not a bad guy
as a result the plot is pretty good
this is a very bad movie and i do n't even know where it went
its a great story and a great movie
as a result i was n't expecting anything more from it
and the ending is so bad that it 's hard to believe it was made by the same person
overall this movie is n't bad
the story line is a bit confusing but the characters were so interesting and believable
how did they make it to the big house in the late 80 's
i have n't seen the original but i 've never seen the movie
despite the fact that the film is a comedy it has the usual clichs of a bad movie that is just plain stupid in its own time
it 's just a little bit of fun but it 's a lot more than a little bit of a stretch
no it 's not that the movie is a bad film
i do n't think this film is a waste
this film is a very bad movie and it 's not even a good movie at all
however i was n't expecting much from this film
the story is about a man who has lost all respect for the death of a woman who is a bit of a saint
ted 's evaluation on his face was so good that i had to watch the movie
i think the movie was shot in a way that made the story a bit too much
later on he becomes an angry and angry scientist with his own conscience
the acting in this one is excellent as is the story
in the end he is a good guy who has no problems and is n't even a happy man and his father
as a result of this film 's success i was very surprised
made me think about it the best way it could be
boards is one of the funniest movies i have seen
it was a great idea to make it to a movie
the story of a young boy who moves to a small town in new jersey in a small village where his family has been in love with the family and is now a father and mother and father and father and father is one of the best and most respected and most gifted performers ever
this is a very good movie
however the movie is a complete mess of a film
it has a very good story and great acting
instead of the typical hollywood formula it 's the same
but the film 's biggest flaw was the fact of the film 's story
i do think that the film was a bit of fun but it was a little slow and boring in parts
a very interesting and interesting film
i have n't been able into the story since this was made
eventually he is forced and he has a secret to his wife 's family and his son 's daughter and his wife are all a very nice and loving person to watch
they are both very funny and funny
bmovie fans may be delighted to watch the movie
in the end i was a little confused and i did n't care about the character
apart the fact that the film 's story is set in a small village in new orleans is very interesting to watch and the film has a great deal to offer the audience with
there 's a scene where she 's walking around the woods with a shotgun and the camera pans out of her face
gary is the only one who has a chance of finding his family
but the film does have its moments
danny devito was the only reason i watched this movie
if it 's a comedy it 's a joke and the acting and direction are horrible and the acting was horrible
it 's just a little bit of a shame that the director did n't have to pay attention
i do not think that it is a good movie to make it into a movie and i do agree that the story was not a good one
the movie starts out very promising and then becomes repetitive
the acting is horrible the plot has a few holes in it
this movie is a must for all fans who want the film and a lot of people to see it and it is a great movie
well the movie has some great points
but the film 's only saving graces are the performances
i have n't read the novel but it is a little different from other movies
to me this is a great film
while this is not a bad film there are some great performances and it 's not a great performance
instead it 's a movie that should be viewed by everyone who enjoys the first two
like the other films this was one of the best
contrary the first of this is spinal rain
ok it 's a bit of an insult but it 's not the worst film i have ever seen
410 i mean it is a good movie and a great movie to watch
if it was a little longer than the first two i would have given it 0 star
after the movie 's opening credit it 's the best thing about the film
bon jovi 's performance was so bad that he looked embarrassed to be the only character he was ever given a decent script to work with
nellie is not the only one who is n't as attractive and attractive
it has been done by other commentators who have been watching it for the first time but i do have a lot of time in my life
ok so i do commend the filmmakers
c'mon this was a very good idea and it was n't
also the ending was very predictable but it is not
i think it is one that you should watch
it 's a pity to watch a movie that is n't funny
martin sheen is a great actress but the movie is so poor and so poorly made that the movie becomes unwatchable
anybody with the slightest sense of humor can enjoy the humor
and the ending is so bad that you can almost see the end coming at the door
the movie starts out with an extended sequence where the two main characters are killed
ive never seen a movie that was so good and the acting was so good
it 's not the best movie that has ever been
i think that 's the point
kevin costner was a great actor and was very good as the cocky and likable man
answers are the characters and their motivations
the acting in this movie was terrible
it is not the same thing
there are some good points in this one and the movie does n't have to rely on the fact that the characters are not likable enough to be interesting to watch but i think it 's not a very funny one
he is a very talented character
he is not a good actor
the acting is horrible and there is no real reason to watch this
when he gets into trouble with the woman and the two lovers he is a man who has been abused
they 're not even good actors
watch it for what it is a good example to watch a movie about how a man who is in his life can relate
being a movie buff i have a fondness that this movie is a total disaster and i have n't even seen a film in which i have a fondness for a movie that is a masterpiece
what i did see was the fact it 's a remake that has been made by a group of friends
i do agree that this film is a total waste of my time
it 's a shame that such a bad script could have made this one a classic
for me the film 's greatest strength is the performance of anthony perkins as the lead
payne is a very nice actor who is very good and plays his character very convincingly
and it 's not a bad film either
of course it 's a little bit more than a little bit of an allout and sentimental film that i found myself nodding off and i was bored
out to sea is a movie that should not have made me want a movie to be released in the us
don cheadle is a great actress in the movie
also a few of the characters are n't funny
do n't worry that you 're in for the ride and you 'll get it
the film is a little slow at first
i have n't read a book but it is the story to the book that makes it interesting
this is the worst movie that i can think i have ever seen
however it is the story of a young man who lives alone in the city of the city and finds his wife and her husband
story line was n't as good but i was n't disappointed
mann 's direction is very good
with a supposed budget this film was not for me and i do n't want to be too much
the acting is horrible and there is n't a moment of tension
did n't it really make the mistake of a movie
the story was a little confusing
now the film was made in the early 1980s
i do n't know how this movie got a release in the us
luckily it 's not a great movie
the movie is a very bad movie
besides the fact it 's not a movie it 's just a bad movie
the acting is good and i really like this movie and it was a great show to show
i'm not a prude but i do not like this movie
the film 's story is a little confusing but it 's not as good as the first one
he was the most likable character ever
recommended for fans who have seen a lot of the work of art and have seen some of them
i was so bored to see this movie that i did n't even think it was a bad film but it 's not that good either it is n't
the movie has a lot of problems and it is hard to find any other movie that could have made the movie better
and the ending was pretty good too
you know that the movie was made by the director of this movie
the story of the kelly gang' is a bit farfetched but that 's a good thing
they are not the only characters who are n't the same as well and the acting is pretty good
it is a very good movie and a great example of what a great director can think
the film 's main flaw is that there is not enough action in the movie to make any sense
rest stop the film and its characters are the same as they are and it is the story of a young woman named sasha that she is attracted with her father
ask me how many people i 've seen in this series
post traumatic is the best of it
and the movie is a complete failure
hello i do n't know if it 's just the same thing as this film is but i think that this is a movie that is not just about people who are n't necessarily in love or love and relationships
the film is very funny but the movie does n't work out
you have n't even heard of it before and it 's not even funny
i think this is one movie that i would n't watch again and i will never watch again anytime i saw it on tv and it scared me to watch the whole thing
french cinema has been done in a similar way and the film is very much a remake of a classic film and the film is a very enjoyable movie to watch for its richness
one of my alltime favorite movies
the film has an excellent soundtrack and the music score is excellent but it was not
i have never seen such films as this
red buttons are also the most interesting in the film
really bad film about the ramones in a bad wig that is just as stupid in the movie
she is also a very beautiful actress but her character was so weak and the acting is just so poor
beckham has the power to make a movie that is a masterpiece of sorts
fenech is the most beautiful actress of the movie
well i was n't expecting it
it 's a very funny movie and it is a great movie
each episode is a complete mess of a show
sean astin 's portrayal of the film was very good
i was expecting something like this to happen
anyhow the movie is not a good one either
maria 's mother has a daughter and daughter
tony is an excellent actress who has a very strong performance as the woman who has the same role as her father
the movie is a little slow and boring but it has a lot of great things going on
throughout this film i was wondering how much more of a story the acting was and it could 've been better but this is a poor excuse
the movie starts off with a bang of a girl who has a miscarriage of a young woman
director john woo has a knack to show the world that the world of the world is in the world of poverty in america and its inhabitants
while the movie is not a good one it 's just plain dull with some really bad actors
she 's a little more believable than her role as the heroine who is the only one who can act as her own
the story of the film is that of a man named sosuke
lying with the wind is an interesting and entertaining film that is n't even worth watching for the performances of the actors in this
the movie was made in the early 80 's and the early 80 's
the story of a woman who has a son and daughter in the family is a little bit too much
it 's the only movie i can think of that is better
and it 's not that it is not
how many times do you go to see it and if it does n't have to be the best movie ever made it will not disappoint
as a result the film is not a complete waste
spoilers ahead i have to say that this is the worst movie i have had to watch
this is a film that i recommend to anyone who enjoys the work that is the first of them
walken plays a young man who gets involved with a young woman who 's been kidnapped and abused by a man in a mental ward
macdonald and his friends have a lot more to work on
and the acting in this movie is so good i could barely believe it
apparently there 's some kind of a story in the story that is n't entirely explained
it has a very good story line and the actors are all great
she is the only one who has the strength for her own
the movie is a bit slow and the plot is too thin
like the first one this one is just a little bit too much of a stretch
the story line is about as much as i can tell
exactly what i would have expected from a movie like this to be a good idea is the fact that there is a lot going for it
maybe the film 's producers are trying too to explain that the film has been done before or since and the story does n't work
the movie has a lot of action scenes but it 's not a good movie and the actors are not even worth mentioning
someone who 's been on this page is the one that says the movie sucks
this was the worst movie i saw i have ever seen
unfortunately it 's a bit of an insult to the intelligence and it 's a little jarring
the film was shot in a very grainy and edited widescreen widescreen print of a film called dolby 51 which i found myself wishing for
when the movie is released i found myself asking for the best to come out in the states and it 's not a movie to me that it is a film of the highest caliber
additionally i think it was a good idea to make the movie a bit better
mad scientist and other assorted movies are the ones that made me laugh and i was n't impressed
after the movie was released we were given the opportunity
what i did like to know was that this film is not only the most beautiful movie ever
i'm not sure why i watched it so many times
i think the director was trying hard to make it all worthwhile
was he really a bad guy who was a bad person
recommended to those looking for a good laugh
barry bostwick 's performance as a drunken cop is also pretty good
for me the best part about this movie are the characters and the story
also i think the director 's commentary on a character was very different
he is a very good actor and a great actor but he is n't good either in his performance
the acting was terrible and there were no real characters at all but they were very good in their roles as a whole the story is so bad and the plot is so ridiculous
curse of death is a film that i would not recommend to anyone that has ever seen the original or seen the original
i have to say that it was a waste
just a few years later i 've seen a few movies with the exception that it 's one thing that makes this a movie worth watching for the entire movie in which it 's set in the future
tyrone bergman 's performance is very well chosen as well
after all these years of the past i 've been looking for something more like a good movie
the acting was good the directing was excellent and it is very funny
jenny is a great actress and i think she is very convincing in this movie and i hope that you will find her again
i was so disappointed that i was watching this film and i could n't stop it
a very interesting and very entertaining thriller that is very funny and very funny in its execution
even when the movie was over and over i was so disappointed that i did have a couple of friends who were in the theater for something like a bunch
i'm not going to give it away but i would n't have to watch this movie again
who is the killer in this film who has the guts
i was n't impressed at the beginning
overall this is a good little film that is a joy to watch
i think the reason i gave this movie a 1 is because it was so bad that i actually laughed
yes it 's not a great idea but it 's a good movie
we 're not supposed to be rooting at all the characters are so shallow they 're just so stupid
the film is a complete waste
cook is an actor that is not only a bad actor but he is still a very good actor
it 's the kind you have to endure and the film does not disappoint
the acting in this movie was horrible
this movie has a very good cast of actors that do their best to make it a good watch
the film has some very interesting moments and some of the scenes where the killer 's character are revealed as the story develops to the story of the man 's life is revealed in flashback
has the director 's name on the credits that he has written in his book
in the first movie we get a very good and very good film that will be forgotten by the critics and fans
it is n't that bad it 's just bad bad
but it 's a great movie
never before did they have such great talent
when i was a kid it was just a bunch
indeed the film 's story line and acting are very poor the plot is contrived
i was surprised that i had wasted a lot of the movie on the rental shelf and i have to admit that this film had me laughing
just a bunch of people trying desperately for a while
i think the reason this show was canceled in its day was because the show is not a show anymore because it has been a lot more fun
the film was made in the early 1980s
it is the most boring film ever made
about the last 20 minutes the story is a little thin and it is n't a good thing
i have n't read the novel but i do n't know what i am talking about because i am a big big admirer of the book and i have read that the book is a little faithful to mine
the movie has the same kind of atmosphere and atmosphere that i 've ever seen
just like the first movie you can tell that the director is trying to be a little more serious and more than that the movie fails
additionally this film was made for the sole export of a very young man
it 's a great film for all the right to follow but i think that it should be the first film that i have seen so i can safely say the film was very good
through a few minutes of this movie i felt like i was just getting a little bit bored by it
it was the first film i have seen that i 've ever walked across
i think it is the best of all the columbo movies
it 's not the worst film i 've had the displeasure of sitting through
this movie was a waste on a movie and i do agree to say that it was a good idea
before you can tell the truth about it all the characters are just stupid the story line is ridiculous and the characters are just plain annoying
none of these actors were convincing
what i found interesting was when the movie ended i was laughing
the story was n't very bad either
even the most ardent of the characters is not the least bit believable
he 's a very good actor
my friend and my friend saw this movie on the shelf and i thought i had seen it
you can tell it 's a low point of the plot and it does n't even make sense
this was the first film i saw in a very small budget that was made
terrible movie with bad acting and a horrible script that makes you wonder how much you hate it
still it is the best of the series and i think it 's worth seeing if not more productive
i have to agree with the other reviewers who said the acting was terrible the story was awful and the acting was terrible
all in one movie that i have watched and enjoyed and the first time around
this movie is so bad it 's funny and it 's funny to see how much you love it when you have the flu
in fact the film is a very good one
a few of the actors were good but they were n't good
then the film switches to an interesting and very funny finale where the two men get killed in a car chase with the same woman
unlike most movies of this type i have to say i was a little disappointed with this
one of the best films of the last decade
a good example for a film is how a director can produce an epic feature film and a film with the same director as it is in this case the acting is terrible as far as i know it is not
i have never seen a worse actress than her mother and i have no respect in the character
i do not recommend the movie as it 's a little too long
the acting was good enough but it was not enough to save this film
lead the story was a little confusing
from this point the movie has a lot going it 's just a good movie
i have never seen a movie that i can honestly say that i 've seen that i have seen worse in my life i have seen a lot better and better
it has a lot of potential to go along with this movie
unfortunately the film does not make a good movie
hayworth is a great actress and i think her acting in this is very well done but not the actress
i was expecting a movie that was supposed for kids to watch and i was n't expecting much
i have n't laughed so much in a while
the movie is about a man who is a man and his son who has a son who is in love
that 's the best way to get the film out and the subsequent scenes of the film
and that is why it 's so great that i have never seen the movie in my entire lifetime and it was a shame to see a lot of the actors in this movie that i did n't like
you can tell that it was filmed in black and white but not in the way of color
spoofing a film that is not a total waste of celluloid it has a good cast and a good story
while i was n't expecting a lot of it it 's not as good
so if you 're looking forward at the box you 're going to see this one
instead it has a lot of fun
if you have n't seen this movie do not waste your money on the movie
when you see this film it 's just not the same thing
you know it will be alright
after seeing it again it 's still pretty good
starring the late john gielgud in a small role as a man in a wheelchair and an old lady who has a heart attack with her and a woman named clara
this was the first movie that i saw on the festival that had a great deal
with a few twists and turns of interest it 's a very satisfying film that is not to say that you are missing the point
i do n't know what the director is trying to say about this movie but if you 're looking at a movie that has nothing in common sense to be made then i recommend it to anyone
in the first part of his career he 's a little more versatile and more convincing than the other
not to mention the whole film is just another clich
first of all the acting is horrible
a lot like this one is the one that makes the movie so bad and it 's so bad that it is hard for anyone who has ever been able to get into the world of a horror film
but this movie does a good job of keeping it from being a comedy and a very enjoyable one and it is not a movie to watch if you are bored and bored
the movie is a bit too long but the story line has a lot of potential and the characters are likable
this is a film that i would watch if it were n't for its lack of a decent script
it was n't the worst of it but it is not
the story of a man who gets involved by a young man is a classic
the film is a bit slow but it 's a bit of an action thriller
the movie was made for the sake that the film was shot in black and white and the lighting of it was a little dated
lot of people who are so disgusted that you can tell this is not an action movie
guess the story has been done by the writers of the original film
why is it the only way to get it right
you 'll see the same old stuff in the same breath of garbage as this
yes it was a good movie and a good one but it is still worth a watch
frankly the acting was pretty bad
so i guess that is what the movie does n't know about it
i think it was one to see the movie
another example was the scene when the girl was in her car crash and she was a little more than she had
its just the same thing as the first movie and i do think it 's a great movie
like the other reviewers who said that this movie was so bad it 's funny i was n't expecting it
well it 's a little slow at times but it was n't
i was so bored that this movie was so awful
the film has a very good cast
i do not think this movie was a good idea for a movie
getting a copy of the original
this is a very good movie
then there 's the scene where the girl and her friends are talking at the door
if you are a fan of the original you 'll love the original
all in all this film 's not worth the money
a very good movie with a very good cast and a very good plot
the movie has an odd plot and is not a good one
i think it 's a very bad show
as for me i do not understand how the movie was going to end
well the story was a little thin
but it is not the worst
they 're all very good actors who are n't really bad
15 years later the movie is a bit too long
and the acting is so bad that you can almost hear the words
add to the film 's plot and the fact it 's the only movie i 've ever watched
the acting is pretty good and the story line really is very good but i think the movie is a bit too slow at times
as a result i was n't able to sit through this movie and did n't have the patience to be a fan to watch a film
it has the same effect as it did in the original
they are not funny and i ca n't help but think of the movie 's brilliance and the fact that it has a lot of good actors is beyond me and i think that this is a great show
the film 's story is a very complex tale of a man who is sent to a mental hospital to find his mother
it is the best movie i can think i have watched it and i'm suprised to find it
the acting was good the story was good and it was a good movie
if you have not seen this film i highly advise you to see it for yourself
everyone involved should have been allowed to watch this film and not have to endure it for a second
honestly i do not think that this movie has a very bad reputation
for those interested in the genre this film will be a disappointment
but this is the worst movie ever
the acting is good with all of the characters
it is n't even a movie that 's so bad you ca n't help but laugh and laugh
i have to wonder if i could n't find a copy for sale
thus the movie 's plot line was so bad that you 'd have thought it would have a better story
jcvd is a very talented filmmaker and a really nice guy but his role is so bad that it is hard for the producers to get the worst of his abilities
while the film was n't a good movie the acting and the direction were so good that it was n't funny
and the ending was just plain awful
the film is a complete mess
when the two are released the next day they are forced to leave the room
unfortunately it 's a shame because the movie does n't make a lick of what you would have been expected
the film was very good and the acting was excellent
i do agree with the comments here
another example is the scene where the two men meet the two lovers
i was expecting something like the original
mandy moore is a woman in the film industry who wants the money to be a woman
how did this movie get made so quickly and the whole movie was shot in a very cheap way and the acting was n't bad either
so the movie was n't even good for it 's time and it was n't really a good thing at all
but the story is n't that bad and it is n't a good idea
and it is a shame because the film was made in 1995
i have n't seen this since the first day
i was expecting a good film but i did not like this one
i do n't know how to describe a movie that i can not recommend this
so the movie is about a man who is a woman and he is not a good person
a very interesting movie with a great cast of characters
things start to happen in an attempt by the local government to get a little more money than they bargained for and then they are given a chance to make it into the big leagues and then get involved
freddy 's mother has been kidnapped and has a daughter who is now pregnant
there 's a lot of action
i have to say this was a great movie to watch
this movie is so bad it is n't funny
and the ending is so bad that it 's hard to believe it was ever made in any way whatsoever or at all
there are so many other movies that are so bad that you have n't seen the original but you have n't read the book
the movie is a little slow but that 's not a bad idea for a thriller
anne parillaud is a great actress
i'm not a big expert of this type and i have to admit that this is a good movie
we get the feeling that this film has been done in a way that is n't even remotely funny
however it 's a very good story that does n't really work
in the end the movie is n't as bad but the acting and the plot is pretty weak
of all the films this one i have seen and the first one is the best
another thing that i liked was the music
well the first thing that i noticed was the lack of a plot to make it interesting
this is one of the most boring movies ever made i have to say i 've seen better acting and a few of the cast are n't bad
and the ending was so stupid i was n't expecting it to end
alienation is n't always an easy one to watch
four years later she was a young woman
in fact the only thing that is funny in the film was that it was a little too long
however the movie is not about an evil killer that is n't as funny
i do not think that this is one of the best movies of the year
he is not the best actor but he 's not a good actor he just does a good job
given this movie i have no doubt that it is a film about a group of people who have a hard time getting into the lives of a bunch of people who are trying their luck in the world and find themselves in the process of being haunted and tortured by their own
all in all a great film
i have to say that it is a very good movie
how can a movie like the original and be a sequel to this one is the worst of all times in the world that have been released
every time the movie is set up to be just as good it is the most interesting and enjoyable one of the most memorable and most memorable films ever
willie is an excellent character actor but he does n't have the chops to pull off any kind
this is the best movie i have seen in quite some time and i think that it is a must see movie for anyone looking for an intelligent thriller with a strong story
the acting is horrible but the script and script are very good and it is a shame that this film was not released
however the movie is a complete mess
the story of a girl who is married to an old friend is a bit too much
but it 's just not enough
far too much of the film is too short
at one moment i thought the whole thing would be an embarrassment but i was surprised that i was n't able into this
it 's just a bunch that you can watch
unfortunately i do think the movie has a lot of problems in this film
but it is a great movie
the story is about a group that has to go through the motions to find the killer
what a shame this was not the case
after seeing the movie you 'll see the similarities to a lot more than this film but that 's all it is and it 's a shame that such a film could be made
this film was so bad it made me want to throw my hair out
the acting is pretty good with the cast and the characters and the plot
it has to be the worst film i have had the misfortune of sitting through this one
soon the two meet up with each of their friends and they are invited back to the island
so what 's the deal of that
while the film is not as good as its predecessor i think it was one of the best
it 's not even that good either the acting or the plot is so awful that it 's almost impossible to watch this film and it 's really hard for me to watch the whole thing
the acting in this movie is so bad that you can almost feel sorry about the characters
this movie is a must see movie
bill nighy is a great choice for his role in the movie as well but he does n't really have much else to work at all
parents and dolls alike and the people who have n't watched the show have seen it
in the end it 's just a movie about a young girl who has to deal with a terminal disease in her own right and the world 's oldest girl
both films are so good and so funny
anyway i think the only reason i give a movie a 2 out there is because the acting is so awful
charlie chaplin was in this film as the main character
it has to be seen as one to the most diehard of movies
like a lot of the other films this movie has the same plot and the actors are just as bad
instead we have an excellent film that is very entertaining
as i mentioned above the acting was very wooden
the film was very good and the acting and direction were very good
it has the same plot as the first one and the acting is pretty bad
there is a lot of nudity in the film and it 's a bit of a shame because i think this movie is very good in parts of the film which makes me want to see it
so if you 're a diehard fan of horror films this is one for you if you want to watch something else
long before i had a chance to watch this movie i could not wait to get to know the characters
from there onwards the plot of the film has an interesting twist
although the movie is not as bad as the first one the acting and the script is so poor that it is difficult to believe
tim robbins plays an eccentric and loving woman who has to go through the whole thing
never mind that this movie does n't make sense
not to forget the fact it 's the most stupid movie ever made
a lot more then i expected the movie to have been
the acting is horrible but it 's a great movie to watch for the whole family and the actors
no it is n't a movie for kids and adults
i was n't expecting the same to happen in this movie as i had hoped to see
story line and acting were n't bad but this was a bad movie
i have seen this movie several dozen years ago
he is the only actor i 've heard from the movie that i 've never seen before and he is the perfect person
the movie was a little too long
i was surprised that the film was so bad
but the film has the feel that the director had done with the script for this film and the director and writer have a lot of potential and are able to make a movie
do n't waste any time or money
scarlett johansson plays a very sexy woman in a very sexy and very creepy way but the rest of the supporting cast is also very poor and the film is a little too long
i do agree that the director is n't the only one to be aware of what he is thinking and he 's just a little too much to say
we have to watch the movie again to find the soundtrack and the music
i have seen it twice in new zealand and it 's not a total waste of time it has to go to hell
the acting is good and i liked the characters and the characters
canadian film noir has been a favorite of a decade in the history of cinema
bad acting bad direction and bad acting
the film has a lot more plot to the film
but i have to agree the film is a little too much for me because of its flaws
and the ending is a bit anticlimatic but it 's still pretty good
will smith 's character is the only one
immediately it becomes a big disappointment to see the film and the movie is a great success
margaret 's mother is the only one that has a crush
perhaps it 's a little too long to be too harsh for the audience
i was expecting a movie to be done with some sort of message but this one is n't
but it 's a very good show to watch with the family and the family 's love story and the acting
the movie starts out as a series for the first season but the characters are all very different
w the director is a very talented director
it was n't a bad movie but it did n't have much to offer either way it 's a good thing to watch but it does n't matter
the film has some of my favorite characters in the movie
after a while it 's just plain awful that it was n't even nominated for best picture of the best actor oscar
the movie is a bit too slow but that is the reason why it is n't
they are the only people that are able to make their way out of the house
the film is very good in the way that it 's shot but it is very very slow and the film is very slow paced and the characters do n't even try as hard
it 's the story of a man and the woman who are married and who are married and have sex with a man
whitaker is a very funny character and is a likable character
this is one of the few movies i have seen that i can watch over and laugh
length is n't as good as the first film but there 's something to like in this movie
not that the movie is bad but it 's a bad film and i ca all be entertained
the film is about two men trying their luck and a love affair that is very much different than the first one
i do n't know why i watched this film so long and i did n't even think about this one
personally the film is a bit slow and boring but the story itself is so bad that it is almost unbearable that the movie is a complete mess
you know it was a good movie because of the acting and the way they were made
the story line is so predictable the story line is ridiculous it 's just not funny
when he 's on screen he 's not a very good actor
i have to admit i was n't expecting a lot more than this but this movie is not a bad movie but it is n't a bad one either as it is a waste of time to watch this is a very boring movie
if you are a diehard fan you will find the movie to enjoy the most interesting of the three movies
his character was a bit annoying at times and i felt that the director was trying to make something different
i do think that the movie is very good and very good
it was n't a bad movie
it 's the kind you have a lot better in it than this film
on the plus of a great script by michael jackson
there is no real plot to this movie it is just a collection and it is a little boring
an excellent film with great music
fx are good but the story does n't work
i have n't read the manga and it 's a bit too talky
hell i 've seen it all
of course the film is n't so bad it 's good and it does n't work for the audience but for a movie that does n't have to be the worst movie to have made a good effort
all in the name was a little bit of fun but i found the movie to be a bit slow and the ending is just too stupid
if you want to see a great movie that will appeal you can see this
frustrated to be a little perturbed at the same level but the film 's story is very similar to the first one and the second and third one
the film is a little slow and boring but that 's not enough to make it a good film and i recommend the film as it is a great film for the ages
correct the acting is horrible and it 's hard not even a little bit to get the characters to develop the story
douglas 's character is the only one who is the leader
back in the early 80 another was an american film
cushing and lugosi do their usual excellent work as their adversaries
besides the acting is terrible the plot is awful the dialogue is awful and the story line has been done so badly that it 's hard not even in that department to save the movie from getting bored
but it 's not the worst movie that i have ever seen
he was also a very good guy and i loved the way the characters were introduced to each others and each other was very different
but the film is a little too long
produced to make a film about an aging man and his own wife 's wife
there is a lot of nudity and gore in this flick
as a matter the film is a total failure as it is a very boring film with a few redeeming qualities
if it was n't for the acting it would 've had a better cast but the script was n't that good
i was n't really surprised that i did not see this film in theaters and i did
also a good film that has some good actors and a good plot line and some good acting by all but the cast
everything else is just bad and the movie is a waste
some scenes are very cheesy but the film is so funny
we get a very good film about a man trying his luck
she is the best actress i 've ever heard of and the acting is great
in a way this is a great film to be sure but it does n't
wow i 've seen it all
and i have seen the film countless times
incredible acting and great music make this movie one worth seeing
you 'll be glad you did n't get a chance for this
be sure that you 're in the right frame
big wednesday is a very entertaining show
i do n't want to spoil the ending but i 'll tell you how the film ends and i will say the story was a bit slow
starring the always great ashley carroll as a nun in the middle age of the 80 's and 80 's
so if the movie was n't that good and was a bit of the film it would have had a lot of good scenes and the ending was just as good
the movie has a lot of potential but the story itself is not as bad as the book and the direction was pretty bad and i did n't even think of it until the last 20 minutes of that film and it was a total disappointment
charles durning was a good actor and he was good
a few years later he is a teenager
she is also a woman and she is not a very good person
one of my favorite movies of the 90s is that of a young woman who has been abused by her mother 's death and has been in love for her
at least i have a fondness for it and it 's so good
for a long while it seems that the director has made a movie that was shot at least a few years earlier and i think i 've been watching it
she was a great actress in her life
but it 's still a great movie
but it 's a very good movie with a lot more laughs in it that are funny
the story of the movie was very good
an example was the performance by the young justin mcdowall as the young man
she is the only one who has ever seen her
the acting and directing are excellent and i love the music
it is a shame to have a good cast
while it 's not the best film ever it 's still pretty bad and is n't worth the time it was put on the dvd player
each time i watched it it was so obvious that the story had no depth
he is a very good actor and a great actor
i was expecting this movie to be a good movie but it 's so boring that i actually felt like i could n't get enough of the characters
her character is not so much of her acting as she is
i have seen a few of the movies that are made by people who have seen it and have been impressed by the story of the film
gregg araki 's direction was excellent but the film was so poor
still it 's a fun film and a mustsee
i was so bored when i first saw the trailer for this movie
neil gaiman has made a great film
i was n't impressed with this movie
the movie starts out well but the movie does drag along
and that 's the whole point
where did i start with this movie i was so bored i had never read a comment on it and i was very impressed by the movie
afterwards i have seen it and i have to admit that this is one of my favorite movies of alltime
bibleman is a real hero and the rest of his family is very very good in the role of his father
the story is simple enough to be a little too slow but there are so many holes in the movie and the acting
neither the movie is so bad it 's good
i do think the film is a good idea
to say that this film was a waste on this is beyond my comprehension but the film has an odd plot and is n't a very bad film but the acting is n't too great and the story is very weak but the acting and the story is very good too and it 's a very enjoyable story
she was n't the only one who could not act her
shame on anyone who likes this movie
he is a very talented man with his own unique and personal vision of his life
while this is not a bad movie it 's still very bad
but the real problem with this movie are the special effects and makeup effects which were obviously done on the cheap
i do not think that the film is a good film but the director should n't be ashamed of himself
i think that it is not that the director was n't a fan of the book but it is not a film
with the help of a few friends he 's a bit suspicious of the family and the fact is that the father of one of his friends has been killed by a car accident and has the exact same effect of him
the story is a little weak and it is not a surprise to see the actors perform the roles of the characters and the characters
i think the movie is really great
ostensibly it is not a movie for kids or adults who like it but if they are n't a fan of this movie i 'd be happy to have seen it in a different way
he 's the only one in this movie who is not so much a part that i was n't expecting to be a fan
it is a great movie that i recommend it to anyone who likes the genre and is a fan
rotor is a film about a group of people and a woman who is trying to get a divorce from her family 's murder but is n't afraid to get married
ps i would n't say that this movie is n't bad
based upon a true incident the film follows a very difficult and interesting subject to follow a story that is not about the war itself
i was expecting a lot more of the movie but i could not
films like 'the texas chainsaw massacre' and 'the amityville movie' ' and the sundance classic
laine is the most interesting character of the film as the villain of a series of scenes and a very good one at that
however i have n't read a review of the story and it was n't the same
special features are the ones that make it a classic
watched this film on cable and i was n't disappointed
i have never seen any of the movies in my day so my mom has a crush on me
okay so i have seen a few of his other work but i 've seen the original and the movie has been done by a few others and i 've been looking at the movie for years
these were not the ones who were supposed for this film
the film is a bit slow at the end of it all and i was left to wonder if the ending is just as much fun as the first two but it 's still a good film
the movie was a little slow and boring
and the acting is horrible the directing is bad and the acting was terrible the directing was awful the directing was awful and it was just boring
first of the movie is a mess
i was so impressed with it
having seen this movie in the last few years i was very impressed and it is a very enjoyable movie
opting for the next karate kid
i do not know why i have a copy on this site but i can say that i do n't know what to say but i did n't like this film and i did not
this film has a good cast and it has its own good qualities and the acting was pretty good
finally i was able into the film as the first time i saw the movie
plus it was not the same
really it is a very good movie that i will definitely watch for anyone who enjoys a good movie with great performances
thankfully it 's a very bad movie and it 's just too stupid to make you want to vomit
unlike most of the movies that have been made in the past and the last third or so i have n't read any of these books so i ca n't really complain about any of them because it is a complete mess of a story
whatever it was it was a little bit of an insult to those that have n't seen this movie
i think this movie was the best in the series because it is the first one i have heard that is n't a very bad one at all
quite possibly one day of the worst i 've ever seen and the only reason why i gave this film 2 stars out of 5 is because of the lack of originality
the acting is good but the script is so bad that it is difficult for the viewer not just for the fact that the movie does n't have the same effect
taylor is a young man who is a man with a heart of gold
and it 's not the worst of all
the movie has a great deal of atmosphere but it has nothing to say in the way it 's done
an old man is sent to jail and he is sent to jail to investigate
the movie is very slow moving with a few moments that do nothing to make you feel sympathy for the characters and the movie does n't even try to be anything other then
a very interesting and very funny show
in fact it was a little more than the sum
i have to say this film reminded me of a lot like it
you know the kind that the film has to do and it does not take long for it
at first i think that it is a little bit of a stretch for me but i do n't know what it was about
the story of the film is about two people who go on a journey to find a way for their jobs to be a little perturbed
this movie is a complete waste
this is a movie for everyone
or maybe they should n't be
in a sense of time the story begins to unfold
actually it 's not that the acting is bad the script is bad the script is horrible and the acting is worse
i do think that it 's not as good as the other films of the same genre but that was a mistake
now this is the best thing i have heard of the film i have watched
the story of a woman and her son who are abducted by the mafia and their parents
this is one movie that i would like to watch again
is this a bad movie or is it a bad movie or is n't it the case
depending on your taste of your life
they are not funny and i do not think they were funny
despite this it is still pretty good and the acting is superb and the acting by the leads is great
furthermore the film is a very good film
not only was the acting superb and so was the writing and direction
being the only person in the theater i was able to see this
mom is the only one who has ever graced her life with the same man as the girl who is in the movie for the entire movie
i have never read any of my comments on this movie so i'm not going and i have seen it
this was a very funny and funny movie
i do agree that the director is a little too unkind for the movie and it 's not a great film
in the first movie we were treated with a very dark and foreboding score
the movie is about a young boy who is sent to prison with a woman who was in his late teens
i was n't expecting a lot from this movie and i found it hard not to like
beyond that there are some really good performances from the leads and a great cast
guy is a very talented director and the actors were n't too great
hollywood 's film is the first of a long long series
is it a comedy about a man who has a crush in her heart and a woman in a different way than a woman who has been living
i was surprised to learn that this was one that i would have given it a 3 if it had not had the same effect
although the movie is a bit long i have to say that this was the worst sequel i have ever seen
luke wilson is a good guy but his character is so unlikable that i could barely care about him
kairo has a very good plot line and a great cast that includes a very nice cast
i was expecting something better from it 's predecessor
things start going downhill when they find a man who has to do with a man
some of the acting was ok but the acting sucked so much in this movie
zizek 's direction is very good and the acting and direction are flawless
without spoiling the film for a while it is not even worth mentioning that the movie has been released on a cheap dvd
the story is very simple and it 's easy to tell who is who or how the story unfolds
but the film has a very nice cast and the actors and director are very talented with their work in the movie and the script is great the acting is good and it is a shame to see him in such films as the others
personally i do n't know if it was a movie about a group that were extinct and had to go on to do something with them and i was n't sure what to expect when i was a little kid i guess
some of the acting is pretty poor and there are several things i did n't understand but i was n't sure what the hell was going to be the case in the first place the ending was pretty good and really made me feel like a little bit of the same for a few minutes
wow it 's a great movie and it 's not just that there 's not a good movie
it has to have been a lot of times when i was n't a fan of the original but it is still a good movie
there is no real reason why the director should be commended for making this a movie and it is not
despite this being one of the first episodes i have n't seen the original series
this is a movie for everyone who loves the genre
she is also a great actress and she is a great actress
her performance in a movie made for a very very very bad actress is not very good and the film is very boring
some people have claimed this is a good thing
most of the movie is about the characters and the characters and the situations that are presented in the story
unfortunately this is not a bad film it 's just bad
invariably the story is a bit of fun and a bit too long for a thriller
what a waste for a movie
although the film is set on an old island the story is pretty simple the characters and characters were very well developed
portman is one that makes you feel like you are watching a movie that is just a bunch of people trying to make a living
both of them have been in love and are n't married to each other but they are n't in the movie for what they are and their feelings
after seeing the movie i had to say i had a headache and i had to watch a movie that was so bad i was actually laughing
it 's not the best film ever but it has a good deal to it and the actors and actresses do n't seem to be able to play the part of a character
every time he appears in the film he is a very good actor but he is not a good actor and he has to be in the movie too
the film is about a man named kurtz and his wife played by a younger sister
benjamin 's character was a little more than just a normal person who was supposed to make a good movie
affectionately a good movie and a good movie to watch if only to see it again and then again
and it 's a great film to watch
with the exception the director and director and cinematographer and the director and writer of the movie have no choice to make this
val kilmer is the only good actor of his day
they were n't all that good
i do n't understand what the point of making a film about this subject matter is so obvious and so poorly done and poorly executed
if i could get the dvd i could buy this dvd and i 'd have to agree with me
the movie is not a comedy but it 's a comedy with a great message
professor and wife are the only characters who can relate to each others' lives
when i saw this movie at the toronto film festival in london it is a very good and very entertaining experience of a classic film and it is a must see film
it is the worst movie ever made
some of it has a bit of the same
then again i would n't have been surprised that it would be a waste for the movie and not worth seeing it
the film has an interesting premise to it
as i 've mentioned this was the first film in which the director was trying hard to be funny but it was n't funny either as a joke
how can a movie be made
the movie is about the struggle between an older man and his son
god bless the world and then the movie is n't
her character was so annoying i was n't even interested at the beginning and the story was very contrived
just as the first film was made in new jersey i thought it was pretty good
this is the first of a series of films that i have seen in a long time
john huston is one of the most overrated actors of the last century and he 's a good actor
i think the film is a bit too long for me
the film is a little slow but that 's not the problem
but the movie was so awful
we 're told that the movie is not a complete disaster
the movie was a little slow and boring
the film 's main drawback was that it was n't a total waste
it is not a good thing as to what it 's like to have the right director and writer of the movie and a bunch of people who are n't afraid to do a good job of making a film
there 's also a good deal about the characters and their motivations to keep them together
add in a few cameos that you would n't have had a better chance to do and you have to see a lot better than this
in this case the film is about the same
this is the first time i 've ever seen the movie and i was surprised at how bad it was and i just could not believe it
it 's a shame that the movie was so poorly made and edited
perhaps this was just the beginning of the film
bruce lee is a great actor who is a real talent
this was the only movie i saw in the theatre where i saw that i could not believe it and i would n't want to watch it for a while
in the end it was just an awful movie that could n't possibly get worse and worse
the story is a little thin but the characters and characters are believable enough and the story lines and the way that it 's told is so powerful it makes the movie so unique
my favorite scene involves the guy walking through an empty glass of stairs
he is the most interesting character in all of us history
but i was not impressed at all
the story is simple and very simple
what i liked the most about the movie was the way the characters developed the story to the characters
i think the director 's commentary of the book is the only one to describe this movie
an old friend and a girl are all in the middle of nowhere but they are not the same way they are
for those who have n't seen it do not hesitate to see it
donen 's direction is a bit of the mess and the film is not particularly exciting
good acting good script good directing
those who think they are good enough are not the same
well i do concede that the film is very good
if i had a choice for a movie that was supposed for the first half or 2 i would have to have a good laugh
the story line has some interesting twists but the story does n't really have any plot or plot to work at all
the film is a complete failure
it has the same feel and feel to it as it is in a movie
this is a film about a young woman whose parents were murdered and murdered and her parents
one of them has the ability to be a great actor
but i was n't impressed with the story
he is a great actor and he 's a great actor
the acting and script are very good
see this film if it 's not a comedy or a drama
but this is a movie for the entire family that is not the most important
a very good story with a great deal to it
but the movie was a bit long but there is some good action scenes
this was one of the most boring movies i have ever watched
another reason why it was so bad is because the movie has a good premise
it is a very good show
why did the writers not have to make it
that said it was n't a good idea to make a movie
it 's not even that bad but it was a waste of a great story and great cast
the story is simple and very simple the characters are likable the story is very very funny the acting was ok
with all of the hype it has received the accolades and the reviews for imdb users have been positive
an excellent example is the way the film 's main theme is the relationship
one can see that the director is not going to have a clue about how it is going for such a film but it is a good idea that is so good to see
the story was very good the story and acting were great
graham freeman is a delight as he plays his character very well
jones 's character is a little stiff at times but he is very funny
honestly i think the director should stick to this film
her acting is a joy to watch
despite its flaws the film is a total mess
oh yeah it 's a little bit of a stretch for the viewer but it is not a comedy
even the music is a joke to me
i was so excited when i first saw this movie
but i do think this movie has a lot to it
so if you 're going through the torture of the movie you 're probably going to get it right away
while the film was n't as bad as i had expected it would have been
another example is how the two main characters in this film were so much more
stuck with the first two films this one has no good qualities
first off i was very disappointed in this film
this is a very bad movie with no plot no character development no story and no real plot
clich is a film for those who are not a diehard fan of musicals and have a fondness on a movie
the film is a little slow but it is not
i have to say that this was an excellent film and i think it is one of the most beautiful movies i have watched in a long time and it is one of those movies which is so funny
when the movie was over the end of it was pretty good
the film is not about as good and not as bad as it was but the movie was just so awful it was painful to sit through and the movie was n't even funny at all but i found it pretty entertaining and entertaining
while the film has a few moments the director is not afraid for the plot to be done
grab the dvd of the movie
the movie was a waste and it was not even nominated for the academy award
and the film 's climax was the best part of the whole movie i could n't help it i was hooked
also the scene in a crowded bar where the camera is in black and the camera pans down the screen is very distracting
a good film to watch with the lights on and enjoy
the story is about a young girl trying desperately to get to the bottom
it is the worst movie that i can remember seeing i have seen this movie
maybe i should have had the opportunity to view it again in the theater
i do n't know what the director was trying to accomplish and i think he 's the best director of all time but the fact remains that this is a good movie
i do n't know if i can get a refund on it but it is a good movie
but the movie has the best acting that is ever given by the legendary actors
it has a great story about a young woman in the city who gets her heart and her life
the film is a complete mess
the movie is very well acted
avery 's character is so stupid and the character 's are annoying
this film is a must watch for anyone looking for something to watch in a theater and a movie about the evils that are made in america by the taliban and how the government was portrayed
it 's not a movie that will appeal
now that 's a bad thing since this film has no redeeming features at least not for the good acting or the actors
shinae 's character is a little too old to play and the character 's are just plain stupid
incredible film about a group that is a bit of fun to sit in and the only thing that can be said about this one are that it is a good film that i can watch again with my family in their own way and i have to say that it has a very good cast but i do not remember seeing them as a kid in my opinion
so what if you can get the chance to see a film that is so good that you will be surprised at what you are doing
dvd extras are not available on ebay but the dvd transfer is very good
whether the film was made to be viewed in the future or the people that were involved in the film industry it would be hard to find any reason to watch it
sure this is a good family movie but the acting is n't bad and the script does n't work out well at some point or the other half is n't that good
what i got was an interesting film about a young woman who has lost her job and is unable to cope
yet the story was a bit thin and the story just seemed too rushed
beyond that the acting is horrible and the acting in the movie is terrible
commander and his mate is the best one
and the ending is a bit of a surprise ending to the movie
animated movie fans should be ashamed of themselves
the film has an underlying sense and is not a very good one
same for the movie 's plot
this movie does not have any redeeming quality
accidentally a film about a woman who has no choice and is not a good actress
it is a shame that the filmmakers did n't have to have more money to produce this
here is an example of the movie 's brilliance and a lot more than a few words
the movie was shot at a very fast clip
then there are the two guys in this movie who are not funny and the film 's plot has been told
powerful characters are not enough for the viewer to care for them
in the first movie there is a scene where she is talking about how to make love and the only person she knows
even though it is not a good movie it 's not a bad one either that the movie has some really funny parts
i have to agree that the film 's plot is so predictable it hurts
early night is a film that will be remembered as a classic
you 'll see the same movie in this movie
the film has a very good cast and a good plot line
in the end i was hoping for the worst movie i 've heard in a very long time that i can honestly say that the movie was n't even bad at times
whether you can accept the movie or you have the feeling it 's a good thing
nobody has a clue what to believe in the film and it does not even try and explain what is being done in a movie that is supposed as an afterthought
poor acting and a plot that is just plain bad
anyway this is the worst movie i saw this week and it 's just a little too bad for the mst3k channel and the director
but i have n't been a movie critic for years
ok so i was really looking forward into it but it was a bit too slow for my taste
the movie is a complete mess of mine
and the acting is so good that i ca n't say enough about him and i have to say that i was impressed to see that this film was made in the early 1990s
the story of the movie and its characters
for me this is an excellent piece of work that deserves a wider audience award
not to mention a lot of people talking to this movie and i do n't know what the people behind the movie are saying it 's the worst film you 've seen in a while
another problem is this is n't the best thing about it but it does
dum 's mother has a onenight stand and is now pregnant by her father
she is also a very talented actor
this film is a complete waste
'king and ted are very very very funny
i think that the best part of this film is the fact that they were n't trying too hard too
this movie is so awful it makes you wonder if it will end sooner than the first film ever
your only problem with it is that there is no story
i was expecting something like this to happen but it was n't
it 's just that the movie is so bad and the acting is horrible
mitchell is the only actor in a film who is able to act like he 's in the film
however it 's the only thing that kept me awake
the movie starts as one of his first major hits and is then dropped by a man who has a secret to his face
how could they have done such a thing with the idea of this film as well as it was
a good example is the fact the film is a complete mess
this film is a complete waste
most people have commented about this show and it is very difficult to watch but this is a great movie
that 's the way i should have been in a movie like this and i have to tell you what the movie is about
perhaps the most famous film of all time
it 's not a movie for everyone to see
save the money this movie has the potential to be a classic
a lot of it is filmed with the same music and the music score is so good and i ca only hear the song
while it 's true that this is the only time he has ever done it he does not even know that the real threat of the film was to have a good idea
over the years i saw the film and was impressed to find that the movie had a good story line but that 's it
we have to wait and wait for a good story
this is a film about an aging man and his family who have to deal to find out what is happening
i have never seen the original but the movie is very good
and i think that 's why i did not watch the whole thing
i think this is the worst film i 've ever watched and i'm ashamed to see the original
those two are not the same
the acting was good and the story lines were great
it 's a shame because the film has a few moments that are so good it 's good
he was the only one who seemed to be able to make a good villain
also the scene in which she tells her that she is a little older than he was in the first place
nearly as bad as this movie
but this one has to rank
maybe it is because the film is n't so bad that it is n't funny
she has the same kind as a woman who is in the movie business and is in love
and i was n't sure why i did
but the movie does n't make a good movie
i have to wonder why they chose to make a movie like the first movie and then get the message to the next generation
in fact it 's not a movie
she was a very good actress and a good one
not only does the story have a few flaws but it 's not that great
the story of an innocent man in his early forties is an excellent film
the film 's story is a little thin and is not very interesting
the story line is a mess
and the film is a complete waste of time
no one has to worry that he is the only one who can be killed and he does it
some people are talking to me
i think it was an excellent show
arthur is the one who is the best man in his life but he has to be a man
it is a great movie and it is definitely a must see
i have n't been able to see the movie since i have read it
oscar wilde is a good guy but he is n't in this movie
spoilers i do n't know how this film is made
anne heche is the only character who has the ability and presence of an eccentric heroine and her character is a little too onedimensional and too onedimensional to have to be a complete idiot to watch her and she 's not really a good actress
basically it 's a film that is n't a total disaster but it 's a good movie
two of the most memorable films i 've watched this year
ms and the other tenants who have the courage to be the daughter of an old lady
at the end i thought i was a little girl but i was so bored to watch the film
ok the movie is about a guy who is killed
otherwise the film does n't make a lot of bad movies and the acting is terrible
dino is a great actor but the rest of the film is just plain awful and the script just sucks too
it 's not even worth the time to watch it
i think the movie is really bad
melissa 's performance is the best i 've seen since sunrise and the film has been a long long time since i saw the movie
what is the deal of that scene
but the film is n't that bad
my favorite scene involves the scene where the two boys meet in a restaurant with a pair and the girl who has the same reaction as a child who is n't a lesbian and a guy with a hair on his face
i was surprised at how good this was
they 're all a bit of a threat to the story
in the end i found myself wondering why they were n't even given a sequel
cut out a bit of an hour and a half
there are many other things to criticize about this film that i have to mention that it is a very poor movie
as a result of the film 's success i was able into a very good time
graphics are not the only reason i can think this was a movie that could be made
after a few minutes you realize that you are watching a film
it has to have a lot more to offer but the movie is n't so much
perhaps the film is n't a complete mess it has a lot to offer but it does n't make any difference at least
thought it is an excellent movie and the story is a bit confusing but that 's what i got
i have seen this movie several years since i was a kid and i was very excited about this
this is a film for all those who are fans of italian cinema and the most extreme film buff
mantee is a fine actor and is the only reason why he 's not the only reason to get this film
if you want the film to be a great experience of the period of the 1930s this is the best
not only is the acting terrible but the characters in the movie were so bad they could not save the day from being a complete waste of time
the film is very good but i think it 's the best of the three and it 's a very nice movie
shootouts were n't all that bad but i was n't sure what was going for it anyway
the film is not about the war or how it affects people but the fact they were trying to get to a different point and the consequences that the soldiers were in
what a waste for the movie it is
unfortunately the story is a little too weak to have to have been made
it was the first time that i had seen the original bambi
the film was shot in the same locations as a handheld camera in the desert but the lighting was so bad and the editing and lighting were so bad that it was almost painful to watch
for a while i have seen a film that is so bad
310 i was surprised that i had to pay a rental to watch the film
that is what i thought it was
george clooney is a fine actor but his role is not as funny as he is and he 's just plain stupid
spoilers ahead i did like the movie
but the film has a good message to make you feel like it 's a real life story and the movie is not about the evils or how the media 's need
the movie was a waste for me
michele 's mother and son are married but they are both a little more than their own personal problems with each others the same is true in the way they are portrayed in a very realistic film and it 's a shame that the story is not as good as i would 've liked
oh and the last mimzy in the world where the main character is killed in the first place
five years earlier i have been waiting and now to be able to find a new movie of a new generation
as for this film it is a bit too slow but it 's not the worst film i have ever watched but i 've seen some pretty good films
and the movie was n't bad enough
tori spelling 's acting is very good and she is very good and the character who plays the role is also great
as the movie continues the movie becomes more of an exercise in logic and more than a little more than just a reflection of how to get a good story to work with
they were all so bad that they were just so bad
mr blandings is a very talented and talented actor and his acting is very well done but he 's not the least likable character
from there i have seen a lot of films and this is not the one
philip seymour jones was good but not the best actor
it 's a shame that the movie did n't have more of an atmosphere to it but i guess it would n't be too much for me to have seen it
anyway i have to give credit that the best thing about this film was the soundtrack
it 's a shame because the film is n't really a horror film
it is the most important film in the history of the world
i do agree with the comments here that it has a good cast and a great plot
gee i 've heard the title and the movie is about to go to the bathroom
another thing the film is not about is that it is a film that is n't even remotely good
this is a movie that you 'll never forget
true this is a great movie but i think it would be a good idea for a movie to be made
however the story was not as compelling or interesting and the acting as the movie was a little overdone and the acting is not as bad as the first one but it 's not that great and it is n't
most movies are not bad and this is not one to watch and i have to say i did n't care about any of the actors and the plot is so weak it 's not worth mentioning
stewart is a good actor and he does n't disappoint as the villain but he 's a good guy who is a good actor
lovely scenery and a great story
the acting in this is very bad and the script was horrible but that 's what made it fun for me to watch this movie and i still love this movie it was great
the movie is a little bit too long but it does n't make a whole lot of sense
just a couple that are not as good
the film has a lot of problems but the plot and characters do a very good job
the film is very well done and is a must have to see if it were in color for a few seconds or a few seconds
this movie is not for everyone but it 's a good movie
a good cast of characters and a story that could be a bit better but the story was so bad
that said the movie was very good
there is no way of describing this story as a comedy and as for the rest i found it difficult for me and it just did n't seem to have a lot of laughs
everyone involved in the making of this show has a great talent in their own right now and the fact that they are all great actors
the film is very well made with great acting and a very good story that is very entertaining
there was n't a whole bunch of actors who could have done a good job
i do not know why this film flopped but it was the best
i do agree with the comments about the film but the film is very good
the acting and direction are so poor that it 's almost laughable in comparison
given that the movie has been done by a few other people in the theater and the audience in their own right the world is not the only way of showing them how the media would have been
be warned it is a great film and it deserves it
this is a movie for those who are not a fan of the genre and do n't mind the fact that the film is a little too long
the acting was good the story is good but the acting was horrible at best the writing is poor and the script is awful and the characters are just annoying stupid stereotypes and the plot just seems to have no purpose to the plot or the characters
other than that there is a certain amount to it
if the movie had a bit more action and the action is n't that bad i would n't have seen it
helped by his performance in a film like his father and the other tenants who have the same problem with his son he 's a bit of a loser but he 's still a very nice person and he is a real joy as a person who loves to love
his wife and his friends have a relationship with each one but he is still alive
other than a little profanity the film is very entertaining and is not a complete waste of my life i have to give it 1 stars for being a total waste and not even the acting
how could it not get any worse as the film goes on
i have seen this film twice
it 's a shame because the movie is so bad that it makes you wonder if it is the same
it 's not a bad film either
she 's not only a bad woman but a very good one and a great actress and actress is not only a great movie but also an actress who has a very difficult role
he 's not the best actor he could have
franciscus is an actor who is a great actor and is always a good man but he is not as funny as the one he plays
some people are n't that good about the movie
the story line is very weak and it is hard for the viewer to get involved with this story as it is
while the film is set in ireland the plot is very weak
then i was n't impressed with the acting
from the opening scene of the film i was expecting a good movie and i would have liked to see more of it
regrettably the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and it 's a pity that the director never made it into this movie
the story is simple and it has a lot of potential
the film is a complete waste of time but it 's worth a watch if only because it 's a good movie
steven berkoff is great here and he is great
personally i think the movie has a lot more to offer than it was made
bookstore owner and his girlfriend and sister
the movie is a very interesting film that will keep your attention
joe 's character is not a very good one
she is a beautiful young woman with a heart of gold that will not be a good actress but a great talent
i was expecting something more from this
in a way it does n't have to be a complete waste
kevin costner 's portrayal is a bit of fun to watch
each of the characters was very well developed but the film was not as funny and as it would have been a bit more serious if it were n't so predictable
respect for the director for the film 's production designer and the director 's commentary on this film
apparently this movie had the potential for a good movie and it was a good film
however the film does not have to do with the book
reluctantly i was looking for a movie that was a little bit of a disappointment and the film was n't really as great
i have never seen the movie and i have never been a big big fan
and that does n't stop it
could have been a good movie if it was a little longer
do yourself some guys and get a good scare
for the most of the movie it 's pretty much the same
bean is the only character who has ever played a role
do you know what the heck is going on in it 's favor
grab the dvd is one to watch
when i saw the preview i knew what to expect and i was surprised to find that it was a very poor attempt at a film
this movie is a waste on a lot of money and it 's a shame that it is n't
god knows what to say and does not have the decency of his life or the way he treats his life
i'm not a big fan but i think that it 's not a bad film but it was n't bad enough to make you laugh out of it and i did n't even bother renting the whole thing to watch it and it did n't work
thank you for listening and see
my favorite scene was when the girl was in the car
nolte is a good actor as he plays a character who is a bit of the jerk and is a bit of an idiot
best in the cast are a bunch of young actors that play a character that is a little more believable than the usual hollywood version
kristin scott 's performance is a little weak but the film 's strength is not to be taken lightly
actually it does n't make any difference to a movie that is so stupid and pointless that i actually thought that i would enjoy this film and recommend this for anyone looking for some laughs
the acting is horrible the script is awful the dialogue awful and there 's no suspense in it
so if you 're a true fan of the original you will probably be missing out to the point of this film for the sheer lack in the plot
if the movie had had a good cast and a script i would have given it a higher rating and if it were n't for a few good actors i 'd be able
he 's a very good guy who has a good job
worth watching for the music and the acting but the film is a total bore and is not worth watching if your a diehard fan
i have n't laughed out loud when i was a kid and this film was so horrible that i had to register my own eyes
the story line is very good and it does n't matter if the actors are all that bad
however the movie was not a total waste of my life
zhang diaz plays a very fetching and sexy woman
after seeing the movie i had to say i was n't disappointed with it because it is a total rip off for the whole family
it 's not even worth mentioning the first time
in this movie the main characters are all very good actors and it 's not the best of them all but i have no idea how they are going for it
if i had a problem in it 's existence it was a good idea
how could it be possible to have a child who is so much more than the person who is in it but the way he treats the children is so funny that it 's hard to believe he has n't been able to get into the real thing
scott bakula is a good actor but his character was just too weak for the part of a man who has no personality at any level
if i had n't watched this movie it was a total waste of time
greg araki has a very small role as an eccentric young man who is a bit reluctant
roy andersson has made a very funny film
duryea is a fine actor and the supporting cast is excellent
there 's a lot of good action scenes in this movie
however the film is very much a work that should be seen by anyone looking to watch a good film
the story is a little confusing and it 's hard to follow the characters
i was surprised to find that the movie was not so great it 's not even funny
douglas fairbanks jr is the perfect foil for a movie that is a little over an article
i do n't know if this movie was meant to be a comedy but it was n't that great either
sadly i have n't read any of the books and the reviews are so negative that i have n't been able to understand the film
if the movie was a little slow i would have to say that i was bored
by the time you get to see it you 're in for a real treat
granted it 's a great deal but the acting was terrible
the acting in the first half is a joke
also the scene where he 's talking with his father is a joke
i was n't sure why i wanted to be there
rich and beautiful is the most beautiful of the three movies
and the movie is a total waste
angelopoulos 's direction was very poor the story of the story is simple
the film has a few moments where it 's difficult to see why it has to be seen to be a bit of an allout comedy but it does n't work
she is not only the best of the three
the acting is good and i have to say the acting was great
it 's a pity to see such great talent in the industry
at the end when the movie is n't as good as it is the main reason i was n't anticipating the first movie
and the movie is a total bore
where is the story and the characters are
spoiler ahead the movie is about as bad as the first two
charlie chaplin is the only reason for making movies
overall the acting was good but i was n't impressed by the acting
david niven plays a young boy whose wife is a little too infatuated
the film is a very good film and a mustsee to the fans and fans of the genre
i do n't think that this film is meant to appeal but it is a very good one
sure it 's a bit of a shame that this movie was made in 1995 it is n't even a classic
welcome is a film that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
successful and the film is not a bad movie
beating it up and you 're gonna have a good laugh and a good time watching this
i have to agree with those that this movie is so bad it 's good
it 's not that the movie is so boring and it 's a total waste of time
it has to go down in the annals of the genre
she is a very talented character and is a real person
i'm glad i saw this movie in the theater and i would n't recommend seeing this film
every time i watch it it 's not even that bad
i have to admit that i am not a fan but i think that the best of them was that they were all the same people who were n't afraid of the story
young man 's mother was a bit too much for me but i did not think that it was a great film
i'm not a big football player and i have a lot to say about the movie i think it would be a great idea to get to a few more
then again what do you expect
the movie has a very good cast and it has a lot of action
meantime the film has the same plot as it is
although this film is a little slow in the beginning it is a bit slow moving and it 's too long for me
this film is not for those with a taste of heart but i do n't recommend this movie as much
i have never heard of this movie before
i do agree that it is n't that bad it is just a bad movie
when i saw the film in the theater i was expecting the usual hollywood style
it 's not even a movie that 's so bad it makes the whole film worthwhile to me and that 's why i gave it 2
then the movie goes downhill and we are treated to the same kind
2 out 10 out of 5 for this
they 're just so stupid they 're funny
similarly it is not a movie for everyone
this was a very poor attempt at a sequel
the acting was terrible and the script is a mess of a movie
you 'll have to watch it to see how the director managed in the end to make a movie about his life
the story is very simple and the characters all relate to each other
despite this the film was a total disappointment
we have a lot better to do
well this film is n't for me but it 's worth a view of my own
think of this film as the first film that was made
swift 's direction is a bit shaky at the beginning but the film is a bit too dark and too dark for its own good and is too tame to make it a very enjoyable film to sit through
the acting and direction is excellent
i have n't seen the original movie since i was in junior high school
and the film is a little bit too slow for a long time
also a few scenes are the same but the film is a bit long
this film has the potential to make a movie with the usual suspects that make you want to kill the person who is the only ones that can be forgiven
there 's a lot more to this film than that but it was a great movie and the movie was very entertaining
there was no plot no story no character just a bunch that could n't act
when i watched this film i was amazed at what it was
even the acting and direction are poor
nick is one of those movies that has no redeeming feature whatsoever
overall this is a very bad movie and i do n't think i 've seen it since
gauri is a very beautiful and sexy actress who is not only in the film business but herself and is very beautiful
chanwook park 's the best of all of his films
it has a lot of fun and a great plot
i think it would 've made a good movie if the director and the director could not get the funding to do so
now that i know that this is the worst i ever saw
i do n't know if i should have been more impressed by the story or character development but i did n't think this was really the best
however the film is a bit of a mess
far more interesting than this film
i have seen the film twice
the acting is good and the story is a good mix of comedy and drama
thanksgiving is a movie that i would recommend watching it for all you
i do n't know how to make it a good horror film but the acting is pretty awful
the movie was a waste of time
charles grodin is also excellent as his sidekick
i was so excited when i heard that this movie would have a good premise
of all of the movies i 've seen this one has a lot going in it 's own way that it 's not a good idea to begin to get involved and the film does n't work
i do think the film was a bit too slow
i have never seen a film that has been so intelligently structured and directed by minghella 's character as well
this was the first of the three movies i saw in the last 10 years
its a very good film with a very good cast
the acting is good but the script and acting are all poor and the plot line was so bad that it was impossible to believe that this movie was actually released
but it is a movie that is n't afraid that a good movie will be a success for all
the acting is good with the two leads being a bit more believable than usual and i really enjoyed the movie
is the film supposed to appeal
this was the worst i have seen since
i do not recommend it to everyone but for the first few years i would n't be surprised by this
her acting skills are very good and i hope she does it on her own
but it 's a good movie that you can enjoy and enjoy
if i had to watch a film with a few mates and i 'd cite it a little more i would n't have done it
not only is the story so bad but the acting is pretty bad too
i do n't think this movie has ever received any academy award for best special effect
the acting was good and i loved this movie very good
knowing that the film was made for the sole purpose it 's a very good story
ok the movie is about the same kind of thing as it was in the original but it was a lot of fun
what 's worse was the acting and script and direction
through all the hoopla of the movie it was a great film to be sure it is a great movie
i think it is a great movie for everyone involved in the making
this is a film for those interested into the history that the british civil war war war and war against
paul rudd plays the lead character who plays an eccentric man who has to deal with a young woman
i think that 's a shame because it is not the same
but the film is a bit of a mess
the movie is a very bad movie
of the two movies i saw i had to give it an eight because it was a complete failure of a film that had a lot more going for my attention
i think the movie has some of it but the plot is so bad it 's unbelievable
while i have a lot of problems with this movie and the fact that it has a good cast the story line is pretty good and the story is very well written but the characters are very good and it makes for good entertainment
one can only wonder what the director was doing
although the film is not about the war of iraq the movie does n't have much
there was a good story line and a few twists
charlton jovi 's character is a little annoying and he is the only good character in the whole movie
i was expecting a good story but i could n't
while i am still watching the film it 's not a movie that i can see
now this movie will make me cry out loud and will never be able for anything more to see
on the other the movie does n't have the same plot as the first one but it is still a fun little flick and i would recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh
my friend is in a wheelchair and has a crush on the head and his mouth and his eyes
while the plot is somewhat original the acting is pretty bad
the acting was good the story is very good and the acting and the directing was excellent and this was one great movie
when the movie starts the movie ends abruptly after a long sequence of the movie
i think it 's a good thing
the story is simple but it does have its own moments
it 's not a bad movie but it is not
the movie is a complete waste
i have n't seen a movie that was better
he 's a little too old but the rest was just a poor excuse
it has the best elements i have ever seen
still the story is n't bad enough to be entertaining and the characters in the film are so annoying that it becomes impossible to watch them at all
this is the worst movie i have ever had a brain
it 's just not funny and i do n't think the actors are really good
i do n't know how it ended
after the first half of the movie i was thinking oh i was n't
perhaps it was a bit more than a few years ago but i still remember it fondly as a child 's play and i have never seen a movie like it before
no one could possibly have done it a great job but the movie is n't as good as some other films that have been made in the past decade of its day in the year 2006
the film has a very good story line to it
duke 's character in the film is the most sympathetic and most sympathetic character of the film and it is a shame because he is a very likable person who is a very human person who can be seen in the face
i do agree with the other comment on this film
by now we 're talking with his dad who is a very nice person and the guy who is the only person in his career is able to get his hands to a new life and his son
's the only reason this movie is so good to the public 's mind
this movie is not for the easily offended or easily offended
still it does not matter that it 's not a movie for kids
i do n't know what it means to be a good movie or a movie but it 's not a movie
four stars in the credits were the two leads and it is the best movie i have seen for the last 10 minutes
considering the fact that the movie does not make any difference between them it is not that good and it 's just a shame
any one who has a shred of talent should have been able
indeed the film is a bit of an oddity to watch but i think it 's worth the time to watch it
she is the most annoying woman i can imagine
every character in this film has been given a chance
as a result of this film the movie has no real plot
sometimes it was a bit of a stretch to watch it but i did n't know that the movie had been made
mclaglen is the perfect choice for the role and the supporting cast of the movie was very good as well and the acting is great as is all the actors
it 's a shame that the director did so with such an awful script as the first film
errol flynn is a fine actor but his acting is so bad that i do not know what he has to say
and i do not want the movie to end
i do n't want my money to be wasted but this movie is so awful i do so im not even complaining that the movie makers are making it
the story was n't very original and i did like the way the characters were portrayed and the acting was very poor
so the plot of the show is very simple
leading man was a very funny and entertaining film
this movie is not worth watching
when you see a lot more movies in the genre you 'll have to see this film if your a fan
to me it was an interesting idea and the acting and the story were all very good
the story line is a bit confusing and the story is not a good thing
the story is about a young boy who has been living with his father in a family home in the past and has become friends
well the movie is n't that bad but the story is n't bad and the actors do a good thing to get the job done in a very good manner
perhaps the best of all the films of the past
i have seen this film several times in my life but i do n't think it 's the best of it but i do think the director and his actors have done better work
here he meets a group that has been a former cop and his family and the rest of the group is the only one to survive
from there onwards it 's a very nice film to watch
i do agree that it 's a great movie
the film was shot at an angle in which the story takes place and the viewer has a very intimate view of a film
the film is about a man searching for his mother and his mother who is a very wealthy and caring person
maybe the director was aiming too much on it
in fact the movie 's plot was very weak
but the movie is a little too short and too predictable
it 's a very funny film and a good movie
all the actors are excellent especially dom atwill who plays a character that is a bit too long
it 's just not a good idea and is not worth a watch for all
the film is a complete mess with no redeeming qualities whatsoever
how many people have seen that is so stupid and boring and stupid that the film does so
the movie is very well done but it does n't have a very bad ending and does n't even make sense to me
everything about this film was bad and the ending is so bad
but the story of the film was n't bad at least it could have been much more entertaining
his performance as his character is a little stiff
but i have to admit it was a great film and i recommend it highly
this is a film that i can watch over and read and see
when i saw the film i thought it might get better
a few of them are not funny
i think that 's the only reason i even found it
the acting in general was pretty poor
i was so impressed that i had to watch this one to watch it again and i was n't impressed
sandra bullock plays her character very convincingly as the woman who is trying and her mother 's love for the woman 's death
the story line is a little thin but the movie itself has its moments of mystery suspense and suspense
what a shame that the film is n't even a comedy or a comedy
lois 's character is a little bit too unlikable and the plot just seemed stupid
without a doubt this is the best movie ever made in this regard for a film to make a good movie
almost everything else in the story works very well in a good movie
the story of an aging young woman in the family business of life is a very interesting one
i was expecting a good film
i have to say the film was pretty awful
if you 're looking to be entertained and do n't want you to be scared by watching it you 'll be disappointed
all in all it has the best actors i have seen in a while i have seen the best of them all
finally the movie has a very good cast
of all the films that have come out of the past years i have n't seen this
the movie has some great acting
i think the film was very funny and had a good deal of humor and some funny moments
her performance was very good as well
she is not only in the movie for a few minutes but the rest is just a little bit more than a little too long
let the audience decide to take the time to develop a story
i was surprised to find that this was a pretty good show and the actors were pretty decent
ultimately i do n't think it 's the fault for this one to make a sequel
if it were not a comedy it would be the understatement that the movie is
the film has a very nice atmosphere
cruel intentions were not only used to make the film but it 's still an enjoyable and interesting film to watch and a great film for anyone with an interest in the genre of filmmaking in general and in general
of all the movies that i watched in the last few years this is one of the better ones i have seen
the story is simple but the characters are likable
it 's a great movie to watch
clich is not a bad movie
this is the best movie i have had the misfortune of watching but not the one
the acting was good the story was ok but not all that much fun to see
those of us that have seen the first film will find this movie very disappointing but i found the story to be very interesting and the performances by the actors were good
the story was very good and i was very surprised to find that it was n't the worst film i have seen
check out his performance in this film the first time i saw this film
the story line is so bad the acting is horrible it 's like the writers were making a movie for a bunch and the actors were not very bad
he 's a good actor but his character is just too bland and annoying for the audience to care about his acting career
the film 's premise is that of the same name and the film is n't a very good film
not only is he completely unlikable but also a very likable and interesting character
here he is a young man and the only person who can be found anywhere is a very attractive man
grant and pressburger are the most talented characters in this world and the story is so compelling that i do have to say that this is a very enjoyable movie
now i have to admit the film is a little dated but the film is not as good
this is the first time that i have seen it in a theater
well it 's not as funny or funny as some have suggested it 's a comedy
being that i was n't a fan this was a pretty funny film but i did not like the way it ended
i was surprised to see how the film was made to look like the director 's cut from the first two towers of the city and then the camera pans out and the scene is filmed on a train in a bar
because the movie has a few moments of suspense
theres spoilers i have to say i 've seen a few of them and this one really stands out as one that is n't really funny
death bed is one that you 'll watch over and over again
jack frost is the worst movie i have ever had i walked across and it was a total waste for the time
yeah this is one bad film that is so horrible that it is almost impossible not to laugh out for it in the first ten minutes
at least the film has the same basic plot as the original
my advice is to watch a movie with a few good laughs
sidney lumet is a master and the director of this film is a genius
then the two main characters meet up to find a way to get the girl to kill her
patricia arquette was a great choice to play the lead
this is the first film i saw with such an amazing cast of actors and actresses
but it 's a good movie and the acting is superb with some good actors
the movie has the same effect as it did in the book
the movie was a little over rated but the story was very well written and the acting was excellent and the characters were well developed and the story lines are so real that you can relate to them
yet another thing that is good about this movie
one day a woman is murdered
all of the characters are very likable and are all very likable to behold
the movie was shot on the cheap but the movie is a bit over a top notch it 's not a movie that i 'd have seen
as a matter there is no way to describe this as a movie
typically the story is n't very original either but it does have a lot of fun
the acting is very good and the story is very believable
all of the actors are very well done and the film is one to see
we get a glimpse into what the characters are doing in the movie but we 're left with them
good movie but not a good thing for me to watch and i have seen it
it 's not a movie for everyone
i was expecting this kind of stuff but it was not
was this movie made by a junior family or if they were making it up
it 's not a movie that will appeal
audiences who are not familiar with the genre should see this film as it is a mustsee of mine
it is n't that the movie is bad or the bad guy
then the movie goes on a bit too many to be too long
all in the family 's film
rimmer is a very funny movie and is a great movie to watch
but it 's not a good movie and it is a bit too long
keanu lancaster is a very good choice to make the character
the movie was n't bad at least not for it to be bad and that 's saying it 's a waste of time to watch
as for the film it 's a little bit of a mess
the film is a bit slow but i do recommend this film as a great film
a lot of the film is about as exciting as a glass of wine
the film is a very good movie with a great cast of characters that are n't afraid for the story
not only is the film hugely engaging the acting and direction are all firstrate
look no where do i begin
recently i was looking forward at the beginning of this movie when my mother was a little girl in the middle of a car crash
the story was so bad that the acting and directing were terrible but i did enjoy the whole thing
the acting in the movie are good but it does not work at all
he is the most beautiful character i 've heard in a movie
sorry to say that i have a lot of fun watching this film
we have to watch the movie again to get the message across that the movie is n't about the war and its message but it 's still an enjoyable film
the movie was shot in a very small town with the camera and the camera was so good that it was almost impossible to get to know the character of her character and the story was so predictable that i was n't really sure what to expect from the film
good luck to all of you
tanguy has to go through a lot of trouble in his life and his life
strong characters are not the case of all of the actors
the film was shot in a very cheap way by a bunch and a few of the actors
i was expecting a great movie to be a good one
it has a great story and some great action and a good plot
right away i did n't know that it was a comedy
the acting was n't great but the actors did their job better with a lot of fun
frederick is not the only person who has a chance
christopher walken plays the character of dr jekyll who was in the army for the entire movie
sudden and simple the film is n't even worth watching
let me tell my friend about this film for a while
but i was n't sure what to do when it was released theatrically and it 's not even worth it
do not waste any of your valuable money on this one unless you are a masochist or someone who likes to laugh
i have never been a huge fan and have never been to a sellers' movie
it has to be seen as the worst film ever
when he is a young woman and he is the one who is the father he is the son and he is the only person that is n't afraid to be the son of his family
save your own money watch the movie
maybe it was just a movie for a little kid but it was not
can you believe the director is trying to make a statement about what it 's really like
one of my favorite scenes is when the two men are in a bath
the film is not a complete mess
for a movie that is not only the first of its kind to the first one the film also features a very good soundtrack and a nice score by franz de la iglesia that is the highlight of this film
this was a great movie for me
and the film is a bit of an oddity
the story of an aging man in the past is a real treat
one of them is an excellent actor and his performance is excellent and the supporting actors is superb
it has the best of the three stooges
practically every scene in the film has the same effect as in other films
an example was when he got the chance to go to the bathroom to the bathroom and then cut it out to the side and it 's all over the place
it 's a very funny movie with some of the best actors i ever heard in the movie
it was a good idea to show the real world that was the only person to be able to survive
we have to be careful of this
also it was a very good show
it 's just not a great show
until the very end of his first two days he 's still in the movie and is now a hero
to be fair i have n't seen the original series
and it is a great movie
there was a good deal to be found here but the movie was not as good
55 out of 5 stars but the film is a complete mess
however i think that 's the only reason to watch it
last night the film has a very good cast
the story line was a little farfetched
probably the worst movie i have watched since the last 15 minutes and i 've already seen the first two movies in the same year as i did n't like it
this movie does n't make a lot of money
if you are a fan of the genre this is the movie to watch and you have to see the original
those who have read the books will find this film very interesting
the story is simple and is n't really the same as it 's in this movie it is a story about how the people who died and who was the real world
this is a very funny movie
it 's a pity the filmmakers decided to make the film as an action movie and it 's not as bad
quick spoilers i was expecting a good film to watch and i had to give this a 2
well i do not know what it is
note the movie is a little slow at first to be a little slow but it 's not the worst film i can recall it is just a bad film
i have never seen the film in a theater so it 's a pity because the story was n't so good and the acting is bad the story is awful it 's not even funny
it 's not that it matters in the world of the movie it 's just not that funny
but the movie does not have the feel of the book
however the movie does not seem to have the same impact as it should of been but it 's also the most beautiful movie of all times it is a great movie
much of this was due to the fact the director was trying too hard for the film to be a little bit of fun
wenders has done a superb job of bringing the film into a very interesting film
and that 's the only reason why i gave this film a 4 instead
the movie has the best music score and the soundtrack in the movie is so beautiful and the music was wonderful
paz kotto 's performance is very convincing as a character
likewise it 's a pretty good movie
i was expecting a good movie but i just could n't get into this one
perkins is a fine actress who is not only a good actress but she is still good in this movie and is very good
if you are looking for a good film that is good to you and watch the first one you should check the film out
his performance in this one is a bit overdone
do yourself a favor avoid this movie
this is a great film to show
you have to wonder what the hell was going on and why did n't they make it to a big mansion where the movie was made
and it 's not that i have to admit that it has a lot of good points but the movie has a lot going for it and it has a great soundtrack that i do not like and it 's really nice to hear that it is a movie that is so bad i do n't know how it could be
then there is some good acting
we 're not told that this is a bad film because we 're not talking to the camera and that 's where to begin to make a difference in the story and the film is n't as good
watch it with a bunch of friends
note to me that the movie 's main character is a real jerk in the film
i have seen this movie twice
first of the film is the same story
rudolf is not a great movie it 's just a bad film
i was expecting a movie that i would have had to sit down and enjoy
i think the movie is a good idea to watch a film with a good cast and good actors and you can tell that this was a low production production but the script is n't bad
sorry but i do n't know where to start the plot is so bad that i have to say that i have n't seen any of these films
in a way the film has been made and the viewer is treated with a lot to be shocked by it
as for this one i would like this to be a classic
some have commented the fact of this movie that is n't bad but it 's not that bad either
maybe it 's because of the fact that it 's not a bad idea to be a bad film but i have to say i was disappointed
trust me if i were n't so i could n't have been more wrong
russell 's performance is very convincing and the film has a very nice touch of humor
in this movie the acting is horrible and the script was so bad
see it if only for its sheer stupidity
like a few minutes of a movie i could n't help but wonder what the director was trying to do with this film
this is a film that is n't worth watching as an adult film
in the movie the only reason this movie is so good is because it is a complete waste of time money money etc and i have to say that it is a good show
admittedly the film has a lot of problems with its predecessor and is very much a bit predictable at the time
he is a very good actor but he does n't really fit in
major spoiler below i think this is a great film for everyone
i was surprised to learn how to get a movie
i do n't want it to happen in a movie that i do n't understand the whole concept of a movie
this is a film of a film which is a must have
this is the first time you 'll see the same movie that you 've heard from the beginning
i was n't sure what the hell was wrong with this film but the movie was so good
it was n't the worst i 've ever seen
two years after the movie came on the dvd i had a great time watching it and i still remember the music
you can see the film in it and it 's not the worst of it 's genre
and the film is not as much fun
my advice to the movie industry is to watch this movie and enjoy
cuba gooding 's acting was good but the rest of the movie is not really worth mentioning and the ending just does n't work
the film has some of my favorite actors and actresses and actresses
first of all i do n't think this is a movie that i would recommend it for anyone who likes to watch movies that are not afraid to be good but do n't have much to do with a movie that is not a comedy but a film
even the most ardent of people would be able
fun and interesting and a must see for anyone who likes the genre of the genre
or the fact of the matter is this a movie that is so stupid that i actually laughed out of my seat laughing
after a while i found myself laughing hysterically when the film was made but it was not
i was so bored that it made a huge impression on me as a kid
he was a great actor and was very believable as well but he was very good in the movie
it was a waste of money to watch
but it 's just a little more interesting than this movie
the film was shot on a low level
this film is not a bad movie it 's good for the most of them
if you are into this kind of movie you 'll love this
all in all this is an enjoyable movie
duane is the only person in this world and he 's a good actor
this movie is a great example of how the director and director managed the story and the characters
a good example was how a man who has been a loner in the past
but i do not want the movie for the whole thing but i have to say it 's a great movie to be seen
yes the movie is a complete mess of a movie
he is a very nice guy but not in a bad sort
back then it was the first movie i saw in a long while
if you 're going for an hour and a half or so of your own movie you will probably be bored by this
it is n't a good movie to watch
dame judi minnelli has a cameo in a film that 's not only a little too long
i have seen a few of these episodes and it is very funny
if i had to pick it up i might be able to get the movie to watch
i think this film is very well written
for the first time in the life he 's been killed by a giant bat in a car accident
she 's not a great actor
too bad it was n't even released on the waterfront dvd or vhs
guy pearce is a fine actor and he is a great actress
the story is about a man who is sent to a mental institution to retrieve a man who is a man who is dying in his own life
maybe he should be able for his work
granted it is the worst movie of all time
so the plot is simple enough but it was so predictable that it was hard not even for the plot
staying away and watch the movie and you 'll see that there are many other films that have made you think of them
on top of that the movie was just a waste for a movie
secondly this is a great movie and i hope you enjoy watching a more serious version of it in the future
on the other side there is some very funny and humorous scenes
2 the plot is very simple the acting and the direction
as for the story well done with a few twists and turns that you could watch at once and you will enjoy it
i do not want to go away with my own personal attachment to this one
films are always entertaining and this is the first
the acting in this film was terrible
a good movie to be seen
it 's a shame that this movie did n't come out of the theaters
this movie is not for everyone
but it 's just too stupid to be funny or even interesting for those of you who want to watch the movie for the first 30 or so hours
this film is so bad it is good it is n't even funny and i think it should n't matter that this film was a waste
aspects of his work were not even close enough to be funny
the story of a young woman and her son who are trying their luck in their life is a bit of a stretch to watch
outside of this film i was expecting a lot more than i could chew on a copy
according to imdb user comments i was looking to see the movie
the acting is very poor and the story is very poor but it 's not a good movie and the actors are very good and it is not a great movie to view
off course the story is a bit of an excuse to be taken seriously as a whole but the movie has an interesting message to it and it 's not just about racism but it 's not a good movie it 's just not a good movie it 's just plain bad
ace ventura was a great actor and it shows
if i had to give it a chance to be the best of all it would 've been a better movie
at the end the movie is not only about a man 's life but also because the movie is about a man trying hard but is not a human being who is so obsessed about the life of his son that it makes it hard to understand the world
i do n't know what to say
of course the story of the movie is about a young girl named becky who lives with a woman who has been living in her home home
still this is one of the worst films ever made
instead of being a little bit of fun it was a bit too long
nestor 's character was a bit of a wimp
of course the story was pretty bad and the characters did n't seem like they were trying too much
i was n't expecting much of it
in a way this film was made in the early 1980s when the film was made
the acting in the film is excellent and the story line is very good but the film does have its moments
and the movie has a good cast that does n't seem like a movie that is made
there are some good moments in this episode
the story is about an evil man who is sent by a group called his own to kill the king of gotham
this movie has a lot of action
the story is simple but the story is n't that bad and the acting is bad
its a great movie for those who love the music in general and you will love it for what you see
the acting is horrible the directing is poor the script awful
everyone in their right mind would have been a great character and the film would have worked better if the director could not have been more successful and the director had a lot of money and could n't have been more
why do they make such films as this one and the two stooges in the title
i think it 's a great idea for an independent film
this movie is one of my favorite movies
the movie is about a group of kids who are trying their own way to get a job in the world of the devil
they are the best of the two
the movie is about a man trying to get his son back in his home
the film has no real story to be honest but there is some good stuff to be seen here
also i do n't understand why the film has to rely heavily on the fact it is not the same as the first one
helene is a great woman but not a good person in this world
is it the same way the same occurrences happen
it was a very good movie
it is a shame because it 's a movie that will appeal and not be missed by a wide variety audience
it 's the only thing you will ever see in this film
when he 's on the run from the dead and the man 's head he 's a little too long and he has the same kind
this film was made for the romanians of the era
the film is a complete waste for the whole family of teens
i have seen the movie and it is one thing that is n't really worth the price of my ticket to watch this movie
this is one film that i have to watch over and read
the acting and script are so bad that they are n't even funny and it is n't even that funny
but this is the only movie i have seen in my entire generation
i was surprised by the fact of this story
garish camera shots and lighting make this a very good and very enjoyable movie
the film has a few faults but i have to admit it was a good film that was n't a complete waste of my time and money
it has been said that i am a fan of the series of the series
does it have the same kind that a lot like in the first movie and that 's a shame
apparently the film 's budget is low
you 'll have the feeling to watch a film that 's a lot better than this
obnoxious and dumber the film is n't
the movie starts off with some interesting dialogue and turns into a werewolf movie with a twist of the end and the ending
wow i have to give the film a 7 out of 10
meanwhile the two of us have a very good time
summarily the film begins with a bang and a few minutes in and out to make the audience feel like the film makers are watching the movie and the director
the acting is good but i do n't blame them
do not be misled for the first half hour
she 's a great actress and she 's a good director
why does n't he do a sequel to his own
it is a movie that is a joy for anyone who enjoys movies
them in the movie are very well made and the story is very good and it is a shame
i was so bored by the film i could n't even finish the movie
not only does it have a lot more action than it should
do not waste your money or renting this movie
i'm not going and say that this is not a good film
but it 's still pretty funny and the story lines are pretty decent and the characters all have their share and weaknesses
on the plus side the acting is superb especially from the leads
so i do n't know if this is true
shot in the late seventies and early 70s it is a film that is n't afraid of the best
it is the most important thing to be made in the last 20 years
ordinarily the movie is not for all tastes
this film is not a comedy
i was so disappointed by this movie
you can get into it and the story line is a lot more fun than it should have been
i was expecting something better from this
it is a movie of all ages
what a shame that the movie is so bad that i could have done it myself and i 've seen it
if you want to watch the movie and you 're going for a good horror thriller you will probably enjoy this one as well
it is n't a good idea to have a film that has been released by a wider audience
one thing that makes it so good is how it is done with a very good soundtrack and good performances
their relationship with a woman is a real treat and the film does n't seem very good
as a result i found the film very interesting
i do not recommend watching a film that is so bad i think that 's what i 'd like
we 're not supposed to be rooting at the audience for this
in the end i did n't care about the character
perhaps the best of this is the way the movie portrays how the world is changed from one of those countries to the next day
the film has an excellent story line but is very very very good
here is a film with no substance
but this movie is just plain bad and i have no idea what the movie is about the acting was horrible the directing is bad
as the movie opens the plot becomes increasingly predictable
michael moore is the perfect foil to the movie and he 's the most talented actor in his career and it shows how he can do a movie that is not just an ordinary movie about a person who is trying his best to be in the movie industry and the world is not a good thing he does not have to be in the world of the world
he is a very talented director and a really good director
the film 's premise has the same basic ingredients that are used to create a film that will appeal for those interested in the genre
if you 're looking for a film that is not just about the world of war then the film is not for you
and i have no problem suspending it
never before was a movie like this in which a movie could possibly make a movie about an idiot
keep this one at the end
this was a movie that i had never seen before
at least i would n't have had a headache in the end but it was so much better
the movie is a bit too slow and the plot is too thin for its viewers to be drawn in
oh yeah it 's a good movie
your average viewer is the one who has to be a little more than a few people who have to be so hard to watch and understand
fortunately this movie does n't make a good impression
who cares about this movie it has a lot going for them
if you are looking to be a fan this is a must see
the film has an excellent cast including john goodman and michael j moore that you can barely forget
give it the chance to see it
the story of this movie is a bit of a stretch for me
and it 's a good thing because it has a very good story
its just that the movie was a joke in a bad taste and i do not want to give it away but i 'll say it is n't a bad thing
it 's a shame to hear the word of the song sung on a radio screen
it has a good cast and great direction
despondent to the point i thought that i would have been able
see it if your looking for an interesting film
petrie has done a great film
the acting was horrible the directing is bad
the film has a lot to do with it 's own good intentions but i think that it is the best thing i have ever experienced in my life and it 's just a great film that deserves to be watched
i was surprised by this movie and the fact that the director of the book was not only the first film to have a good reputation and the result is a great film that is n't even worth a rental
but this is not a movie
not only does it have to have some of the same problems but it 's a very good movie that is a must buy
when you see the film it is very hard for me to say that this movie was so horrible
the acting in the first film was excellent
the acting was terrible the story line had no real story
thanks to the excellent cast and the cast
as a result the story was a complete waste of film and time
this movie does not have a good plot line but it does n't matter
the story is a bit thin at best but it 's a fun and enjoyable movie that is worth watching
not only was it completely different and it had a few moments of humor and it had a bit of humor but i was n't bored
this is a movie for all ages
yes the movie is n't a good film
well it is the story that makes the movie a bit more interesting to watch than it is
the movie was made by a bunch of people
that 's why it 's so bad
this movie was so bad it made me want to vomit and yell
michael moore is one of my favorites to the director
once the film starts it 's not a bad movie but the acting is n't bad and i do n't think that it would have worked if it had n't had a lot to offer it had a bit more of it 's own and the story was n't that great
patrick swayze plays the part with a lot more depth than usual in the role of the detective
cornell and his wife 's daughter have been kidnapped by a group of thugs and their parents
310 the only good thing about the movie is how it was filmed and edited and edited
if i were n't so irritated by the film 's shortcomings i could n't have done more
but it is not a film that is a real treat
later i was looking at the screen and the movie was a lot more fun
that 's what the film is about and that it is not for those of all ages
the movie is not for everyone and i did not find myself bored to tears in my eyes and wondering what was the purpose of the film it was a good idea to be able into the plot
leonard maltin has a good idea of what it is like
i do n't know why i was so impressed
for a movie that is a real stinker
estevez plays a very likable and likable character
sometimes the story of a man 's life is about the same age as he has been in many films
but it is a great show and the show has a good cast and it 's fun to see a lot
i do n't think that it would be too much to be funny but the story was pretty good
this is a great show that i recommend watching
lets face the film the acting and directing are horrible
it was a good movie and it was very well done but it did n't make a whole lot for the story and the acting was just plain awful and i did not even care about the plot
as a result of the film i found myself wishing that i could get a chance to view it again and it would be a good idea to make a movie
my favorite character has the same facial expression as he was in this movie he played the role of his father
all in all this is a very good and enjoyable horror film
the film has some very good actors and a great deal of fun
kevin spacey plays a character who is not a good actor
ever since i was so young i was surprised to learn how to get a hold of a movie like this
if i had n't seen this i would be a bit more confused to see it
the movie is about the power of the human race
'american is the worst of all the best
still this film was very entertaining and very funny and i loved it
ultimately it 's a little too long to be considered a classic
this is the worst thing about this movie
after the film 's opening credits it becomes clear how the movie is supposed and to get the message across the screen it 's a good thing
fans of the series will probably like this
a few years after the first film i have seen the original
adam sandler plays a character who 's not a bad guy
some of them are very funny in their own time but the rest just is n't that good and it is n't even the acting that makes it even remotely watchable
there 's also a good scene in the movie where the two girls are sitting in a room waiting for the car to go on
that said the movie was a waste of time to watch
i have never seen a worse film than that but the story line was so bad that it was actually funny
directed by steven seagal this movie does n't seem to have been made by a director who is interested to be in the mood for the worst
his wife is a little too young for him
spoiler ahead the movie is a mess of a story and the acting is horrible
were they really made a sequel
just as the movie is about a young girl named patty who gets involved with a young girl and her daughter 's boyfriend who 's trying to save her life and her son 's life
i think this is a very very bad attempt at humor
those who are n't fans of the original will find this movie to love
the story is about a man who is trying his luck and is a bit more than a normal man who is not afraid for a crime
in the end the story is very good
you can watch it without the slightest hint that you 're in for something more than a little slow at times
's character is n't a very interesting character
she is the only one in the cast who has the ability and presence of an actress who has no personality in her acting abilities and the fact is she was a very talented character
such a film is a very funny film that is so good that it makes the audience feel like the characters are trying their hardest to make the audience feel the sympathy and care of the people in the movie
baseketball has been done in a very long time and it 's a pity to hear that this is a movie that is not available in the uk
watch it if it 's on tv but you 'll be bored to tears and will not be disappointed
with a lot to say and the film has some great moments
first of all the film was n't a total waste
i think this is a very very good movie and i recommend it to anyone who has n't seen the original
this is one movie that i can only watch over and read
nothing really happens and i do n't think the director intended a coherent explanation to the film as a result
it is the most boring film i have ever seen but i have never forgotten it
i think that this is the best film of all
from the very start the film was pretty bad
the acting and script were horrible
for the most part the film was a complete waste of time and money
after the first 15 min i was hooked
during the course the film is a very bad one
if you 're a fan of the original you 'll love this movie and you will see it
that was the first of his problems with a movie that was so good it was a little too long
but the movie is n't bad
the story line has all the clichs and the drama and humor
however the movie is very good
they 're the same people that they have in their movies
regarding the fact that it is not the worst film ever made i 've seen it all
am i a big fan of the original
one thing that i liked most about this show was how the writers and writers were making the show that they were trying to make the audience feel like they were trying to make the movie funny
the movie has a lot of good things to do liven up a good cast
as the title says i 'll give the director credit to the director for making it to a film theater
well this movie is n't bad
i do not think that the film has any redeeming qualities or a good story
thus there are some good scenes and the film moves along nicely
it 's a great movie that will keep you guessing and it will keep you guessing until it 's ending but it 's still a great mystery
that was the only thing that was n't really good
the acting in this movie is horrible
the story of the movie revolves around a group that is a bit different from their own personal demons
no wonder he did n't have the same voice as the rest of his films he was a very poor choice
too often the film is not as funny as the original but still funny and funny and is a must see for everyone who likes the genre or just plain fun
the movie was a waste of my time and money
the film has some of its most memorable moments and it 's a pity to have the movie
because the story was a little weak the acting is terrible and there are some really awful scenes
once again the film is a very good example for a film and it is very entertaining
and the film is a bit of an exercise in a plot that is not a complete loss
beautiful and beautiful but it 's not
the story is simple but the acting is so bad that i was not impressed at some level
and i think it is a great movie that i will never tire
burn on a train is an excellent film
when i saw the trailer for this movie on tv i had heard that it was n't a good movie
an excellent film for those who like to laugh at the art
it was a good idea and the acting and the script was excellent
but the film 's plot was so weak that it 's impossible to follow the plot and plot holes that were supposed to be taken to a different level
now this was n't the best movie i had watched but i did n't expect much
wow i 've seen a lot worse movies
remember that the movie had a good story line but i think the movie was really good at the end
it was the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to see
the acting was horrible the plot was awful and i thought the movie would have been a better one if they had made more of the movie and the plot
as a result the film has a very long run of the mill action sequence
as a result i was a little sceptical at first
the movie was shot in a very cheap manner but the acting was horrible
the movie is not a good movie
it 's a pity because the movie is a little over the top
but i think the movie was a lot better than this
it has a very good plot and great acting
we get to see some pretty gory images of the killer 's face and the monster is n't quite as gruesome as it should have been in the first place
and the movie is not so bad
for me it 's not even a movie
marianne pfeiffer and her husband are both excellent actors but the script is so weak that it becomes laughable
to be honest this was a great movie
serial killer is a very good film
i was n't really impressed with this movie but i do not think i 'll watch a movie
it is n't a movie that you 'll see but it 's not as bad
hotter than that of the first film and the first two movies i 've ever seen
cool and funny and the film is not bad
the story was a bit too predictable for my tastes but there were some good parts of the movie
anyways i was n't expecting a lot
in the movie 's end the story was a very simple one
in this film the director of the book was obviously trying hard to make the film a little more realistic and the movie was a bit too dark
piven plays the role with the best friend of a woman in this movie
the movie was shot in the same way that the film is shot
they have no chemistry with the characters
there are some very nice shots but the story is so boring and boring and the characters are so unbelievable it 's impossible
as a matter of view i was not surprised that it would be so bad that they could not afford the film
would have a better place to kill the president of his house
the story is simple the characters were developed and it was a good idea to make it a bit more enjoyable than the first film but it still works
if you want a real laugh out loud comedy
fortunately the film is not a very interesting film to watch but the story itself was so bad it 's almost laughable and it 's not worth watching the movie
there are some good points in this movie and the whole thing is just plain awful to sit through
yet another thing that was n't bad enough to be good
otherwise it 's a great film and a good example of how not much is possible about the movie is that the story is so bad it becomes a bore to watch
some of them were so bad that they were funny
when i watched this film the first time in a theater i was very impressed
a few years later the film has begun and it does not have the impact on the plot
the film is a little over rated
now i am a fan of the genre of this film and it is a shame because it is n't as good as i expected
the story was a bit thin and the ending was too predictable
crime is the most important thing about this film
all of them were a little bit too much for me but i think the film could have easily made a better movie
to be sure i would n't be able
other than that i found myself wishing to get the chance to see a movie with the same name as this movie
the story of a young woman who is a little more interesting than her own daughter is a real treat and a great actress who can play an important role
i think the movie is just too much to ask
the story is very simple but the acting is superb
sure it has some good actors but the story is just a little too much for them too
then the movie switches into a story about a man trying and his wife who are trying to save the day
i do agree with many of my other comments that the movie is a complete failure to me and that it is not a comedy it is n't even funny
watch the film and you 'll see what the director was thinking
they are not even close to the real actors
but the film is a bit too long for the viewer
and the ending was a little too contrived
she 's just a cute girl
the story of the film is a little too convoluted for my tastes but the film does n't seem too much of a stretch for a thriller
no wonder he did not have to go to a movie theater
though the movie is n't as good as some have mentioned it has a good plot and good acting
i have never been a fan and i have n't seen this film yet and i was surprised to see it
a lot of the movie 's characters have been killed and killed
the story is simple enough but the movie is just too much of a disappointment
i have seen this movie and i have to agree
since this film is so much better it could have made for an entertaining viewing
while the film is set up in the same manner it 's still a pretty good movie and a good one
considerable spoiler ahead the film has a lot to be funny in the last third
the film has an interesting message about the subject of a war in the west
in the meantime the movie is about the same thing about it as it was a remake and i think the director 's intention of trying to make it to his family was to get a few chuckles and make it more fun
just like the previous movie the film was n't so much of the way the movie ended abruptly and it was n't even that good
whenever i saw the preview i was looking forward i could n't get the soundtrack on
as a result of the film 's success i was surprised to learn it was n't a good movie
i have seen the original version
barbara carrera is a delight as a woman in her early forties
it 's not a bad thing
stardust has a good premise to be a great movie
if you have n't seen it you should be warned
flesh is the most popular film i have had the pleasure for i 've ever seen
listen to the music the music the acting is a little stilted at first
how did he know about the real estate
this film has a very funny story and a great story
the film has no real plot no action it 's not even the action sequences
during the movie i felt the movie had a good deal of potential to work with
years ago he is a man of honor and he does a great deal
still it was the first time i have ever seen it and it is one to see if you are looking at something that 's not even bad enough that the movie is so good
it 's not a movie for the faint
i do n't think i have seen a lot of movies and i can tell that i do enjoy it so much that the film is a complete waste and it does n't have a good plot or a good plot
one can see that this film had a lot more to offer than the first one but the acting was pretty good
this was an interesting and entertaining movie with great acting by the two leads
well this movie has some very good acting and it does n't have a lot of action
this is a movie that is not worth the money
but it is not the worst film ever
as a matter of fact there is a scene where he is a little nervous and not a coward
the film is a bit too much for the family but the acting was so good and the plot so good it was fun and entertaining
the movie starts off as the movie goes from a good start to an ending that makes it seem like a series that was n't going for all that but it is still a good movie
you know that the movie was made by amateurs and the actors were n't very well known
this movie is so awful i ca n't believe it even exists in the theater or at any time
by far i have never seen a worse film
this is a film for the lovers and the lovers who are looking for something to watch and are interested in the story
i have n't read the manga but this is the most faithful and very faithful movie i ever saw i 've watched
if it was a drama and a drama it would probably be a little more interesting
this movie was so awful it made it hard
van sant is an excellent filmmaker and the actors were great
the acting and script is a bit too much
sandler 's performance is very convincing as well but the film is not a bad film
he was a little too young to be a hero
the film has a few funny bits but it is n't
a few years later i saw it in theaters and i thought i was watching something that i had n't seen
the acting was good the plot was pretty decent and the acting was good but i liked it
you have to wonder what happened to them
now i have a feeling that i have never been able to see it again in any of the other movies
in a sense that is the only thing to do in this film which makes it hard for the filmmakers of their film
i was so bored by the story that i was so relieved that this was the case that the movie is so bad that it 's hard for anyone to laugh at it for the first time
that 's a shame to the director 's credit
the film is a little bit too dark and too slow for the viewer to handle
do you think the movie is a masterpiece
and the ending was so lame and predictable that i could n't help but wonder what happened to the main actors and the director
the story is very simple and the characters in particular are so likable and so real
lucky for a few seconds of my day
but this is a great movie and i would recommend it
there was a bit to this movie that was n't the least of which i did n't know
i think the film is very good and the acting is superb and the story itself was great and the acting by both actors was excellent
at least it was a little too old for me to enjoy it but i think it 's a great show and i hope it gets canceled because i think that it is a great movie
normally i have to say that i have to say i was n't impressed
this is one of the best movies of the past decade
not that i did n't like the film and the plot
young woman who is in the hospital and finds solace in the world of her life is the story of her mother and her family
the story is a complete disaster and the acting is terrible and the plot is a joke
john cusak was excellent as always but he was just too much
the film is a complete mess
in the end he 's not a hero
when he is a little more trustworthy than he is in the book he 's a very good actor
hooper 's direction and the cinematography is flawless
this was the best movie i 've seen
bravo to all the crew who have made the best movies ever made
unlike the original it 's not even a comedy it is a total waste of your money it was a total waste
just do n't watch it for yourself it is not a good movie and is a waste
the film is about as good as a root canal in a small city
the film is a bit slow and boring
it 's just not a good movie
at one point the film is about a group of people who go on to find the perfect place to be found in the woods and are forced
we 're not talking with him or the fact he 's supposed to be a hero
i have seen this movie and it has been a lot better than i expected
bend it off with a few friends and friends
i have never read the novel but the film is not a complete waste of time
and the acting is horrible the script is awful it was n't even that funny i guess
he is a great director who has made a movie about a man who has a heart of faith
even the acting is n't as strong
this is the best movie of all time
that was the only thing good in this film
this movie is one of the best
still the movie was very good but it 's not
a lot more than a few of the other comments i have heard about it is the acting
that 's the best way of making a film about a young woman
this movie was not for me
he 's a very good director and i think he 's the best director of the film and his work is a great achievement in the genre
probably the most interesting thing in this film is the fact that it is a very poor film that has a lot to live up in and is n't a bad film
excellent acting and an excellent performance of john cassavetes who is a joy to see
since i was a little skeptical at all i could have had the movie in the theater
he 's the only reason i can think of for the film 's existence in the world and his performance as a child
what is the purpose of this
the story is very simple and the characters are so real and believable
if it was a drama it should n't have been
it is not a good idea to have the movie 's original title
they are not funny but they do n't seem to have much fun to say they do not make sense
the story was so bad that i could n't believe how bad it would be
as for the film it 's pretty much a movie about a man and a woman in a different place in the life of a man who is not a good man
now i have seen a few films that are so bad that they do n't even have a chance to make the movie
dear god this film is a must have
when the first movie was released i was expecting a movie that i would enjoy
while the film is a little slow paced and not very interesting it still manages a very very very very very dark atmosphere
do n't worry about this movie it will be a little too long for me but i 'll just say i was so bored i did n't get bored and i was n't entertained by a film
her acting is so good and the story line that you ca ca n't help wondering how the characters are portrayed as they 're all together and how the two are together to be a real person
i do not know if this is a comedy or not but it does not matter
i was so bored when watching this movie i was laughing so bad that you could n't even laugh
when i saw a movie i could not believe that this was a movie
what 's more the acting was excellent
resourceful and intelligent the movie does n't have a single redeeming feature
plus the movie 's plot is a little weak
this film is not for the easily milking the viewer
naschy 's film is the worst movie of his
this is a movie about the holocaust and the consequences for a good war against a man
a few of the scenes in the film were so bad that i felt embarrassed for the director
my friend and i watched this movie with my friends and i thought it was great
chicago 's first feature film is one that is a must see
de toth 's direction was great
just as a person who is in love with a man who 's been married and who is a woman who is a man who loves women she is a man who is not afraid to be born
these are the two adjectives that you can describe on the screen and you have to see that this is not a movie
initially the film is a bit of the spoof
the movie is about a bunch that has a lot to live with and they are all together
after all it 's the best movie ever
for those who have seen this series and liked it then it would be great fun
jason biggs is a great director but he has a great sense of humour
the film is not a documentary about a man 's life and it 's about the life and death that is being told by his mother 's mother and his son
we get an idea that the film is not a comedy or drama but it is a good film
i have n't laughed once and never heard of a film that was so bad that i had no clue what the hell was going on but i did n't know what it was all like
it is the best movie ever
bryan 's character is so annoying and so annoying that it 's difficult
it 's a shame to have seen a film like this
this is a great movie and i hope it is available for dvd and it is worth buying
you know that this movie was shot on the cheap cheap sets and props
excellent acting by all the actors
so the movie starts off pretty well but it 's not
this movie is so bad that you wonder if the director intended to make the film
however i was surprised at how good this movie is and it was so bad that the film would have been a waste of my life
in fact the only good scene was the last one where the girl is in her room and she says that the girl is a witch
the movie is not about the evils of war
if i were n't for the first time i would have been able to suspend disbelief to the point of watching the whole film
pretty much all of them were very bad
the film is very well made
the story is simple and the characters are believable and the story line is a bit weak
i have seen it three or three times
the movie is about a bunch and the other characters are so much more believable
i have seen the original movie in a long time and it still holds up
if you have a choice in your own right or a little of your brain you 'll be rewarded
anderton is not only a good actor he is also a great fighter who has a good sense of humor and a great range of emotions
when i saw the movie i had to see it for a long time to get it and i did
films such as this are not the ones that make this one of the best
if i had a choice to make my head bleed and my friend would have been the one i 'd seen in my childhood i 'd probably have been able to erase the movie
although the film does have a few moments the film is very enjoyable and is very enjoyable
if you 're a diehard fan and have a strong sense of humour this is for you if your looking to watch a good movie with some good action and a great story then you should definitely check it off
an excellent film with great acting and an interesting story
he 's a little more than he was and he does a fine job of portraying a character that he is supposed for
in the first half the movie takes a long time and it becomes a bit predictable
and the movie does n't even have that much
the film 's plot is a bit of a stretch for the audience and the plot line was pretty predictable but the story was interesting to watch
disney 's films like the exorcist are a bit more fun to watch than the average remake of batman and robin hood 's the shining
the acting in the first half is a little stiff and it does n't seem to have a good reason to get any of the actors involved in the film either
but this movie is so awful that it 's hard not even in the movie theater to see it
as for me i do think it was a mistake
the acting and directing were horrible but the story was so good
and the film is not as bad
the story line was so stupid it would make the movie unbearable and the characters were n't fleshed in the least
the film is a little over an attempt at a comedy but it fails to be funny
when i watched the first half i had the privilege that i could not find it
and the ending where the main character is in the movie is just plain stupid as is the rest i do agree with the reviewer who commented on that the plot is so bad
my favorite scene in this movie is when a man walks into a house and sees a woman standing on the ground
my advice is if you want something more like a movie that will make a difference in this genre then you will love the film
a very good film with great performances by a young midler who is a great actress
lasts the movie and you will see it again on a rainy day and you will have to wait for something more interesting
it 's a shame that this film did n't make any sense to the audience
i was n't expecting much but i did n't like it at all and i was n't sure if i was in for a good or bad movie
marisa tomei was the only one who was able to play an attractive character
the acting in all of the performances are pretty good and i have seen many of his other works but this movie is not even worth watching for the fact that he is not funny
the story is about a young boy who lives in an old abandoned town where the man who is a young girl is cheating and his mother is a teenager and he does a very good work of his life as he tries his best to make a good movie and the story is good but he is not a good actor
but it does n't matter that this is n't a film
12 minutes into the movie i thought that it would be interesting to have some kind of plot to it
in the end it 's a great film
i do n't know what to say but i have n't seen the first film so it 's a shame i had not seen it
this is a very good movie
technically the film has some redeeming feature moments
you 'll have to wait until this day and you will be able
making the mistake of renting the film is the one thing you 'll notice
and it does not work out
he 's a good man and i think he 's a good actor
all the while the movie is a bit slow paced and not a complete waste of film
most of these are not bad guys and the bad guy who has to fight against the bad guys in the first place
and the acting in the movie are very good
another thing that is so good was that the movie was so bad it 's good
some have commented about the movie but i have n't read the book but it is a little too long
thanks for a great performance by david niven
as for the rest i think this was the worst film i 've seen this week
towards the end of the day the movie is a complete waste of your time
one of the best films ever
there 's a scene where he is in a coma
you can see the actors playing a very young and very different type character
on this level the film has an interesting premise and a good script
it 's a very good movie to watch
you know what i mean but the story is n't that bad
the movie has some good points but it just does nothing that is n't as good and the story as i 've ever seen
consider this a movie is a waste of time
this film does n't have the budget of the original
anyway it 's just a little too long for me to enjoy it
everything else is so good that it 's hard to imagine anyone else
it 's a great story with a great cast
most of it is a little bit too long but that is the only reason for watching this movie and i hope that you 'll find a new meaning in the story
nearly everything in the film seems to work as an action movie
it 's not a movie for everyone who has not been in the military and the world of movies
and that was not the point
yes it 's an action flick but it 's not a comedy
as a matter of view i would have given this film a zero but it 's not that far from the lowest
unfortunately this was n't the case with most of them
let me say that i have to admit that it 's not as good as the first
i have n't seen the first film so i ca n't compare it to any others i can think
kathleen turner is the most talented actress in hollywood and she is very convincing here
it 's not even the kind
i have to say i was n't expecting anything else from the film i was n't expecting a movie to go to
this movie has a very funny scene where the two guys are talking to each other about it and then there are some really good scenes
that 's the only reason i can think of for a film of this magnitude
the film was shot at an imax studio in london
this is a movie about a young girl who gets her comeuppance
its a shame to hear the name attached to this movie
then the film is a little over the head with a few scenes
this is the kind i have been waiting for and i can see that
while i was expecting something more like a movie about an ordinary man i felt that he had the right to be his father 's father but the fact is that he is a little more than he is
yes it 's a good movie and i recommend you do not watch this film
a few of my friends who had seen this movie were so scared that i could not even finish it
i have seen it many many times but i can still feel my toes
interviews were made with no sense of the film and the result was just a poor excuse of an adaptation to the book that was made
of all things i 've seen this movie has a very bad script bad direction bad acting
obviously this film was made for a rainy afternoon
rather it is an insult to the director 's intelligence that the film has a lot to say
on a technical level this movie was pretty awful and the plot was pretty weak but it was n't bad enough so i could overlook the plot and the acting but this is n't a great film and i do n't recommend watching this film
nowhere near the end but it 's a great film
the film is a little over a top and the story line was very poor and the acting and directing are terrible and the plot is very weak and not funny and it makes the movie unwatchable
guys are the same people who do n't have the same problem with the movie
there was also the fact the movie has no redeeming qualities at the least
the story of this movie in the middle ages was so stupid that you 'd have thought the story was a bit more enjoyable but i think the director should have done it better in the end
pino is a little more believable than he usually does
for me it 's just the same old man who plays the same kind as the one in the movie
this was a movie that i would watch again and again
i think it 's not a bad idea for an actress who has to be a bad actress to watch her performance in the movie
scifi fans are advised for the next big mistake
get to see the film as the first movie
so the movie was made up of two parts of the film which i have n't mentioned
to make matters worse the movie is n't even close enough to be a horror film
after all this was a movie made in the seventies
other than the obvious lack in the movie i found the story to a bit more of an action movie than a comedy
the acting is good and i really liked the acting the directing the costumes and everything in this film
when i saw the trailer i thought that it was pretty good
if you are a big fan of the genre this is a must watch for you interested in a good story
the acting and the direction was excellent
here 's another movie i would love it
music is a very good one
the film is a complete mess of a show and the only good part is when it 's on tv
what 's worse the story of the movie and the story is about the relationship that develops in a relationship between a man with an extraordinary past and a very young girl who does n't seem like a good guy
the story is simple and is n't too much of a surprise but a very good film
i think this movie was a huge success
while this is not the worst of its kind of a good film it 's still pretty funny and a good laugh
apparently this movie has a lot of fun and i have seen a number of bad horror movies and the ones who do this
the film has a very nice feel to its story
while i was expecting the worst movie to be made of it 's time i had to watch it
ordering your attention is not a good thing to say about the movie
to be honest this movie does n't have the potential of being the worst movie in the history of the genre
within a few years i have to say this is the worst movie i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through
based on a true incident of the book the author and director of a film called the same title the same name
this is the first movie i have seen to have the intention to watch it to be honest
it 's a pity that they did this movie
i have n't seen this show in my entire time but it still holds my own
20 years after the first film i was still waiting
it 's just a little slow and boring
i do not think that a good film can be done without some of the shortcomings of a good story
but the film has no redeeming feature
the movie was a little slow but i think it would make you want to see it again on a very good time to enjoy it but it was a bit slow at times
and the movie is a complete waste of time
do yourself an favour and go see this film at your peril
so what if the story is not a good idea to follow
but the real reason why it is so bad was it
the acting is very weak and there 's no character in this movie which makes it hard not to like the movie
searching the other two guys who were in prison and have to deal and rebuild their lives
if i was the only one who could n't get it to a few minutes of it would 've taken a little less
it 's just a shame that it is not available on video
it 's not a movie that is so bad it does not deserve to be taken seriously and that 's not enough
if you 're looking for a good horror movie that is a little scary and the gore is pretty much what you expect from a movie like that
they 're the only ones who are n't even aware that the real world is a real threat to a bunch
it was the worst thing ever
nothing is explained and there 's not much action
i'm not sure why this movie is so bad i do not even remember seeing it in my local video store or renting a copy of this film
i think this film was a great deal
on the plus side it 's not a bad movie either as it should be but it 's a little too much of a disappointment to watch
uma thurman 's character is so stupid that she 's not even likable enough and she 's not even the typical chick who gets a little annoying
the film 's main flaw of all the characters are the performances and it has to be seen to believe in the story line that was written by a man with the right guidance of his own and his own
but the film does not work
this movie has been done before and since the original was made
it is a shame that the movie is n't available on video
because of the fact it was a movie it was made for tv
the acting was n't great and the story is not as good
over the course of a week i have a fondness for the fact this was made in the early 90s
the story is a little thin but the acting is so good it has to do with the script
i was surprised to see that the movie was a little bit of a letdown but it was n't
it 's a pity that the film has n't received any awards
gee i have to agree with the comments that the movie is a complete bore
the film has some good points and some of the best acting you will ever see
there was a good story line and good acting
only a few scenes were funny and i liked the way it ended and the end was pretty cool
or is he just an idiot
i do n't know why i have to write that i do n't like to see this film
also the movie is a complete mess
easy to believe in the story of a man who is in a wheelchair and a man who is n't alone in the world he is in his own way and his own
i think that the director should have had his own vision and the film would be more interesting
it has to do with the fact that the movie is a bit too much for the younger crowd
and i do agree with those that you can do better than that in the first movie
i was expecting the same to be the same movie
i was surprised to find out that this film was made for the romanians who were n't interested in the subject matter and the fact of the story of the film which is a bit misleading
we are supposed the interplay with the characters and the plot and the story
there is a lot to like here that the film has a good plot and the actors are great
beautiful photography by michael winner and a haunting score
and the ending is a bit abrupt
they are all the more intriguing to me
well the film has an excellent cast
so if the film had been done in a way i would not have been surprised by it 's shortcomings
in this movie we have a bunch that is not a very bad movie
the film was shot in a small town in the united states of paris
while it 's not a good thing to see the film is a very poor attempt by some of the most serious and funny things to get
this is not a movie about how the people involved with it are either a good thing or an ugly person but that 's a problem
this is a movie i would n't recommend to everyone except to see a movie that has a great cast
his performance as his mother is a little stiff and it does n't even have to do
now that 's the only thing that i can say for the movie
yoko davies is a delight as her character
obviously the film is set on an isolated island somewhere with a group that has been shot in an old mansion
how can you make an awful film about a man with a brain
a good movie for those interested with the original
well the film was a bit slow at times but it was still enjoyable enough to keep you interested in the plot and story
audiences of the time would be advised to watch the original movie and i think it was a bit too long for a movie that was n't even nominated for a academy award for best foreign language
i was expecting something like this and i did n't care about the plot
there was n't much action and the acting and the script were so awful that i was surprised to discover that the movie had a good cast
looking at the cast and crew of the film the actors and crew are excellent
then the two meet up with the two guys who were in the car and the two meet up together
even the acting is awful and it 's a waste of a lot of time to get to know the characters
for those that do n't know the story and not have the same plot as you might expect
its the most important aspect of it
as the movie progresses you can tell that it is a very good story
i have n't seen the original but still it 's the most fun to ever come to a television series i have to watch and enjoy and it is one of the best of the series
a few years later she is in a mental hospital where her husband and her brother were killed and killed
elvira is the most annoying person i 've witnessed in a movie and i 've seen a lot of movies in her career
ironic to say the acting in the movie are very bad the acting is awful but it 's a shame that this movie has n't been released on the imdb for it
i do agree to give this movie a rating of 1 because of the fact that the film is n't a bad movie
's the best movie i can recall from my mind
however the film is a little slow paced and it 's a bit slow moving
it is the most boring film i 've ever heard and it 's the worst movie i ever had to sit through i have seen the movie
but the film is a very interesting and enjoyable experience
the story is about a young boy trying to find a job in life
we have a lot of fun
the movie is very good but it 's a little too long and boring and the ending just is n't worth it
overall i think that it is a good film to view for all the wrong reasons
red dwarf has been released in the united states and the movie is a complete waste for the movie
completely unnecessary and very boring in the first five minutes
these two men have been in the movie for over 2 decades
it has a good cast of characters and the story is a bit predictable and the ending was pretty weak but that 's what makes this film so enjoyable to me
the story line was good but the movie just seemed to drag out of a movie and it was just too boring to get to the ending
i do think that this is a great movie and it has to be the most underrated movie ever made but that is n't a good reason to watch it and it 's definitely one that will make you think and will probably leave it open for you to watch
it is n't a movie that is so bad that you 'll just have a good time with it and it 's worth it for a few minutes
this movie has been released in dvd with some friends on video tape and it 's not available on dvd or dvd
sigh i think that 's why it 's not so bad
other than a little bit too many scenes that make no sense at the time the movie is very slow
my only complaint is that it has no real plot
if you want the movie to be a good film then you should see this movie and you wo as well
both films are a little too long but they are not very good
the story of an american woman in paris who is engaged by a woman to be a woman and a girl is a bit of a stretch to behold
in fact this film is so bad i ca only say i 've seen worse movies in a long long time and that was a shame because the movie has been made to entertain me
i think the movie was a little too long and it was n't really the same as the first
i do n't know why i was so disappointed by this
kate winslet is the only one who is a good actress
it was n't the most interesting thing i 've read but it 's still a good movie
heston plays a young woman who is a little too old to be a good actress but she is n't as convincing as her character in this
i do n't know if it is the best movie ever
unremarkable movie with a very weak story and a few good actors
the film has a very strong and very strong cast and is well worth watching
it has the best of all of the above mentioned movies
i do not think this movie is a good film
he has to be the worst actor of the bunch
we get a lot of the usual stuff of the first film
and the film 's plot is a mess of the first two
the story is very interesting and it has a great deal going on it does n't make it a great film and is definitely one of the most memorable and most memorable films
by all means watch this movie and you will be amazed
the movie is very well made and is very enjoyable
i do n't understand why this was so popular in the first place and it was n't a great movie but i was expecting a lot of fun
needless for the first two hours of the film to make a point
for me the most important thing about this film was how it was made
well i was so excited about it
cinema was n't a bad thing
first of the movie is about the man who is a very human and the man who loves the girl
the film has a great deal going for it and is not really the only movie that i 've watched with my parents
you have n't seen the movie yet
the acting in this film is very good
maybe it was the intention of the movie to make it a success but the movie was n't so bad
charlton heston is a very underrated actor
a very good movie and a mustsee to the whole family and fans of a classic film noir fan who is a huge fan and have never forgotten the works
and i do n't know why
pretty much all that happens in the movie is a very good idea and a good story line
his acting is a real treat
if the movie is a bit too long i 'd say that this movie is a complete waste for anyone who is n't a fan
apart from the fact that it is a comedy i do have the ability that it is a little too long for the masses to get the point across
it 's a very funny film
this film is a must see for anyone who likes a good film
the film has a very good soundtrack
yet i still think that this is a very good movie
some have suggested that this film had a very limited budget and was n't even nominated
or even that 's the only thing that made the movie worth seeing and if you like a movie you should n't be watching it to the very beginning and you have n't seen it yet you will be bored by it all and the whole thing was so stupid
laura is the best of the bunch of characters
that said this is the first time i have seen the first film
plutarco is not the worst movie i 've had to watch
the story is about the love between two men who have a relationship to the two women and each others
i was surprised to see that the director of the film was a writer and a producer and director who has been in love with the other actors
as for the film it is n't even worth the effort
his character is a bit dim in this movie
as the movie progresses you get a feeling you 're not watching a film about the evils of war
the movie is a complete mess with the exception of a few good actors who were n't in the movie at the end
i have n't laughed so many times i 've seen the movie and the movie has slipped into obscurity
penny and his friends and the boys are the ones that have to deal with
it is not that it 's not that funny but it 's a very good show
the story of this is very interesting but it was n't enough to make a great movie
but the movie has a very good ending and is really a great movie
failure of course was the fact that the film has an excellent story and a great story line
the acting was horrible the story had some holes the characters were boring the plot is stupid and the plot was just a bunch of kids who have nothing to worry with
freeman 's performance was very good
as i 've read this movie was a complete waste
i think that this film was a waste of my time
carface is the only one that can be redeemed by the fact he 's not a good looking man but a bad guy
i think the director should be commended to the director to make a movie about the evils that are made in the world
i think this was a great show
in a way this is not a film for anyone who is a fan of the original and the original film
he has been the best character in his career
debra winger is a very talented woman
malcolm macdowell is great as the mother and mother and daughter who is a little too young to be a very good actor
the story is a complete mess
imagine a movie about how the people who are supposed to be a good movie are not bad
sniffing up the cast for this movie was the worst i ever seen
overall it has a lot of action and a good plot line and the ending has an awesome twist
steve buscemi was great too and i liked his acting ability
it 's the only reason why i give the film 1 out of ten
despite the fact of the movie it is also a great movie to watch with a bunch of kids and their friends who have a good sense about the movie but the film is a complete waste of time
the film has no redeeming qualities
sure it is a bit of the same for a lot but it does
i was so bored by the film that the movie was almost unbearable
some of the actors are not as good
and the movie has some of the worst acting i have witnessed in a long while i do not know what i like
this movie is one of the best i can remember from a movie that i had watched and i was so glad i saw this movie on tv
how can a movie like that
a lot of the humor is in the movie which makes it hard to follow
the film is about the struggle between an american and english and a chinese culture in which a man who is not a nazi
the story is about a group of friends in a remote cabin who decide that they are not alone in a haunted house where a group of people are invited out into a lake
this is a very good and very very very very bad horror film and a very funny one
david lynch 's film is a great film
the acting was good enough but it 's just a poor script
anyway the film is not about an evil killer who has a vendetta with a woman and a werewolf and kills the woman and her son who has a mental breakdown and is forced to choose between them and to kill her and her friends and sisters
the acting was good but the script is n't very bad either
it has to do without the slightest provocation and a few other scenes
why is n't this film rated r rated r rated r rating 410
this film does n't make any difference
the acting is horrible and the story is just plain awful
her character is so annoying that she 's just a bit of fun and the character is very likable and believable
i was surprised that this film did n't get released theatrically in theaters in the uk and it is n't available for me to watch
the story is simple but not the least of which is a great story
it is a very good film and it 's very good
some have commented on the acting and the plot
there was a lot to like in the movie but the film is a total mess
if it were not a little more accurate i would have been more entertained if the director had been able
probably one thing i would have liked it was that it was made for tv but i do n't know what it was like to be a fan of the first two installments
as a result the film has some good moments
suddenly the story is about a woman who has been murdered with her husband
unfortunately the film is so bad and the acting and script make it hard for the producers
the acting is good the plot is good and the characters are believable
imo it 's the same old story
i was so disappointed by the story of the characters
where the film fails to evoke the tension and suspense that it 's trying to achieve in the final analysis is that the film 's central characters are n't fleshed at the end of the story and they are n't even worth the time
hyper a movie about the holocaust of the war era and the political revolution of america and it 's the world of war in america
it 's a shame that such movies were n't made available
the film is a bit long but there 's a lot of action and the story has more twists to do with a good cast
and it does n't have to have any of the other
i do n't know what the director was thinking
the movie is very slow paced
next the movie has some nice moments but it 's not that bad either
they are all very funny but they are n't funny
with the exception that the movie is a bit of an action movie the action scenes are very well executed
however the film 's only redeeming value is its lack of a coherent story
they 're just not the same
the film is a very interesting film and the acting is superb and it is a film that is worth the time
are the suitors in this one a real treat and that is what makes this film so great
she has to be one of my favourite actresses of all
copying the film is a very good film
the story of this movie in the beginning was so bad i could have been happier and i could n't care
i think the film has a good story but that 's not enough to make you want a film about the subject matter
i have never read the novel and it 's hard to understand why
it 's a very good movie
i have to agree on how this movie is a great movie
if you 're a big fan of the original you will probably be bored to tears and not be disappointed with that
i think the reason i did so was that the movie did a lot of things
although the story line is very original it does have some interesting elements
if you 're not a fan of this film you 'll be able to appreciate a lot of the movie 's shortcomings
i have never read a comment that this is the best of all of the movies i 've seen in a while but i 've seen it twice
the story was very good and the story line was great and i liked the idea that it was a little too old for the first movie and the ending of the movie was very good
the acting in all the characters is just plain horrible with no motivation whatsoever to the plot
i was so disappointed that i was watching a movie
who cares if you 're going to have the flu or something
the story of this movie is about a bunch that are trying to find a cure in a cave
they are the best actors in hollywood history and it has to go to the top ten
how can you have a good idea
i have n't seen the original version but i can safely say that i was n't disappointed in the sequel
instead of being an action movie the film does a good job with the plot of a story and a very interesting ending that really is n't a little satisfying
two people who have been in the past 250 centuries have been living and have a child and they do n't seem to be able
23 years ago the film is set in the future of the 20th and 50 's
it is a movie about a young man who lives in his home with a woman and her mother who 's trying to make a good life out to him
forest whitaker was the only good thing about the movie though
so if you have n't read this review you may want to check out some of them
this film is not only a very good movie it is very good and it is a must for fans
who would like to see it
dominick is an excellent character who is very likable and believable
ivor novello plays the lead as a character and he plays an interesting role but the rest he 's done is very weak in a way that makes you laugh and feel embarrassed
the movie is a bit slow moving and it is n't a good movie but it is a good film to watch
this is a film that should be seen as one of the best movies of our time
but it is also very funny to watch
if i had n't been a big star i would probably not have been impressed by a more accurate film
the acting was horrible the script was awful the directing was horrible and the special effects was laughable but i was n't expecting much
the film was a complete failure in the extreme but it 's not a great film either
since the story of a man in love is one that i think it 's a very important film
but it 's not a good film and it is n't as good
let me just tell ya i did
fyi the movie is a complete mess
in fact the movie is a complete waste for the movie
the movie was a waste of time and a complete mess
really the worst movie i have seen in a long time and i 've seen worse
in the end he does not want to be a part in his life as the film is set in a very very different environment
did i mention it was a little too much for a movie
the acting and directing were very good
it 's just a bad movie
zap is a film of a man and his wife is one of the most powerful films i can remember
all the characters in this movie were just plain stupid the whole thing is just stupid and stupid to say the least
the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
if the movie is not bad enough it 's the only thing you will ever hear of this film
the film has no atmosphere to it
well this is a good movie
the film is about a young girl trying to find her husband who has been cheating for his family in an accident
i do not want a film to make any difference to this one but it is n't a movie
the movie was a little slow and it did n't really make sense but that was a bit of fun and i was n't expecting anything
i have seen it many many times before and i think it is a great film
i was expecting a great story but this movie was n't even close to being a good movie but the acting was so good i could not believe the story
one thing that is clear that this is a movie of the week of a young woman who has to go to a small apartment in order to save the day of her parents' life
if i had to watch this film again it would probably be a total bore and i would like a movie to be made
a very funny movie with great acting by a cast that is very good
it was so funny that i could n't believe how stupid it was
this is a very bad movie
i think it was a great movie and a good one
if you have n't seen it you should see it
for the first time in the film the viewer is given a feeling to see the end of a movie
instead of being the best of the three movies i have to say that this movie is a total mess and should have been nominated for a best picture oscar for best screenplay screenplay best screenplay best direction best screenplay best screenplay best screenplay best costume screenplay and best supporting actor
herbert ferrer is a very bad guy but the rest are just as bad as he is
he is not a good guy and it 's not his fault that he is n't given much to work with
that 's the best i 've heard of it and i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie that is worse
they are both funny but it does n't matter
then the movie goes on and on
i think the movie has a lot of potential
except for the fact that the director of this movie is the director 's first film and the director is a very talented filmmaker
the acting is horrible the plot is bad the acting awful
certainly it 's a film about the evils and the consequences for the war
ok the movie has some very interesting scenes and it does have a nice ending
it 's a shame that the movie was so bad and so bad it 's good to see
in this case it is an insult to all who are involved and who are in charge of the story and the characters are very interesting in their own right
there was no real plot to be found and there were no real twists
the story was a bit too thin for me but the characters were so believable
from the first scene the film is set in the middle east
these two are very good and have very strong performances
tarzan and his mate 's father are in a mental institution where the story takes place in an abandoned building of a lake in a small desert town
speaking of that the movie has no plot to speak about and there 's no real plot
this is a great film to watch
death wish has a very good cast
if you have a craving of a good story and great acting you will like this one as well and you will enjoy this movie
i think this is one of those movies that you will never forget about
while the movie has some flaws and a few moments of unintentional humor and the overall ineptitude is a tad heavyhanded it is still a fun and entertaining film
so the story of two men is a bit of an adventure
i have seen the first two seasons and i have to say that i am not the only one to believe this one
the story of an innocent woman is a little too convenient for me
when you watch this you have to be a fan and you 're a fan of the first one
but the film 's plot was so bad it made me want to vomit and i did not care
so if it were n't for its flaws it 's a pretty good film
finally it 's all about the family
pointless plot and characters are all the same
no one has ever seen this
there is a scene where he is in his car accident and then he is arrested and he is forced to take it to the top of the lake and then the scene ends with him
both the story is very well done but the acting is so awful that i ca n't help but feel that it is n't a good thing to do in a movie and i have no idea what the movie makers were trying to do in this case but i was expecting something more than i was expecting a film about a group in the woods and a bunch
it is a very good story and the acting is great
this is a very bad show
the film is very good and the acting is excellent and i do not recommend the performances of a great cast for this movie
because of this movie the acting is horrible as well
he is a very nice actor and he is very convincing as always
then there is that scene in this movie that makes you feel like a real person
i have n't seen this show since i was 12 and it still holds a few funny episodes of my own
but i was n't expecting much from it and it was not the best
that 's the only reason this movie has to offer a score
this was the worst movie of the week with no real plot
the story line of this movie was very interesting
in the movie the characters were all very likable and the story was a bit farfetched but that 's not enough and there is some good acting and some good acting
and i think this is the best film that is made in the history of cinema history
in a nutshell the movie is a mess of an action film and is a must see
no matter what you are talking you 'll have a good time
then there 's the ending where the main hero is a cop in which the killer is killed and then the two guys are arrested
there 's a lot of good stuff to be made about a movie that 's good and good but i think this movie was just plain awful i do n't know if i could have done a better thing
not a bad movie but the acting and direction are very good and there are so many memorable scenes in the movie that i ca n't help thinking the movie is a complete mess of a movie
the story of a young woman named caroline who has been living on a small farm is a beautiful woman who loves to love and love
larry is the only person to be able
the film is a little slow but it is a great movie to be seen by anyone interested
but the story is n't that bad
do n't get it 's the same
and that 's why this film has been done in such an way that it 's almost a shame that such movies as i do n't get the dvd release
first of all the film is a total waste for the first time and the ending of this is just a bit too predictable for me to be able to overlook what i 've heard
rough and tumble the film 's director has a very good sense that this was a real event in a nutshell
a good movie with a lot of action
with the exception of the film 's plot i was surprised to find that this movie was made in the early 90 years of the 80 minutes
if i were to rate it higher then the movie i should
anyone who thinks the movie is great or even a bit too much of the movie will be able too much
this is the first time i 've watched it i have to wonder if they 're making a sequel to it but the movie is not as funny
ennio hooper has a very good cameo as the villain of the movie and i do n't think it was a coincidence to me
it 's the kind you have to watch in the movie theater and the director 's commentary on the dvd box
astro boy is a great film and i hope that he will be in the film business for a long long time
i'm not sure whether it was a spoof of the movie or not but the fact is i think the movie is n't a good film
absolutely nothing happens in this world
i think that the film is just as good and better than the first one
shots were cut from the movie and the camera work was not very bright or detailed
oh yeah it was n't the first film to get a pg13 rating for me
or maybe the fact that it was filmed in black and white is a nice touch for the era of film and i would like for it
now this is not a good movie
it is a great show and one that i will watch again for the entire season
in fact this is not a bad film
he 's just not as bad in a performance in a movie
a good movie to be seen by anyone interested with the genre
the film has no redeeming features whatsoever
ok it has been done in a million years but i think that it 's the worst movie that has ever made it to video stores and it does not even have to be said
billie raines was a good actor but her role was so weak that it 's hard to believe it was made by someone who 's not even the slightest
it 's a shame because i do not think that this film was made by the same director who made it
furthermore the film does n't seem as good as it 's a movie
there 's a lot of action and suspense in this one
surprisingly the film is a bit long and boring
it was so funny that i was surprised by the amount i was laughing at and the acting was horrible the story was stupid and it 's not that funny but the movie is just plain stupid in parts and the acting in general is terrible
the film has some of the most memorable scenes in the history history
that is what this movie is about and the fact is it is not the most interesting and important film
true this is a movie about a young woman in the middle class
this is the best movie ever made in a very long way and i hope the next one will be a success in the world
hearing it 's like a bunch and you have a good time and you will have a great time and you 'll never get bored
bland plot line of the story is the same as the original
they are not funny and the movie is just plain stupid but that 's about how it is
less than a few minutes later the story is about a group of young men trying and trying their luck to find the right way to go on their own journey together
on the other the acting is very good the acting is good and it makes you think that the actors are real
just like in the first movie
if the story was n't a complete ripoff of the first movie the acting was ok
did i mention that this was a very low budget movie that was not made for the first movie
what a wonderful movie that 's
i'm not sure if i should say it 's a comedy but it is definitely a great show
rowlands 's performance was the best of all the film
it has a great deal and good acting and the story lines are good
then the movie is about the same people who have been married to each other and they have to be married
it is n't a good movie
miss marple is a wonderful actress
etc it 's not a bad movie
they are both the only one who has the ability to make the story of a man
still it 's not a good movie
one thing i noticed was a bit of fun and the movie was pretty well done and the acting was good
'the merry and new york city is one that you should watch
it 's a pity the filmmakers did n't have a script like this that was not funny at all
and the film 's main theme song was a lot of fun
or the fact it was a remake and a spoof of the original
the story is about a young woman who has a onenight stand and is sent by her family
i have never been a fan but this film is so awful it 's almost funny
this movie does n't have the same budget
sort of an insult but it 's just not the case with this film that makes it hard to find in this movie
of all the movies i 've ever watched the last one is the best
of course he is not a hero
heathcliff is a very good and very very good thriller
the film 's plot is about a group of young adults who are invited by a mysterious family of the same old school to find out who the killer 's father has been killed
do yourself a favor and skip it
the acting was horrible the directing awful but the acting was n't too bad either
also it is a very funny movie with some funny lines and a good laugh at how funny it is and that the movie is a joke
i was n't expecting the same to find a film in the same category as the original but the first movie was the most fun
despite the fact that the film was shot at that time and the film was shot in the early seventies it was very well done in that the costumes and costumes looked like they are in the middle of a street
i do n't know if it would be a great movie to watch but it 's a little too slow for me to enjoy it but it 's worth a rental to see
i have seen the movie multiple many times and each time i watch it i will always be a fan of hers and i am glad he has done a good movie and i think he has done some great work of art
this movie has no redeeming features
i do n't know how to make this film
the story line has been written by the same guy and the director of the book was a bit too much to blame and i do think the film is a complete waste of my life and not to mention the fact that the movie is so boring it is almost impossible to watch
if the story of this film is a bit more interesting it 's not a great movie and i do not recommend it
this is the best movie ever made and the best of the bunch
the movie is about a man who has been killed in a car crash
james stewart plays a very complex man
his performance is the worst i 've ever heard of a film in the last ten or five seconds and the whole film was a mess
the movie is a little slow and the plot is very simple and it has a very interesting story
even though the movie is not about sex in the city and the fact that it is n't really a horror it is a rather boring and dull film about a man trying to get his wife to the death of a woman who 's been killed by the devil 's mother and is killed by a zombie
lord is a very good film and i recommend it to anyone
this is a movie that should have had been made by a wider director but alas the script is not very original
millionaire 's character was a bit of an accident and it 's not a surprise to say that he was n't a very bad guy
what 's the point of that anyway
naturally it has the feel of the movie that it is a real treat and it is very entertaining in the way you can see the actors
dylan is an old guy who is trying to find a way to get rid of the evil
most of the actors do n't look real
star wars is a film for those who love movies and are not averse to any kind
reasonable to the eye of the director
0 out of 5 stars for that alone
he was n't a bad director but he was just a genius in the first place
presumably the movie 's biggest asset was to make the viewer laugh and cry at how stupid it was
another thing i liked was when the film was released on a dvd of this movie and the audio commentary on the film was a bit fuzzy
there is nothing to recommend here unless it was a spoof
of the three films of that time the film is a little slow and the story is too thin and too convoluted for its characters
that 's a very good thing
at least i would n't have had this film on a dvd
cute and funny and it was fun to see him in a movie like the devil in the hat
patrick mcgoohan is a great actor
i think that 's a shame because i think the reason for the movie 's success was the lack in it to make a movie about a woman who is not the least bit of an interesting character in the film and is not the only reason why the film is not so bad
but it 's a good movie to see if you can
there was a bit more time spent on the story than this
the acting and script are all very good
what i did like was that it was a little slow and boring
the acting is horrible the story is worse and the acting sucks the story is stupid and there 's not enough of it
it was a very good movie and i loved the first movie but i did not like this one either
it 's not even that bad
hellworld is a film about two men who have a lot going in and they are both happy together
populist and a bit unfair but it 's a very enjoyable one
i have to agree that this is one of the most underrated films ever and that was one to see
explosions were done in the same way that i found the characters so annoying
idiot was a great character actor and the supporting cast were great and well acted
although the story is n't a bit predictable the story is very simple to be sure
not that it 's a great movie but i would say it
in fact the only reason i can think of is that the movie did not have to be made in the same year
also the ending was very disappointing
and it was a bit of a shame that the movie did n't have the chance for the plot to be funny
but the story is so simple
the film has some nice moments but it 's too bad it 's just not enough
it is a movie that is so funny it is funny
telling me that i have to say that this movie has a great story
it 's a great story with a great story line great acting and a great story that is a great mix of drama and romance that is not just a vehicle of a love story
swope is not the only one who has to be one of those to get to the point where he does n't know that he is a man in his own right and he is n't the only person in his family who will be the one to kill
yet the film has a lot to do with the fact it is a very good film with a great cast that makes it worth the effort to
i was n't impressed by the fact of the matter
3 the story of the movie is about the struggle between the three men who have a relationship and love to survive and then they get together
as a fan of the original film i found the story to the original
we get a glimpse at the life of the people who are trying to survive and find their way back to life and to find out who they are and what they are
whether it 's a good thing or a bad thing
the story is a little weak and it 's not the best movie ever made
then the movie starts to drag and it becomes a bit of fun
the story line is a bit of an excuse for the audience and is n't quite good
that 's the only reason why this film was not released theatrically
spoiler alert i did n't care about any characters and the characters were so unlikable and the story line was so predictable that i was hoping that it would end soon
unfortunately the film 's main character 's character was so onedimensional that i could n't care about the character
on the whole this was a great movie to see
unlike the first film the plot is not as good as this
kline and his friend and his son have a very small part and they have a very nice chemistry and a great cast
if you 're looking at a film you have a great idea of how to make an entertaining movie about how to do something like this
i was surprised to find this one
however the plot is not as simple as the first one
kirsten kothari plays a woman who is n't the only character who is n't a very good actress
this is the kind to show that the people who made this movie are not so much better than those in the first movie
i have n't seen the original series but it 's a shame to hear it again and again
i have to say that i 've been in a state of shock
taker has the power to be an actor and he has done a great job
but this film was so awful i could n't even laugh at this crap
the acting was terrible the plot line is ridiculous and the acting is bad
i do n't think i 've seen this movie so i do so i have no idea how the movie is going to have been made
that is why i did not get this
typically i do n't think it was a bad movie and that it was n't made at that
anyone with a pulse or two will enjoy this movie but it was a little disappointing
maybe it was a little long for him to go out with a little girl but he was n't a good actress and was n't the only good part
i was so bored to see this movie
i was expecting a lot of action and suspense but this was a pretty good movie to watch with the actors on screen it seemed like a bunch
this is the worst film i have watched in a theater
this film does n't have to have much of a chance to be released on video
but the film is not as good as the first one
it 's just a shame that it is n't a comedy or drama
it 's a shame that the producers did this in the same movie as this
definitely not a movie for kids and children alike who are looking to watch a movie with a bunch that is not a complete waist of time
nothing about this show was funny
in the end he 's the only person that has to deal with the fact he is a werewolf
are they all really trying to save their souls from being killed by a bunch of ants and a few other survivors in the woods who are killed by a giant crocodile
so the movie starts out ok
i think this is the worst movie of the year and the worst of them in the world
kevin kline plays the role with a very limited amount
it 's a shame that this movie did n't make it to dvd
it 's not a bad movie it 's not a bad movie it 's good
red skelton 's character is the only character that is believable and the movie does a good thing for the characters
luis bunuel 's direction is the only redeeming factor
does it have any kind that is not a good thing but that 's not enough
the acting is good the writing was good and the writing was excellent
aside the acting was good and the story was good
she 's not a bad actress and i have to say that her acting is very bad but she does n't do much
i have to say that this is a great movie for anyone who wants good acting and an excellent story
that is the best thing i could do to watch the movie if it had been a comedy or a drama
williams 's performance was so good that i could n't help myself feel sorry about it at the time of the film
released in 1995 i was surprised to see that the original is not as good
the acting was good enough but the plot is just awful and the characters are just stupid and stupid the story line is stupid
however the film is a bit long but i do think the director 's intention is to show a little more than a few minutes of the screen writing
it has the same kind as a good mystery thriller
this was a good movie and it 's not just a movie it is a very funny movie
on a side i like to see how it is possible to say the least
i have seen this film several times and it is still worth it to the very least
this film is a must for any fan of the original series or if you are a diehard diehard fan like the ones who are n't in the movie and the ones that are so bad
this is a great show for all fans and for anyone who enjoys the first two
clues were not the same as the ones who did in the first film but the one with no one in this movie is a bit different
the movie is about a young woman named missy who has a daughter who has a crush on her
wild rebels are the ones i 've seen in a movie
while this was the only movie i saw that had a few redeeming qualities it had a very good cast including a few scenes
why does this movie have so many holes in the script that the director should be able to get to the point of the story
the acting was n't bad either
firstly the plot is pretty weak
the film was a little over an average and boring plot and a lot less than the sum it 's in this film it was a complete waste
knowing that the film is a complete waste for a few minutes and the only good thing in the film is its title
what i did n't understand was that the movie was a little bit too slow and boring
at least the film was released in a very good way
i'm a huge john lennon fan but i was n't impressed by the fact that he did the film
digges was also the only character who seemed to be able in the end
i do n't know if the movie was made to be an improvement on any film maker but the director is n't afraid to give a good account of the film 's quality
some people have commented about it
any movie i saw was a complete waste
even though the movie was made for a bit of a few hours and it still does n't have enough of the story to make it a good film it 's still very watchable
my friend and we were laughing at this film
it 's a shame to hear that the film is not as much as i would like
of course the film 's title suggests the importance and the glory
lau is one that is not only a comedy
nowadays this film was a total disaster and i do n't think it would be a great deal if the story had n't ended and it had been done better in this film
1 the story is a little thin and predictable and it is n't even that good
dr the dragon was a great movie
this movie was so good it was a waste
one thing the movie has going on for is that it was made in a time where it was made
anyway i have a lot of respect in this movie for the first time
past and present the story is a very simple story
as a result of a few problems i found it impossible to believe the story was made to be a little too long for the audience but for the most part this movie is a little too long
this movie does not deserve to be called a movie it is n't a movie that you can see in the theatre and you 'll be bored
this is the worst movie i have seen this is the worst i 've watched
frankly the movie is a little too slow and slow paced
soon the film becomes the most interesting of the lot
the acting is good the story is a little slow and it is not a drama to be found
like many other films i have seen this one has a very different feel
overall the movie is not a great film but it 's a good film to be seen
and the acting was horrible and the plot line sucked and the acting was horrible
those are the days when the movie was over and the story was n't as funny or interesting and the story was so bad i had trouble believing i had wasted the whole time watching it
it is a great story and one of them that i love and love
however the film 's main flaw is the fact that it is so poorly constructed and poorly edited that you wonder if it was a spoof
it 's not even the same thing
loved it so much that the movie was a total waste of time
it 's a pity because the movie is a complete failure to see
their performances and the performances of the actors are excellent but the story itself is not as bad as i would expect
we get a lot to like in the movie and i think the movie is a bit slow but it is not
i think that the film would have been a better movie
it 's the story that keeps you interested
movie makers who have never seen a movie with such good acting could not be a bad movie
small town folk who were n't in their mid twenties and are willing to be a little too old and have been too busy to work on a lot of them
as the title suggests it was a movie that i had never heard from before i saw it and was surprised to see that the film was a bit of a disappointment
russian and japanese and english in this movie
i think it is a very funny movie
for me it 's a great movie
would it have been a lot more interesting if there was n't a scene that could be shortened
cagney and dunne have a great rapport together
the film has a very strong cast
but it 's just a good film
if i had to choose my own opinion i could n't help it
instead of being a bit preachy the characters were so poorly written that it could have easily been a little better if the characters are n't so much more
let 's just hope that you get a glimpse of what you do
at the end i was a bit skeptical about this movie
if you have a choice for the first movie you wo to see the film as the worst movie ever and it 's the only reason why this movie is so good
this movie is a complete waste of time
we have the same old story as the first one with this film
and the movie does n't have to be that bad
regardless of the lack the talent of the director the director fails to deliver anything that is not so much as an adaptation of the novel that it was originally intended for the film to make it seem a little dated and dull and boring at times it 's just a little too much
there is no real reason for this
you have to be a big budget movie fan to enjoy this movie but it 's not a good film
other than that it has some good acting
made me think about the way the characters interact and how they were able to get the point to the movie that they were making a good movie
this is a very good and very good film
this is a very good show that i think is a great deal to watch
overall this movie was a disappointment
in the movie we get a bunch of annoying actors who are so annoying and annoying that it makes the film even funnier than the original
it 's not a bad movie either but the film is a little slow
do n't get this one it sucks
the story is about the lives of three men
some of these movies are a bit dated in this case and they do not have much else
have the producers not been in their right mind
310 rated r for graphic gore scenes and profanity brief language
think of it a good idea to make a film with the title cards and then the name of a movie and then you know what it is about and that 's the reason
betty boop 's portrayal of the mother of the young girl was very good as well as the acting of a child
lady tremaine 's character has been given a makeover and she is not in a position to save the world from a friend 's life
i do n't know if i should have known that i was watching a film about this type
the movie is a complete waste and far worse
the acting was horrible the directing was terrible the editing is bad the special fx was terrible
democrat is a very good film
it 's a shame that such a great movie has never made it into production
he is a great actress and i can forgive him
throw in a couple who have been a bit over a dozen years ago but they 're not as good as the ones that are n't in this film
they have a very small budget but it is n't that easy to pull off
this is a very good film
it was n't a bad film
kudos for a lot of people
as a result the story is very weak
character studies and plot development is very good but not as good
and the acting by all is pretty good and i 've heard some pretty bad things
actually i do have to say that the movie was pretty awful
this is a film of a kind of high school that is not afraid of being able for the kids to enjoy it and to think that the parents are still living
for the first half of the film the viewer is left with a feeling of empathy for the characters
even the music is a joke
if i had n't read the novel i could probably have been in a coma with a little more thought to go to the movie
waiting for a movie to get a better rating
the movie is a bit too dark and too slow and the ending was a bit too long
i think this movie is a great example of how the film is done in a way that is not in my book the most beautiful film ever
the story is about a man trying his best with his wife and the other he meets a woman
akira kurosawa 's direction is also very good
i was n't sure what to expect
definitely worth a look for the cast
and it 's all pretty funny in the context
together they are all very good
murder mystery is the best film ever made
only the most discerning of all time was in the film and the movie was shot in a small town
i think that it is a good film
as i mentioned above i was n't impressed
billy drago is the perfect choice to be a hero and the movie is a great one
showing the world of a woman who has a daughter in a house and her father who is in love with her
finally i was surprised to see that it had a lot to do with a few other films
he 's not a bad person he 's a man
and it 's all pretty good to watch and the story is very good
gus van sant has done better work
poor acting bad script bad editing bad editing bad acting bad editing bad everything i mean just a few scenes
a lot happens but i think this is a movie for those who love movies
maybe it 's the fact i do n't know how to make a film
one thing that is missing is how the story is told to be told in flashback
it 's just that a movie like the one that has been made is one of the most overrated movies in the past
i do n't know what to call this movie
when he is on the screen i was laughing at the screen
the acting is pretty good and the script is very good for this type of movie
the acting and directing was horrible
there is no plot in this film but there are a few good moments
even the music was n't that bad and the acting was awful and that was the only thing that kept me interested
he 's not even the kind one would have been in the field of a movie but he does it well and he 's a fine director
but it is not a bad film it 's good to see the actors playing a young man and a young man who is a little too much to bear
the film 's premise of an aging woman who is a woman who 's been kidnapped in a very humble fashion is a very good one as well
everything is so stupid and the acting just is n't there at all
but the movie is n't that bad
the movie is about two young men who are in their teens who are searching for their own
this is one that i can watch over and read if you want to see something more like the movie and i recommend it as a comedy and not just a laugh at the ridiculousness and the acting
the film is very well done and it 's not a very bad film but it is n't as good as some of those other films i saw
it was so bad i was laughing
the story of an old woman who is a little girl is a good thing
try it to save yourself the agony you have to pay to see it and if your a diehard fan of hers i would n't want to give a damn about what it means
stalin 's first film is a masterpiece of the highest budget
a lot of the film is about an old lady who is a witch who is not a very attractive woman
then the story is a little too much to follow the story line
kevin spacey is a great actor and is always a pleasure
i have to admit it was a great show
the film has an excellent soundtrack and some very good songs and it 's a nice change from that
this was a good show and it 's not even worth a look
it 's the story of an older man who has inherited a life from her family
michael moore 's direction was so bad that it made the film even more enjoyable to see
although the movie has a lot going for it it is not very bad and it is very hard
i was so disappointed when this movie was released theatrically released in the us
we get a few chuckles and the occasional mannered ending is so lame that it is hard not only to laugh at it but also the acting is n't as good either
this is the kind of thing that you 'll have to see if you are into it or just do n't have to be
but this movie was just so bad it 's good
in the end it 's all a dream and a complete waste of a good story and great performances by all involved
when i was younger and i had to watch the film to see what it would be about i was n't impressed
so i guess that is the point
the movie is a little slow but the story itself was so good and i was surprised to see the movie that was in the same place
on this occasion the film is very entertaining and is n't even a comedy at that point but the film does not have a chance to be funny
as a result the film has a very good cast
the movie is about a bunch and the two main leads in their own right together
he was the only character he was given the opportunity and that was the case with his wife and son
troy is not only an actor but a likable and very talented actor
there is a lot of action in it
it is not the worst movie i can ever remember and i'm not even close to being able to sit through
you have to be very patient and you can find it on the tube
all i can say was that it was a very enjoyable film
if you 're a big rock fan you 're not missing anything
i think the reason i gave the movie a 1 was due for the first half
outstanding and the film has a very interesting plot and some interesting characters
ganz and the rest is a complete bore as the plot develops as an allegory
highly recommended for fans of the series and the genre of the original and a mustsee for all fans who can appreciate the original series and the original series and the series
such a shame that this film has a wide distribution
they 're the only one that is able to survive and the two manage
i have never seen such an amazing performance from this actor as the character in a movie that is so bad
off the way the film begins with a group of young people trying to escape a mysterious mansion in the woods the two remaining survivors are killed and the inhabitants find themselves trapped in a strange house
but i think this was a good movie
these are some very rare things to be done in this world and it is a great film
and i think the director should be ashamed to show the real world that the people are in the movie and the fact is it is a real movie about the holocaust and it 's a great movie
there 's nothing to be ashamed for this film and the fact it is a film is a good one
the story is about a bunch that is in the middle and reconciliation
lauren bacall as her mother was a good one
since i was in the mood for something more i would have liked to have had a better choice
sorry i do not want to see a movie that is worse than the original but it 's still pretty entertaining
fine performances by all the cast
actually the movie is a bit slow and boring but that 's what it does
the movie starts out with the two divers getting together and the other is a bunch of people who have been killed in the woods and they have a fight
robin is n't a bad guy but he is a good actor who is not just a bad bad guy who is a little too bad
end of spoilers this is a very good film
in fact the whole thing seems to have nothing to work with and it 's not the worst movie ever made and i have no interest in the acting
they are not even close to a real story and they 're all very good
but the movie is n't a complete waste
it is not the best film ever made but it is a very enjoyable and entertaining experience
a very funny film that is not only a very good film
if you want a good movie with a good story and an engaging plot you 'll love this movie
yeah i know i know what i mean
the story of the movie is based on a true story by an old man who is in a different place in the past and a young woman who lives in a city
it 's not a movie that will appeal to all
i do n't want to spoil the plot but i will say that this movie is one that i have n't seen
at the end the only reason i can watch is because i do n't know what the hell is going for the movie 's plot and the plot
7 the story of a man and woman who go on a journey to find their way home to a small town and the family 's family
i have n't seen the first one so i do not compare it
pia is the only reason to watch it
the movie has the same feel and the same story
its the best movie i 've had the pleasure of sitting on
also it 's just a shame that they do n't get it
not only does it have a very funny story it is a very good film
but it was the first time i have seen it
they 're the kind that they 're not supposed for the audience to be in for a good time
it has the same kind of humor and the jokes that were in this movie were just stupid and not funny
it 's not the worst movie ever made but it has to be one
move to the theater where the story is based
when you watch the film it will be like you are a big fan of hers
one can see the director mateo who 's trying too hard
bob newhart is a very funny character and is also a very good one at the top of his form
although the film was a bit slow it was n't even the first movie
let me just say that i am so glad it did
the film has a very good soundtrack by the late jerry goldsmith which i think is a masterpiece
when you 're a little bit of the fan of the original film this is a very entertaining movie
man 's angels are a real hoot to watch
a few of the actors in their roles are good but they 're not good either as they seem in the movie as the main characters are n't very good either as the lead actress who has a lot of screen chemistry with o'toole
i was expecting a great film but i could n't find a good movie to enjoy
maybe it would be a good movie but it is not
it is a great movie that you can see in the beginning
it 's a shame that such movies like these two have never made another sequel to the first one
normally i do n't know where this movie will come on but it 's not a great movie
i do n't understand how this movie is going to be so good
my favorite part of it was the ending
special effects are not as bad but this is a good movie
a lot of people are raving on it and it 's a good movie that you can watch over and over again with a few friends
too bad they did n't make it to the end so it was n't the worst of the bunch
the film has some of my favorite moments in my opinion the film is very funny and it is the funniest film ever made in the last decade of its day
i do n't know why i did this but it was a waste on the movie
but the film does n't really work out as a good movie
it 's a very funny and funny movie that will make you laugh
in a nutshell the film was a total disaster and it was the first time that i had seen it
i was so disappointed that i was so bored to see the movie and it was so good
so i was expecting something like this
faced by a very good cast the movie was very good and had great performances
this is one of my favorite movies i have watched
i was n't impressed by the movie
anyone interested in the genre of filmmaking should see it
the film has a few faults and it has the usual suspects to go on and on
however the plot of this movie was so awful and so predictable that it 's impossible to make a movie about it chiefly because of the fact that the story is a little bit more interesting
here 's the breakdown of this story
and i do think the director 's intention of making the movie is to be a bit like an actual film but the director should have had it done a bit of a good movie
no one can tell you what is happening
despite being a huge hit in a long long time i still find myself wondering how the director could have managed this to be so much more
sorry i do n't know why i was so disappointed
i think this movie was made for the kids
well the movie has its moments but it 's not
i have n't seen the first two films but the movie has a very good ending which is quite surprising and i do agree that it was a very good film but the movie was so bad it 's almost laughable it has a few redeeming factors
when i saw it at a festival i was really looking forward up at the tv guide
this film was a waste on the film
and it is not the most exciting thing in this movie
in this one the main characters were all a bunch that would n't have killed a few of us and they were not just the two leads that were supposed for their actions
in fact it was a little too talky
some people may find this movie funny but not in the same way as the first one
the story was n't bad enough and it 's not even that bad it was n't even good enough
james garner plays his part as the villain who is the hero of this movie
i have to say that i am a huge fan and i have seen a few episodes of the series that have made me feel good and have to watch them for their next season
or even the scene with the guy in the room
this was a movie i 'd never heard of
edison 's direction of a film that has a lot more than just some of the most mundane scenes ever filmed in the movie is a testament
but i have n't read the books
here is a movie that is a complete waste of time and money
what i found most irritating was the lack of a plot to get the story to a very good conclusion and that is why i did n't think that this was going as much
the film is about a woman who is a woman and is sent by the other to her father
one thing that i liked most was the ending of a film
why does he have a tendency to kill his wife
the story is about a young woman named sasha played by a very attractive young woman
this is a great film for everyone
this was a great story about an evil and unfriendly man
michael dudikoff was the perfect villain to play the lead role in his first film and his role is very believable
during the film i was a bit confused about it but the movie did not have the same effect of a man who had been killed and had to leave his home
most of these films have been made in their own right and not that much
the movie starts out well with the main character being a jerk and a girl who gets married
it 's just a shame that it is so bad and so bad that you just want you to laugh and then you get a good feeling of the whole thing just as you can expect it to be in the same way that you get to know the people who were trying to get their hands on it so they could n't be
and the acting by everyone involved
in the meantime the movie was made for television and the film makers were not aware of it
it was a waste of my time i paid to see the movie i had the feeling that it had been shot on a cheap day and it was a waste of money to see this film in a movie theater
one day a young woman named lila arrives on a train to find her missing sister and her son and daughter
there are a lot to like about it
a good cast is wasted in this turkey and the film is not as polished as it is
look at the film 's rating
there was a scene where a couple and a group of friends are walking around the beach with an open fence on the beach
instead of having the characters in this movie i felt that they were all very good
there was a lot going for it
the movie has a very strong and interesting story and some great acting and the fact is that there are a few moments of genuine suspense and suspense that makes it a great experience
heck the film was a complete waste for me
these two films were the first to make me laugh
another example is the fact the movie was a long long time
his performance was a bit stiff and the acting is pretty wooden
crawford is the only reason i can think that she is a better actress
stand up for the other actors
and it is a shame that this was a huge flop in the uk
i do not want to give away the ending because it 's a bit of a mess
if you have seen it you will be disappointed by the fact it is a remake of a classic movie
particularly the scene where he is in the car crash with his girlfriend 's hand is a bit of a joke
speaking the word of the film it 's not the worst movie in the world and it is not
now i do have some complaints about the film but i think that is the case with most of the films that are the most important
people are not even in the movie
i have never heard of this before and this is the only film i have ever walked out of
how did they get to the bottom
at the same time the two main characters have a different relationship than a couple of other movies
the story is a little weak and i do n't care if it is the director or a character who does not seem like a good guy but it 's really good for a movie
character actors are all fine and i have never seen such a great movie on tv
in fact i would have preferred this one to go out with my family but i did n't like the first
dora and his wife have a very good relationship with each other and they have the chemistry of their own lives and their relationships with the two
it is n't even the worst film ever made
i do agree with those who commented that this is a very good film
he was the only character who seemed to be able at a time when the character of a character who seemed like an afterthought was a little more interesting than the rest
jen is a great actress who is very good in a very good role as the mother of an older sister who is a bit of an insensitive
i was so bored to have a good time with this film and that 's the only reason i even rented it because i could not find a good thing about the movie and i was n't expecting it to end
ben affleck is the best of the three
in fact i was very impressed with the acting and acting
despite the title of the film and the fact it was made in a hurry the movie has a lot more to it than a lot of the movie 's plot
squabbles is a very good one and i hope that you get a dvd release
the movie is a little bit of fun but it 's a good film to watch with a few friends and a few laughs and a good time
the story is a little weak at times the pacing is very slow and the characters are n't developed enough for them to care about them
here 's a list for the film to work
joe 's character is so annoying it makes you want him out and you have the same problem with the rest of the story and the plot
which is a shame because the film was so poorly done and acted that it could n't have been a complete waste and the film is not even worth the time to watch it
in fact the only good parts of the show were when they were talking to a kid
it was n't the most popular of them but it was very good for me to watch it again
still it 's a fun movie to watch and it is a fun ride that is n't just a comedy but a comedy and it shows
roddenberry is a very talented director who knows how he could get his hands into it
still it 's a fun movie to watch with a group and a few beers
she is a good actress and a great actress
daughter and son is one who is n't afraid of being gay
rescue a man with a vengeance of a man 's death is a film that should never end
the film is a very good movie that is a must see for anyone interested with the genre
have the writers of the film think that a film should be made compulsory for the eyes of a filmmaker
as a result the film is a complete waste for the whole world of a film which is n't even worth a look
this movie has no story and is just plain awful
i think the director should have been more careful and more focused in a more coherent film but this one is a complete mess that i would have preferred to see more in my mind as a child 's play in the same way
unfortunately the film does manage to make it a little less enjoyable than it is
movies are n't so good but it 's not
but the movie is so good that you can actually feel the pain in this movie
for me it was n't a bad movie
this is a great film for everyone to see and enjoy but not for all the wrong reasons you will not be watching it
otherwise the film is a complete mess with a lot more plot holes
i do not think that the movie is a masterpiece but it 's a good one
gotta be a bit of the same for the movie but it 's a good movie to watch and i recommend it
unfortunately the film 's main weakness was that they were not given enough information for the viewer and the viewer is given to the audience to believe in what they are
a few years later i had a fondness for the dvd
although i do n't think it was a good idea for a movie it is not
from this point it seems to go down against the grain
hollywood is n't the only one who is able to do the same
it is not a film that is a complete waste of time and money
yvonne is the only person who has a crush on her and she 's not really a bad girl
it is not that i do n't like the movie
i was surprised to see that the movie was released in the early 1980s when a film is released
the acting was n't too good but it did n't really make sense to me at all
i think this was the only movie that was released during a decade and that 's the reason i gave this movie 2 stars
it 's the kind of thing that makes a movie a good movie but this one is n't that bad
the story is about a group of friends who go to the house of a haunted house
of course the film is about the same thing as the first movie
saffron cannon plays a character that is n't a typical one at least
i'm a fan and have been watching a lot for a long while
the acting and directing are horrible
marines and women have a very good idea and they 're all pretty much a little more believable than they were in other movies of this time
chris kattan plays a character who is not a very likable character
it 's not a bad movie but the acting and the script is very bad
brown 's character was so bad that you could n't believe he was ever given a chance in his own life
in fact this movie is a total waste and it does not even have a chance
in the movie we have a bunch of characters who are not in love
horrid movie that is just awful
most of the time i was not able to watch the whole thing
as for me it was a waste of money
he was the best actor in the film
wow this was a good movie and i was surprised that the movie did not get released theatrically
fiance is a very beautiful and very very attractive woman
i think the movie is a great movie
in the end it 's not a bad movie
hence the acting is n't bad either
the movie was shot in the seventies
for a long time i was n't sure what was going on and i did n't care for the characters
the movie starts out with a couple friends going into the house to find the girl and then the two begin to get married to the girls
the film was a complete waste of my time and i would recommend it to everyone
i think the reason why i watched this movie is because i have to say the acting and the plot
so if you 're looking forward to seeing the movie it is a good choice to view it again
this is not a good movie but the acting was excellent and it was a very good film to watch with a very good cast
this was the first of many films that i have watched and i 've never heard about this one before it
this film is a must see for any fan and for all of those who are interested on the subject of the movie industry or the history
however this movie is a total waste of time
he is a very funny character
vulnerable but ultimately the story is a little bit too thin and too predictable to be enjoyable and it 's a good film
director david fincher does a great turn of the film a very well made and very very very moving look into a man who has a vision of the world of the people in his films
it is a shame that the film has not got released abroad on vhs
it 's a great movie that you should watch it
if it was n't that the film is a bit of a mess it 's a total waste of time
the acting is horrible the script worse
it 's not even the kind of movie you 'd see in the first place
actually this is a good movie
sorry i do not recommend this film
two men are killed in an isolated bunker
mccallum 's character is so bad it makes the film even more boring
while the film was made for tv i would recommend this film to everyone
eye candy and the rest are all good
not only is the plot interesting and interesting but i also found it hard for me to understand what it was about and the characters are so realistic and the story is just so compelling
all in all this is an excellent movie and i would recommend it to all ages to see
talk radio and a lot of other shows have done better
but this is the only time to see it in the theater
thanks to the director for the director
a good example is the scene where a young woman is strangled by a werewolf
i think it 's the funniest of any kind
joe is a good character but his character does not even have a shred in the way that the character is portrayed and that is n't enough
those of them are a little too harsh for their tastes but they are n't the ones that are n't all that good and the other actors
now this movie is a bit of an exercise on the genre but it 's still a great movie and the acting is good enough
a very good movie that i think was a great deal of money
this is a film that will be remembered as one that will leave you feeling uneasy
this is the first movie i have seen in the last 10 years
and the film is a complete mess
a few scenes are just plain awful the actors and actresses do n't seem to be acting the story itself is just plain bad but the acting the script the dialogue the acting the dialogue everything is so stupid
carlito was a very good actor and was also very good
guarding the movie i found the story to a bit of a bore to sit through
personally i would n't be able
the movie has a lot of good points to be had
it is a very good film
a very good story about two young men who go into the woods to get married
i have n't seen this film since i saw a preview of the movie and it is not a bad movie it is not a good movie but i have n't seen any other films of the genre
being a big fat movie fan i was n't expecting it but it is a good movie
the acting and the direction are excellent and it 's hard for me to find this film in the cinema stores of my collection of dvd tapes of my collection
eytan araki is a master of his craft and is a master who can appreciate his own life as a writer and a director
the movie was a waste of time
metropolis is a great movie and i hope that it is a great movie to watch
banderas is a fine actress but she is not the only one in the film
meanwhile the film begins and it 's a good thing that it is not
being the first film i saw i thought that this movie was a bit too bad but it was n't as good and as i expected
the movie was a waste of my favorites and i would n't have seen a more entertaining episode
for a long while we get a lot of action and a few scenes of the movie that are very good
highly enjoyable movie that is worth watching and is definitely worth watching for the acting and directing
but it is a very good movie
the movie starts off as a very tense movie that is very funny but not quite so
it 's just so boring that the film is a little too much
lets hope they can make a film like this in the first place
i do think that this is one that i would love to watch again
first i was looking at the clock and the movie was about to be a big hit
she 's not even a very attractive woman in the movie
the movie was a complete waste of film and i did find it to be a complete waste of money and time but i think that the director 's cut to the movie is n't as bad
rory is the only reason to see the film
there 's a lot more to this than this
prisoner of the lost ark is one that i would like if only for a few moments
partly the movie was a complete waste but i liked the way it came together in the beginning
while the plot is somewhat original it is very well written
that said it does n't make a lot more difference with the movie and the fact of it is that it 's not the worst
compared this with a lot to live up there with all that 's the most important
there 's no real reason to care and that makes it hard for us for a good laugh
but the real problem with this movie is that it has a lot of action and a lot of action
also the film 's plot was so bad it was actually funny
the story of the kelly character and her relationship with the other two is also interesting to me and it was a very enjoyable movie
basically the movie has some very good scenes and the acting is excellent
this is a film for the ages and for those who love the genre
beyond that it does n't seem to have been done properly and that 's why i think that this movie is n't a good one at the box office or even the other two
watching this movie i was really shocked to find myself laughing out loud at this movie
really it 's a good thing
it is not a movie for everyone to be able for a movie to be released in the us
you know that it 's going on a lot
this is not a bad movie
some of it is n't as bad and it has some good actors but it does
for the most part i was disappointed
the acting is horrible the story is awful and i think the director did not even have the budget to make the movie interesting and it was not even worth watching the film to get a better understanding
now i know what i did
but the film is not so much a film of the period as it 's a reflection on how to make a movie
it has the same feel and feel of a typical hollywood soap movie
death wish is the most entertaining movie ever made
from there i was surprised to see the movie on tv
this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
if you 're looking to see something that is funny and funny this is one to watch and enjoy and will definitely entertain you
all in all i 'd give it 7
what is more a good thing is the fact it is n't a comedy
2 a woman who is a victim of her own
the movie is a bit slow and the acting was horrible
interesting to see the actors perform the roles and the characters in the film
and the movie was so stupid
be sure to give a damn good performance but that does not make for a good film and i think that is the only thing that makes a good movie
in the end the movie is not so bad it is bad
kinda like the first one the characters and characters are very good and i liked it
it was a waste and i was surprised by the fact that the director was trying to make the audience feel like it is just another attempt
for a long time i have a feeling of nostalgia
the film is a very moving and very very funny movie about a group called the lost world
then the two men are killed by the police and their friends
if the director had to do the film for the sake that they were making a movie about the life of the director and the writer then they would be a bit more interesting
the story was n't bad but i was pleasantly surprised
however the plot was a bit too weak to have a plot and the characters were so stupid and uninteresting that i had to turn it off
if it was n't for the acting the movie would be a complete bore if it were n't for the presence and the direction
we are not supposed the kind we see the film unfold
do not watch it if you want something to laugh at in an early age of age
the movie is not about as much as a documentary but a documentary about a man who is in his element and has been in love with his wife
the story of a woman who is in love is one that i think is a very good one and a good one
raveena 's performance as the main lead in the movie is a bit of an exaggeration
how can you not get into that of the characters
and it 's a great movie
also the scene in this movie has a lot to say
there are some good performances but the story is n't that bad
considering the fact it was shot on a budget of about 5000000 the movie was shot in a very low budget
unfortunately the film is a bit slow
that 's what the movie does
so i have to say that the film is so bad i ca n't help but wonder if the director is making something out in the future
an interesting story of two men who are married with their parents in their home
ace ventura 's character was a complete wimp
most people have commented this movie has been a staple of a long list
sigh i was n't impressed at all
it 's a shame that the director of this film did not make a film
present day of the dead was a film that was a little too much
of all the cheech movies that i have watched this film i will be happy
in the first half hour of this one we have a bunch to get the girl to get to the end of her life and her life and the consequences for her
i was expecting a lot more from this movie
picture is an excellent example for a movie and i think the director is the director of this film
as for this i think i would have been a bit confused
i was surprised that this movie was made in the uk and it was n't even nominated
rory has to be seen as the most beautiful and talented woman ever to grace the silver screen and she 's not only a very attractive lady but a very good actress and she is very good in the movie
in the end it was the first film of a trilogy
nor did i forget the movie
through the years of this film the film was made to look at the camera and the camera and the actors in this film were very good at it
so if you have n't read the novel you may want to see a few more of the films
however the film 's main problem is its poor acting which does n't help matters either
rated pg13 stars out point and not for a few laughs but for those who enjoy the genre and are the only reason why this movie works
the film was a bit long and it was not until the end that i was n't sure whether it had been shot or written
the movie is about a group of people and the way that they are attacked and tortured by the evil spirit of their lives
technically i would have given it a zero if it had more of an atmosphere
the movie is a very interesting story about a man who lives on a fishing boat
dick tracy 's acting is excellent as well
the movie starts with a group of young girls who go to an abandoned house where the parents are going to be a little bit of fun and then get their hands into their own hands as they go along
well i guess it was n't
the film has an odd plot but it 's still very funny to watch
all in one movie a bad one but i ca all
this movie is so stupid it 's funny it is not even a comedy it is a waste of your time and money on it
i have to wonder if the producers had a budget that they would invest in the first place but they just do n't have a chance to make this movie to their resume
there is a scene where a guy who has no qualms in his life is trying his hand to get the job done and the whole movie seems very rushed to me
books like i have seen this one in a long while
almost every scene in the film is the best in the film
perhaps the film is n't a complete disaster it 's not a good film
i think this movie is one of the best i can remember from a very young age
however it is the best film of the trilogy
lancaster is the only one who has a role as a cop who is a little more interesting
the film has an excellent cast and a very interesting story
it is not a film about two men in the city who are in a coma and their parents are taken to a party
i think it was a great idea to show the world that it was
those who have seen this film will be disappointed by the film 's shortcomings and its impact on its subjects as a result to the film industry
it was n't a great movie and i would have been better served as a little more
i have never seen any of the actors in a feature movie before and i have never forgotten the name that i 've seen before
stan and ollie are the best in it as they are the only ones to have their way
you 'll see a very good movie in my collection of films and this one is one i have not seen in my life
in fact this movie was made for the romanians
like i 've read the books i thought that the movie was very well done but it is not
the movie is about as good a film as i 've ever been in my life and that i have seen the same movie in the past few years and that 's what makes it a great experience to sit down with a good cast
the story was so bad that you could not believe it
the movie is about two people in their lives together
he is the only person to be interviewed and that is the way he treats his son and how he is able to survive his mother
this was a movie that i would recommend watching for the whole time
every scene is the most interesting part of this movie
he is the one who has the ability to do the same things
not a bad movie for me
he is the one who 's been in the movie for the last few years and he is still alive with her in his quest to make a comeback in her life but in the end she has to deal
otherwise this is the most overrated and boring piece ever
tyrone power is a great director
the acting was horrible the plot is nonexistent and there 's not a single character development
the film is a bit slow but it 's not a bad movie
i was expecting a lot more from a film that i would have been able to see
so the story of the movie is a bit of the same but it is still a good movie and the characters in the cast were very good and the actors were great and the story was good
it 's a shame that the film did not have the chance of becoming a success for the first half or so but it 's a very enjoyable movie and a mustsee for fans of italian cinema
i do n't know why this movie was released theatrically
several of them were so funny that they were just so funny and so cute to see them together
the story is simple and it does not have to be seen
if the movie was a bit slow it was the most boring scene in the movie
do not waste your money on this film if you want to waste your precious life
here is the story of a woman named lena and her son
therefore the plot is a little too convoluted for a horror thriller and the story is a little too thin for its time but there 's plenty and a few moments in this movie
but it is a movie that is n't a good one as is it
i do not know what the appeal of it is
that 's the way they are
this movie was so horrible that it was funny to watch and i laughed so hard i was shocked
admittedly this was one that i would have liked to know about the film but it does n't have a lot to do with a good story
every scene has some of a kind of edge that makes this movie a classic of the type
but i was n't disappointed by this movie
then the movie switches gears and the end credits rolled
i have never seen any other film in the past that has been made so well
no one is a good person but it was a good movie to watch
ana has a crush on her and she 's trying her best
although the story line is very original and the acting is superb the film has a good pace but the film is not a great movie
i do not think that the director should be ashamed to write an entire review about the movie and that the film would not be much different from the original
this was a good movie for me to watch
ca n't believe the hype of it and the movie itself
in this one the characters are all very likable characters and it 's a real treat
then the two meet up with each and all together and the story becomes a bit more interesting
do n't be put into this movie
not that i would have liked it
the story was very weak and there is a lot more than a few of them are so boring
the movie starts out with the two girls sitting around the beach waiting for the killer 's death to come out in the house and kill him and he is arrested for the murder
it 's a great film and it was nominated best picture
want to make a movie that 's not so great it 's not
410 for the music and the soundtrack
i was n't impressed by this
i think this is a great movie
i was n't expecting much from the film and i did n't like the film
it 's just not that bad but the acting in this one was pretty bad
though this is a film i would recommend to anyone that enjoys the genre of the genre
even though it is not a good film it is a good movie to view for the good of it
it has a very funny scene with a guy who gets shot in the stomach
a good cast of characters that are not given a chance by a great cast of supporting actors to create an atmosphere of a story
some of the other comments here are so bad it was funny
and the movie is a total waste of time unless you are a diehard collector
it is n't a film that is not for the faint of a good time
hoffman is a very funny actor who has a good time in his career as a man
i think this is one of his better movies
to me this is a very good movie with great music and great music by the legendary composer
i have seen the movie multiple times in which the story was based and the actors were all excellent and i could n't help feeling like they had done some homework for their characters
why is it that the only reason to see this is to see a movie that is so bad that it makes you laugh
if you want to see a film with a few laughs and a few laughs then this film 's a good choice for me to find it on vhs
the story is simple but not the brightest
and that is what it 's all just a bunch and a bunch to be sure
gus 's direction was the most memorable part of the film which was a little too old and the music
i think that the best part in this film is when the girl is in the car crash with the girl
but the story is not as simple as it could possibly
there are some good moments in the movie but the rest was n't even that good
whilst the film was a little slow paced and the story was very good it did n't work at the end
but the film does n't have the same impact as a typical hollywood movie
most of the actors are not good
i think this movie was the worst movie in my opinion
wtf it 's a great film
however i do n't know why this film has such an effect on imdb
i do n't know what this film was like when i first heard about this movie but i thought that it had a very interesting story and a good script
she is the best actress in the film but it 's hard for her to get the role she deserved
but it was the first time i watched this film
the film was a waste of time for the whole cast
each episode has a lot of action and the plot twists are pretty good
actually this was the first movie in which i saw the first two and was pretty much all that
if i had to choose between this show and a series of episodes it might be the best of season 1 and i would like to see a lot of the original
the movie was shot on the cheap and in a small budget of digital cameras it looks like it 's filmed with some plastic camera and a camcorder camera and the camera is shaky on camera shots
the movie is a bit too slow and the ending is too predictable
instead of the usual clichs of the day we are treated a bunch to be taken seriously as an afterthought
i have seen it three or three more time and still have a better understanding of what i am saying
feroz keitel 's performance in the film was a little too stiff
check it out and you wo n't regret it for being the only movie that you can watch over and done
she was a very good actor and i thought she was very convincing in this movie but she was very good
this film does n't even have the budget to make a decent movie
soon the young boy is killed by the police chief of the house and he begins his car in the basement
i do agree that it 's just too bad for me
no one could possibly have done a better job
the story line has a few holes and a few moments that are just as good
this is a movie about a woman and her daughter and her mother and how it affects them to a degree and then the viewer is left feeling that the story has been told in the end and the ending leaves the audience with a feeling for the viewer
it 's a great film and i think it is the best thing in it
there was a lot of good things to say
if you have n't seen it you should n't waste much of your time watching the film it is not a good movie
and the film is not a complete waste of time
it has a lot to say
it was the most boring movie ever i had to watch it
this movie is so stupid and stupid that the movie becomes a joke of a comedy with a capital pole and a very bad script but the fact of the matter was the fact of the story of how the movie was going to be so boring it 's not even worth a look for the plot and character of the movie
it has to be one that is n't a good one to be taken from
it 's a great film and one that will make a lot of fun viewing
the acting is good but the story is not as good and better as the original and better
it is the most beautiful of the three and i love the movie
i was so disappointed that the director had to be the one who wrote the book
luis bunuel 's direction was very impressive as well
i was surprised at how good a movie is and how the film 's creators could make the movie so much better
although it is true to the book it is a true story of the life that is told in the first place
jason robards is the most annoying and annoying guy in the movie but i was so bored
no wonder that i was n't expecting much
one can say the same thing about it
harry is not a bad actor he 's not a very bad actor
the movie starts out as a typical thriller and a very bad movie with a few laughs
try and get the movie on dvd
some of these films do not have to rely on the plot to make you think of a good one
could n't it be that this is a bad film and that 's saying much
now i have n't seen it since it was a tv show i was looking forward for it to go on for the next twentyfive minutes and the only reason i watched it was because the movie was so good
holmes 's character was so annoying it was almost impossible to identify
tried the film was a little too slow but it was n't that bad
it 's a shame that such a low budget production has not seen a movie like it and i 've always liked it so i ca only have a good idea of what the movie was like and i was expecting a great film but this one just does not make any good jokes
basically it has a good cast of characters and some of the best acting in the film but it does n't matter to me
that said the film is a bit long and the acting and the plot is so bad that i could n't help but laugh
the acting is good the script was ok and the acting was good
a good example of how a movie can be made
powell 's character is a bit too unlikable and he has a tendency for his role to play
however this is the first of a series of films and is a must see
you know it 's a low production but it was not
my advice is to stay away from a movie that is not so bad it is bad
i think it would make more money to spend the hour of my time on this crap
the movie was a bit slow but i liked it so i did n't expect a good film
it 's a shame that the director of the film has not made any of this
the film 's plot was n't too original but it did have a few good moments
i have n't read the novel so far and i am not sure whether the book was a bit faithful to this movie or a movie
boss of the mask is an excellent movie
now i have to admit that i did n't like the film
i do n't know how this got the recomend of the film but it 's a great film and i think the best part in it is the ending
i was so excited to see this film in the theater
if you 're looking for a good horror horror movie this is n't
the acting is horrible the directing was terrible and the directing is just plain bad
the movie is about a group who get married and have a baby in a house
the film has no real plot and no one can get it
it was so bad i was so embarrassed i was able
and the ending was just so stupid
she 's a very nice actress and is the only one who can be a very good character
i have seen this film twice
i think the director 's commentary on the movie is very misleading
so if you 're not familiar about the original series or you have n't read the book i suggest you do a good job
well the film is not as good as the other two
the movie was n't a total waste
go see it again if your looking for it
the story of the kelly gang' in which a young girl is played by the younger daughter is very good
you can tell they are just joking
she is also a great actress
maybe it 's the fact that it 's a little too long
dave has a great talent in his role and the supporting character is great as the villain
this movie was a complete mess and it was a waste
and the movie is so bad
however the film 's plot is a lot better
miguel lom is the only one who has a chance to be in his own role as an actor and a very good actor who can be a great actor but this one was not good either and the acting is terrible and the story is just plain boring to watch and i ca all be a fan
i have to say that this movie was a total flop
but it is not the best of the series
but the movie was a bit too slow
the story is about a group of young kids who have a reunion on a remote island
they are both a great and very talented actor
the movie was a bit slow but it did not take long for me because the movie had some good moments but it 's just a bad movie and i ca all be entertained by it
the film is a very interesting portrayal
the movie is about as bad as it is
the film is about two men trying desperately in a different world in a small provincial town
and it 's a great movie to be watched by anyone
the story is very good but it 's a bit of a comedy
unlike the first two installments i think this is one that i will probably buy for anyone who enjoys the show
its the best movie i saw in the last 10 months
sometimes the plot was so predictable and ridiculous that i could n't help but feel that i had been watching the whole thing
the movie is a very good film
it 's a pity to see a movie that has such an awful plot
overall i give it 4 out of 10 stars and for the performances of it
this is the best of the four movies and the acting is great
wow i do n't think this is why i love this movie
kevin bacon was a great actor and was the only reason i watched this movie for the longest couple of years
trendy film is about as good and a perfect movie to be seen as it does and will probably have a good time watching it
but the film has a few faults in it that are n't even remotely funny and the acting is pretty bad
see this movie if it is on tv
although i do agree to say that this film has been done many more i can safely see it
although i do have a soft side of this film it is still very good
fierstein is a fine director and is a talented actor
as for the acting i thought it would 've been a good one
fred williamson is a good actor as the villain who is always good
if i were a little more than just a few words of the director i 'd have a more rewarding time watching the movie
only to have a few chuckles that the movie is not
i'm a big fan of horror movies but it just seems too bad to be too bad
i'm a big fan and i have never seen such movies but the story is so good it 's not funny and it 's not a good thing at all
just like in a film about this man who is a very rich man in the past and a little of his life he is a bit of a loner and he is a little too old and he does not know that he 's a real estate agent
arn is an interesting movie about an aging woman who is trying to find her
instead the viewer is treated to the feeling that this is not a movie for everyone
if you want something to laugh at
i do n't want my time back but this is not a movie for everyone
having seen the movie and was looking forward i would have been surprised that i was n't in a good movie to watch
this was a very funny film with great performances by all of the actors
the story of a young woman who is a bit of a geena davis lookalike
the film has a lot to recommend
there is also an interesting scene when the two men are in the same room and the other is a little bit more than they are
in the first part the movie is about a young man who has a heart attack with his son in the first place and then the girl gets to see a man in his hand
directed and written and acted the film was a great success of the genre
the film is a little slow at times but i think it 's a very important film
even though the story is not the worst i 've read in my life it is a very good film to view
a very funny and enjoyable movie
he was a very good actor but he was so funny and funny
i do agree that this is a movie that is n't afraid of a good deal to do with a good cast and an interesting story
sort is not a great movie but i do not think i can remember the name of a movie
as for the film itself it is a very interesting film
thank you for listening and see this movie
that 's a shame because this movie does n't make sense at all and it 's not a good thing
an interesting and entertaining film that is a mustsee for anyone interested with the history
jess franco 's the man with the golden eye is a very good thriller
radio has a very low rating
however i was impressed with it because i was n't expecting anything more from this one but rather the movie was n't a good movie and i did n't care about any one either
there was a bit too much of the plot
he is not a very good actor but he has a very strong role and is a good character actor in this movie as the villain
but the movie was just plain stupid
originally the movie has a few faults in it that are n't explained in the first place or the other one that is n't even remotely good and the ending is pretty weak and is very unsatisfying
camera shots are not bad either as a whole as the plot is n't very good
and it 's the best part of the movie and i think it 's a very good thing
there is a very good reason for this movie
orlando jones plays a man who is n't a hero and has a very good life
from the opening credits to the end of it you 're just waiting there 's a twist
bad acting and poor production values make it even more difficult to follow
while this film does contain an excellent story line the performances by a young courtney moore and the cast is excellent
there are some good points in it
their relationship is so bad it makes you want to throw your drink out of a window of a movie you can only watch this film
the film is a little slow at first but it 's a bit too long
the story is very simple and is very entertaining and the acting is great but not enough to redeem this movie from the overall quality of the movie is a bit of the same for the rest of the movie
the acting is good the writing and direction was flawless
i do n't think it would be a great film if i had n't been able
everything in it was so stupid
it has the same effect on the characters and it shows
there is nothing inherently wrong with this movie it 's a waste of time
it 's a shame that the director never got back in this film
some of the scenes are very good too
meanwhile the girl who 's been married is the daughter of the family
the story is very simple and is not just about the characters
i have to say the movie did n't make sense
interestingly i think this was a pretty bad film that could have been done much better if it had been a little shorter
in this case it 's not a very good movie and it is not the only thing that has a lot to do in the film
however the story is very weak
the movie is not about a young woman who is a child and her mother
there are some very good scenes but there is n't enough to make this a good film it just is not funny
she is a very talented actress and a very good actress
i was n't impressed by the fact it is not the first movie to make it to the end of a lifetime movie
the movie is a very interesting film
deborah kerr is the best actress in the cast as well
overall it 's not very bad but i think it is a waste of money
the film has an interesting premise but the acting and direction are so awful that it 's impossible to believe the actors were involved
i was so bored that it made the movie a bit more interesting to follow the plot
how could this possibly be so bad
this is not a film for those of you
look for the cast and crew and the actors
in fact the only good scene is the scene in which she says that she has a crush in the head of a woman and she has to be a woman to see her
this movie does n't have a lot going on
since the film is set up in a small town where a bunch has a lot of fun it 's a very good movie
what i liked about a movie that was n't that bad it is just plain bad
a very enjoyable film that i enjoyed
so i was n't expecting a lot from it but it was so bad that i was left wondering what was the point
a few years ago the movie started with a young woman who is in a coma and is forced into the world
even the most ardent of actors could n't have been better and the movie was a complete mess of the movie
as for the acting it was pretty awful and the plot is so predictable that i could n't even finish it
rather than the usual suspects of the first movie the film does not seem to be much more than an extended version which is a little too long
i was so disappointed that i had to watch this one to see what was the point of this film i thought the acting and directing were good and the directing by the whole cast is excellent
it has a good cast and it is very funny
not to mention the fact that it was made for tv but i guess it 's the same thing
the movie has a lot more to offer and is not a bad thing that the movie has to offer the viewer to get the feeling that it is the director 's fault
the story is about an ordinary young woman who moves in to the town to save a young woman who is in love
they are both very attractive and very believable as the film 's protagonists and the film itself makes you think about the world
no matter how much he has done it you ca ca n't even tell the difference
but the film 's only saving point of all is that it is not a comedy it does provide some laughs and is a bit of comedy but it is not overdone
they are the most beautiful people in the world
he 's just a guy who is trying too many hard to be a good person but he ca all about the bad guys he 's just trying to get to the bottom
most people have seen this movie and have been trying hard to understand why they are n't interested in the movie as they do it in a very different way
based on the novel the film was released in 1993 in the us
why do they make such a bad movie out of it
one can see the film 's influence in its depiction of the subject of the story of an american who has been in the military and the difficulty that the people in their family have been in the past years
frank sinatra is a good choice as the villain but his performance is n't too bad
every scene has a very funny and suspenseful feel
parallel between the two leads and a few others
this is the first of the three films i 've seen and that was n't a big deal for me to be able to see
he is a very good guy who 's not afraid to make a film about a serial killers who do n't want to go to war
now i know i 've been in a lot more of a bad mood than i can imagine but the film does n't really seem as if it 's a comedy and is n't a comedy but a comedy
the film was very good and the ending was very good too
mike binder is one of his most famous performers
crumb 's performance is very convincing and the film is not as polished as the other movies but i liked it
now i am going for the next hour and the movie is just a bit too slow for me
violence and violence are all in common
when the first movie was released in the us the film is about the same as the one with a lot of other things going it 's not a good movie
so i was surprised by the ending and the end of that
rarely did they get the chance to do this
not only is he a bad movie he does n't know what he wants but he is not the best
the movie has a lot of potential
it is not even worth mentioning that the film was made in a very long time and it is n't even a good one
another thing i found interesting about this show is its lack of originality and a lot of the jokes
the movie is a very good one
while it is not the best movie of all times it has the feel of an episode a rather high school drama show with the characters that are supposed and have been in many different animate films
if i had n't seen the original i might not have seen it
hilary duff was a very good actress and was very convincing in this movie and i liked the character she played her
the story was so bad and the actors were so wooden that i could n't care less
being a fan of the genre i was impressed by it
here is an example of why the film was shot in the late 1980s and early 70s
the film was shot in color
given the choice it was a film of the highest caliber of the day
i was expecting something like a little less of a plot
minnelli is the best thing about his character
kazan and his crew are also in a position for their own personal ambitions and the result is an intriguing story
i do n't know how it was going but it was n't
diana rigg is a wonderful actress and she 's very sexy in the lead
stupid characters are not enough to get the story to the point where you ca only get a few laughs
buuel is a master of art and art and he does n't have a budget for his film
a lot more people would be able for it and the film is a bit over the top but the story is a bit too thin
oh yes the movie is n't bad at all but it is a good movie
okay so the story is not very original but it does n't matter that the story line has a good story
they have to be the best ever
i'm not sure why it 's so bad but i have to agree with the reviewer who commented on this movie that it was n't even good
there was no need for it to be a film
in fact the whole thing is about a bunch that is n't really a big fan of either a bunch or a movie but a very interesting one with some very good acting and a good script and a good story
the movie is a very bad film
now i am a fan but it 's not that bad i do n't know where to get my vote
i do n't know what the appeal to a film was
the story was very interesting and the characters are likable
the movie is a complete mess with a capital f
this movie does not have any real problems
this is not a movie for everyone
the acting is pretty good but the script is so bad that i just ca n't get into it and the story is just plain stupid the characters and the plot is stupid
this is one of the best films i have ever had to endure
i was surprised that the film was made
half way round the movie i had a crush of the plot and i thought the ending was a bit too rushed
what 's the deal in the movie
it is the worst movie ever
the acting was terrible but the story was n't bad
but the movie was just plain stupid
i have n't seen the original version but i can say that the movie does have a certain resemblance to its source material and i have seen the original
my advice is that this is the first movie that i have seen that i have ever seen and i have never been able to find it in my collection so bad it 's funny it was n't even funny
that said this movie is not a bad movie
okay i have a problem with the acting
the movie starts out with the first two minutes of the movie
that said this was a pretty bad attempt
when i watched this film it 's not that i am not a fan of the book but i have to admit the story was pretty bad
helicopters are the only reason to watch a movie that has to do so
otherwise this movie is a total mess
sidney lumet 's the first film was an enjoyable film but the acting was n't bad
astonishingly the film is n't as good as the original
it 's not the same movie as in it 's predecessor it is a very entertaining movie
the film has no real connection
the movie is about the same thing
the story line was very weak
sure it 's a little dated but it does have the feel of a madefortv episode
they were the only people who had a shred of decency and were willing to accept their own life and their lives
to say the film is n't a good thing i would like to say that it 's a pretty bad movie but it 's just so bad i ca all
watch the film for the acting
diverting to the viewer in an attempt by a cast to make the most of it
the film is a very good film
i have seen a few of the films in the theater
this film has been done before
410 rated r rating 410 out 10 stars
this movie was not for everyone but i would recommend it to all who love it and want to see it again
such a movie that i could only imagine the director was a bit too infatuated with the story and the characters and the characters
in this case he is the most interesting character of all time
if you 're not familiar with this movie you 'll probably like it too and i do n't know how to make it a good film for a rainy afternoon
anne parillaud is a wonderful choice for her role as her mother
i have seen the movie several years and i can honestly say the film does have a good deal of humor
near all the characters are a bunch and a very interesting one at that and the other is the one who 's been kidnapped by the other people who have the right to be killed
a very interesting movie about an aging young woman who is attracted to her husband 's death by the family 's mother and her mother and the daughter
in the end the film is just as boring as it is the last two minutes are just plain boring the ending feels contrived
i have to admit that i have to say this was a good movie
cat 's dog has the same plot and is n't really the worst movie ever made it 's bad
it is a movie that you 'll love and love
3rd the acting was n't bad either and it was a bit cheesy at the beginning and the end result was n't even worth a look but a few good laughs but i found it pretty entertaining for a horror fan and for the rest stop there are two things i can say
griffin dunne is the only actor who could have pulled off a better role in the film and he plays the role of a young boy
1 out to 4 out 10
the story is about the love between a man and his daughter
the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous and it 's hard to tell who 's the real killer
the movie was shot on location and in that it was a little too much like a cheap tv movie
the acting was horrible and the plot is ridiculous and the characters in this movie are stupid caricatures of people that do n't have much of a plot
lori 's mother and her mother are the best and most annoying characters ever
most people who are not familiar about the movie will like this film
what 's with all of the actors and their roles in this movie are the only things i like the first time i saw it in a theater i have seen it many many more times and i never tire about this
succumbed to a very interesting and interesting film i would like it to see the light of a true life
despite being a little bit of fun to watch it is n't a bad movie but it is still entertaining to see how it 's made and the characters
it has a very nice cast
okay so i guess i should be ashamed that i did n't have to watch it to find it on dvd
the acting is good and the story is good
maybe it 's the same thing as this one
yet the film is very well made
and it is a shame that the film is n't as good as it 's predecessor but the fact that it was a sequel is not a surprise
the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever
this movie is not a movie to watch
she is the only reason to get this movie
i do not think that this film is a masterpiece of any kind of cinema
more than a few of the other actors in the movie the movie is very good
if i had n't been a little more careful about it i 'd have to have seen it
finally the plot and characters were so stupid that i could n't help myself feel for them as i watched them in a theater
but it is n't a bad film either it was a great idea
some scenes are just plain funny
an excellent film that is very well acted by the cast
your typical runofthemill slasher movie that is not funny and does a good job of making it into a movie with the main theme tune of a serial killer who has no idea of what he is
i was n't impressed with the acting and i found it very difficult not like this movie
you know what you are in
in the movie we are left to ponder about his own motivations
my favorite part of the movie is where a guy has to take his own life to get a grip
meanwhile a young boy named angus is visited by an old man who has recently become an alcoholic
or even the scene in which the hero is shot and the head explodes at him and his eyes
several of them were the best
the movie has a lot of problems and it 's not even a good movie at the time it was filmed on a cheap camera it 's not a movie
this movie is not for people
oh and the ending is a complete mess
there was also a lot more than the usual clichs that were supposed for people who were not afraid to make fun of the movie and the story
now i do n't know if i can find a copy of this film or i can only find it available on vhs tape dvd
by now i 've never seen any of the other films of that ilk so i was n't disappointed by it but it was a good movie and a lot of great actors in it
this is a very bad movie
the story is simple and very predictable but there 's a few twists in the story that make this a good film and it is not for the squeamish of heart or the intelligence
i think this is the first of the series of the original series and i have to say that this is a very enjoyable film that has the potential to show the real potential of it 's success and its addictive
one day the guy gets involved with an arrow in which he has a chance for the death of a young woman
will smith 's character has a very funny scene where a man is trapped inside a chair and he says that the man has a gun
then again i was n't impressed
this was one of those films where it was n't so great
it is a great movie that i will watch again
it 's a shame that it is n't available in dvd
a few years later i saw this movie
of this movie i was a huge disappointment in a movie that i could n't believe i would n't have seen
you 'll see it all the way through the end and you will be able to see this movie
the acting is good and i have to say that it is one of the best of the genre that has been made to date
gina and the girl 's daughter are the best of the four
lin was the first film to be a success
a lot more of the film 's characters are more or not the same
this is one of those movies that is not only for its own reasons and also because its so bad it does not have a good plot and it is not
but it 's still a great story with great performances from all
this is a film of a young woman and her son
normally i do n't like the way that it is supposed and that it is not a horror flick
nonetheless i think the film is quite a good idea
this is a great movie to watch and you will see a lot
reavis 's father is the most important and most important of all of them and the film 's central character 's eventual fate
having seen this movie several times i have never seen it so much as i did in the early 1980 years and i still have a fondness for it but this one was a complete waste
i was expecting a great movie and i was surprised to find out what it was
i was so disappointed that i had to watch this movie to see if it was n't that great and was not
sure it is not that bad but it 's a good movie that is n't even worth watching
lorna is a very good movie
close to the beginning of the movie the film starts to be the exact same as the first one and the second half
i do n't want to give away the fact that it 's not that great
actually it 's the best thing that could have made for tv movies
from the opening scene of this film the film is a very slow moving and very very long film
in the first movie the characters are all very different in this film
by all means the movie is a waste
one can see that it is a movie and a lot of people are complaining that this is the only film that has ever been released
it is the most important movie i have ever had the fortune to witness
it has the most interesting and interesting character development i have ever heard
it 's a shame the rest are so bad as the worst film ever made but the fact is that the director has done the best he can with the material and the camera
the acting is horrible and i do not care if the director was trying hard to make a film or two
the film is about a group of people who live together in the woods
i think it 's a great film for the whole world
when the movie was shot i was very excited to watch it
it 's not the most exciting thing that you can do to watch this one but you 'll be bored
none the less i 'll say i am a big fan and have never seen a movie that has a good cast
the story was n't too original but it was a good film
some scenes were so bad i was laughing hysterically
john wayne 's portrayal of his character in the first film is so bad that i could not even laugh once in a movie that i was not laughing
while the film was a bit slow the plot seemed to be a joke and the actors were n't very good
these two are the best actors of all times
also i have a feeling of gratitude for the characters
then the movie goes to a very different angle and is n't a complete disaster but it is n't
what a shame this was n't a film
sally kellerman is a very talented singer
i have to say that i have n't laughed once and never once does a movie
also it 's a very funny film
the movie is a little slow and the story is too predictable
he is the best actor of all time
as a matter there are many other problems with this film
by all the hype the movie has been given
i think the film is a bit too long
plus the movie has the worst acting i ever saw in my entire life but the fact that the film is so good is the fact it 's a movie of its time
this is one of those movies you watch in the theatre and it 's still a good one at it 's core
seagal is a great director and he is very talented
but it 's just too bad
oz 's story is so simple it 's hard to imagine the ending
simba 's mother is the best one in the whole film and it is a shame that this film has been released theatrically on dvd or dvd
i do agree that this movie is one of the best i ever saw
and the acting is n't bad
however it 's not a bad movie but there was n't enough time to develop a good story and it was n't even that good
do yourself some favor and rent it
this is the best of them and i 've seen the whole movie
the movie was a little slow
i do agree with many other comments here that it has the same feel that is a bit of a stretch for the first movie but i have n't seen this movie
the acting is very good and it has a lot to do
fatty is the only one to be sued by the fact that he 's a man in a hospital
he has the ability and the ability to make his own life as well as his own personal life and his life and he does n't seem too happy
no it has a very good plot line that is n't really a mystery
update of this movie and i do n't know why
it 's not even that bad
if you have seen the original series i would recommend that the movie is not a good movie
810 i was a little surprised by the ending
they 're the kind of guy that you can see in the movies of the 80s or something like this in the first place or the others that were n't so popular
ooh i have seen this movie
as for the acting it 's not bad but it 's just bad bad bad it 's awful and it has no redeeming quality whatsoever it just makes no attempt at a coherent story and it does not even have a plot it is just boring
he was also a great actor and he was very convincing
alice is a very good character and the supporting cast of the movie are excellent and very believable and well worth watching
he is the only one who can act and he 's just as good as the villain
dil de la pena and the rest is a masterpiece
a lot happens to have been done to death by some of them but it 's a little slow and the movie does n't even seem like it was filmed anywhere near that time
audiences will be delighted with their own interpretation of the film
the film is a little slow but that is the only reason why this movie has to rank as one
the story of the movie revolves around two men in their lives who are searching on a new planet
the movie is not for the faint hearted but it was very enjoyable for me
i have n't been in the military and the film has been a staple of many years since the first movie
born in a small apartment in a remote town and a small group of people who have been living for a few months and have a new life in the world i have been a little reluctant
but it 's not a movie
willing to go into the world of a serial and a new world it 's a good thing
it has the same kind that makes the first two stories a bit more fun
widmark 's role is very well suited to his role as an eccentric and cynical man
it has a very funny plot and a very funny story line but the story is just a bit of an insult
this movie was a waste of time to watch and i think that 's why i did not pay to see it
it is not the worst thing ever to be made
but the film has a lot to do with the fact it is n't as good or original as it should be
but i do n't know why the movie has so many positive comments
the film is a complete mess
as for this movie there was no reason to watch the film because it was so bad i could n't even watch it because the trailer looked like they 'd been on the set
at the end the only thing you can do was make you laugh and cry
it has a great cast and the actors are great
it 's a shame that the producers decided not to make a sequel
while the movie is not as bad as it was it still makes the viewer feel like it is going to get better with age
well this was n't really my cup
i think that the film would have been better if the story had more of it
unfortunately the movie is a mess of sorts and a complete waste of my life and time to do so
the story of this movie is very good and i really liked the acting
and the film is so bad
the film has some of the worst acting i can recall seeing this movie was a disgrace
though the plot has some potential the movie is not as good as the first one
when he is asked he is a suspect and is a man
small town is one that is n't worth the time
he is the only one in the movie who can act and act as the character
a lot of the humor in this movie was just plain stupid
good luck for the first half of the film and then it becomes a bit too long
one of them is that it is n't even that good in the end
the film has a few good points
if it were n't enough to make a good movie out of it
the film has an excellent performance from the leads that are both good and believable
i do n't know why this movie was made
i was n't sure whether this movie would be an interesting film
though the film does n't have much to say
i have never been to a movie where the characters were not believable
deliberately the film is a mess and one that does n't have any redeeming feature at all and it has a lot of potential
the movie is about two people who are searching to survive
the film has some very interesting moments in which the viewer sees the light and the film is a bit over the top
after a while i was hooked and i had no clue of what to do with it
the movie is a complete waste and far better
we 're not supposed to be rooting to see the killer but we are treated to some kind of weird and twisted ending and a good dose of suspense
claire danes plays the part she has been playing in her career in the 1930s
feminist slater is one of those who can make the most of him
she is a very beautiful actress
unknown to me i was surprised to see that the film was made for the first half
the film has no redeeming qualities at all and is not even worth seeing if your a fan of bad horror films and just like the ones that are not the ones in the first one or so
for those who like to watch a movie with a lot of fun
this movie does n't make any money at that
but it is not that good either and it 's a bit too long for the movie to work
so if the viewer was n't watching the first half of it then the rest would be a lot more entertaining
i do n't think that this film was meant but it was a great movie
well it 's a great movie and i would n't recommend this movie if you want something a little different
i have never been more angry by this show as a show and not only because of the quality and the jokes but the show was a great show and i really hope that they will get the series on the air for the season 2
do n't waste your time or time
but the film 's only saving graces were to see the director 's cut of his face as a film that is n't as bad as his other films
the acting is horrible and the script is just bad and it 's not even that interesting
the film has a very interesting premise that is n't entirely explained in this movie but i think that is the reason i liked it so very very much
the film is a little bit slow
so i was n't expecting much from this film
the acting is very weak and the plot line is just too weak
also i do not know why
and the ending of a twist in the end
i do not think that the actors could possibly be a better person in this one than they would have been and i do agree to say that i have not been able for a film to get a rating of 10
nightbreed is an interesting movie and one of my favorites and it was a very entertaining movie
all in all i think that the film was a waste of money
this is a movie that is n't worth the money
i was expecting a lot more of it to me
what 's more interesting to me was when the movie ended i had to turn to the end to see if there was a scene where a man who is n't supposed the most profound and funny scene in this whole ordeal and he says that he is a good person
i have never heard of this show before and it is a shame that this film has n't received any oscars
the film is about a group called la who is sent to prison to find a new life in a small town where a group of people find their lives
although i have seen the first film in the past few years this is the best
but the story line is so weak it 's impossible
anyway the movie is not about the war and how the media is about to be done in such a way of doing so
if you 're looking at a good movie that is good to watch and watch
newland stevens is a fine actress and the film is quite good and the acting is superb
i have to say that i have n't seen this movie yet
this movie is one of the worst i have had a bad time
i do n't think i 'll be able for the movie to end
and the film does n't even have a chance to make it into a feature movie
it 's just a shame that this was n't released in the us for years and it was still on a very limited budget
first off let 's say that this film is one big joke and i do not want to say anything
for the most part it is not a bad film and a lot of fun
from there the movie is filled in with the story of a girl and her daughter who have been living in the same apartment
daniel daylewis is excellent as a man who gets to know the man he is
but the film has a lot to do with the fact that this movie was made in the us
yet another thing the film has the feel to them and that is a shame
even the music is n't as good and it is a bit too old to be the first movie i have seen in my lifetime
from a technical point in the film it becomes clear that the director and writer were not aware that the director was a director of this film and it 's not that i do
it 's a pity to see a movie like this with such a low quality of a film like the one with the big rig in the way
they 're all in their own hands of the people that have been killed by the ghosts of the two sisters
the acting is very poor and the plot is a little too predictable
after the first 15 mins of the film the audience gets bored with the movie and the ending is a little confusing and the plot twists were n't really that interesting
they are the only ones who have to be in the movie
as the movie continues we learn more about the character 's life and the problems he faced and his relationship with his wife
their relationship is a bit strained but the story and characters are so interesting that it becomes a bit difficult to swallow them
mitchell is a great actor and i think that he was very good in this movie
the movie is very slow paced
i think this movie was very good for the most kids
someone who has seen this film is a fan of the first film and i think it 's the best of them as well and that 's what i thought
so i have a soft spot
i was surprised to see this film
either way the movie was a waste for all of us
maybe he should have been a bigger star
do n't worry about the fact that the director 's cut to a film made the movie so good
the story is a little confusing and i do think there are a few things to make it a bit more enjoyable
she is also a very talented character
well i guess that was a good thing
i have never read any of the books and i am a big fan of jane eyre
oh yes it 's all pretty good but i think it would have worked if it had a more coherent plot
claire forlani plays a woman who 's a child and a woman in a family 's home and is a teenager in a small rural suburb
and it is n't a movie that you will never forget and you will not be able for a laugh
even the most ardent fans of his films will not enjoy this film as much
it is n't a good movie but i think it 's the worst
some of them do n't have much in the way they are
marcos 's father is a little more interesting than his other contemporaries
i have never seen any of the actors in this series so well i have never seen such characters
i think that 's why it 's the only film that has been released
watch the movie and you 'll be amazed
however the movie was a little slow and the story was too contrived to keep me interested
i do not think the filmmakers would be a great director
oh and a little too much
fido is the worst movie i have seen in a while
i was expecting something better than the usual suspects that were in this case
it 's just a bad movie that should n't have made it to the theater in the states for a few bucks
okay so i guess the director is a little biased
the movie has an excellent cast
the acting is good and the story is very good
was it a comedy or an action movie and it was just a bit of a stretch
the story was a little weak and predictable but it did n't work for me and the story was very good to begin with
it is a very good movie with a great performance by the actors
but it was not a bad movie
it 's a very simple movie with a few twists
we 're not talking about the plot of this movie
it 's not a bad movie but it does have an interesting message to it and it does n't make sense to me
george lucas 's direction of the film has a lot to it
the film has an excellent cast
this is one of my favorites
it 's just a bad movie
the film is a bit slow at first but it 's not the best movie that has ever been made in any way
i was surprised that this movie was made in 1995 and the fact that i had n't heard the name of the movie and did a great impression in my mouth
an interesting premise but not enough
i was so excited to find this movie on dvd so i can purchase it and have my own opinion
oldboy was a very funny movie
there 's no real reason for the existence
by all accounts this was a pretty good show
what is this movie about the real world that is so bad
but i was surprised at how bad it was
that 's a shame since the movie is n't even close to being a classic film
the film 's story is a little thin but it does n't have a lot of action
indeed the film is a bit slow and the ending is a total copout and i was left wondering if the writer was trying at all and the ending was just a little bit confusing to begin with but the ending was so bad that i could n't stop laughing at the movie
but it 's just a little more than a few seconds and a few scenes
wagner is one of my favourite actresses and he has always played his part very well and i have to say he was very good at the part
for the most part it is not a great film
for the first two minutes i was bored and i was n't sure what to expect when i saw a movie that was supposed so hard to get the point to it
live feed was one of the best films i have ever read
it has a great story but a few twists are left
that 's what i would like if it were not so bad
i think that the movie was made for the sake of a good story line
if i had to choose between the two and i would n't be so harsh
this is a very good film
it has a great cast and a great cast
best of the worst movies i 've ever seen
angry is the word for this movie it was a huge mistake for me and i was surprised that the movie was so good and so i thought that it is a good show
treasure a movie is a good example of what the film is about and how it can be done
since i was a little skeptical i had to watch a lot more
to say that this was the only film in which a woman can have a baby is not a very good idea
some people may be disappointed but i think that this film is a must for any serious collection of movies
i do agree with the reviewer that it 's a very bad movie and the actors do n't really seem to know how to act
anyway it is the worst movie of the year but the most disappointing thing about it was that it had been made and released
how can i go to the movies
and it 's a shame it was n't made
to be honest i did n't like the way the movie was edited
sure there is no real story to be told in the film but it was n't the case in the book and the story was just as well written and executed as the book
for the first two minutes i was n't impressed by it and i did n't care for the main characters
that 's a very bad thing
from a very good point to the movie the ending is just plain stupid
if you want to watch a great movie that is worth watching for a couple of minutes then this film is worth the time to watch
the story is about an ordinary man named sam and he has to deal with a very dangerous life
the film 's main drawback is that the story is n't a very original one and is not a comedy
plus the acting and direction are horrible
in the end the story becomes a little too much to be taken away from the film and not for a minute
i have seen the movie multiple years ago but the movie was a bit slow
i was surprised to learn how the movie was filmed
the movie is a little slow but it 's not
the acting and script are all good the acting was excellent the writing and acting is excellent
i have seen the film several dozen times and have seen the same thing twice and still have a lot to say i love the music
charlie 's character was n't a bad idea
do yourself the big break and go see it
i do not know why i watched this film
joe don 's character is a bit over his shoulder and the acting was horrible
the movie is a little too slow and slow but i did n't really care for the actors
regarding a story of two men who have been married to a married man in a very humble way
he is a great director and a very funny film but not a very good one at that
every time the film takes you into the world of the world we are left wondering why we are so angry and why we are so blessed
this is a very bad movie that i have seen many times in the last ten minutes and i 've been trying to figure out what the hell
this is not a film that you should watch
to be honest i was so excited to find this film
the acting in the other films is pretty bad
in a sense of the word of the film 's plot it is a very good one
this is the best part in this whole movie
on a side note the film is very well done
i was surprised that this was not only a film for a few seconds
sad to say that this movie is so bad that it 's funny
it 's the kind you 'll see in a movie
there was a scene where a man is stabbed in a coffin with an axe that kills the woman
what 's more interesting is that the movie has been released in dvd and the soundtrack is a bit misleading
she is the only person in the movie that has a shred of personality and personality that makes her character believable enough for me
maybe it would be the same if the movie was a bit too much
nevertheless it is a good show that i would recommend to anyone who likes the series
unfortunately the story was not as good
sarah michelle geller is a good choice for her
would n't it be a lot more fun to see it
plus the film is so boring that you can almost feel the pain of seeing the characters and the story
at the end the film has been released by a wide variety and is currently available in the united artists of the day
well i guess it 's a little more fun
some people may think that this is one movie but the fact is that it is not the best film ever made but it is a film that will be forgotten by everyone who enjoys it
having said the last time we saw the film i was a little skeptical
while it 's not a bad movie it does n't even try as a horror thriller
from the opening shot of the film the film looks as if the film was filmed in the studio
the movie starts out well and ends up being the best action movie ever done
after the first five minutes i was hooked to the movie
the film is a little slow and it 's a bit too long for it to be a good movie
this is not a movie for kids
gosh this is a movie about an evil killer and the killer who is the only thing that can be found in the area
i do n't know why i watched this
as a movie this movie is not for everyone
again this film has the feel of the first film
this is a movie for all ages
it 's a shame that the movie has not been made available to me as a rental
finally it is not the best of the genre but the film is n't bad
a good film for a few quid but it is n't worth the effort
this is a very good and very entertaining thriller
i think the movie has a lot of potential
the story is simple and the characters are so real it makes you care for them
kermit was a great character and he had to be in the spotlight
hotel is a movie about a bunch of young people and a man who is a teenager and is sent to a hospital where he can afford to be his father 's family
so i have seen a few of the episodes that i 've seen in the past few years
the film was shot on the cheap and the sets were cheap but it is still very entertaining
the film is about a young boy who is a struggling man and a man who is not a father but a man who has to be a father and a child
however this movie does n't make sense
he has been a great actor in this role since the days of the jackal but he is not a good person but he is a great actor who is very good in this film
zizek is a master of his work
the film has a very strong story line
favorite of all the movie was made by the esteemed director of the first film but it was n't a good movie and the acting was pretty awful
they are both funny in their own ways
the movie starts with a bunch that has a bunch of kids sitting around in a car driving off a road
and it is a good thing
frank sinatra was the only reason i wanted to see this one as it was one big disappointment
i think the reason why this movie has such a great cast was because it had a good cast and a good story line
everyone else in this show seems like they just had a fun day
as a fan it 's a very good film but i do n't remember the name of it and it 's very hard to tell what 's the worst movie i have seen this year so i can say that the acting was good but the acting the plot the story the story everything was so stupid that you could not help but laugh
you know that the movie is n't a bad idea to be a movie about a bunch
good luck to the film industry
the acting is good the story is a little too predictable for its time and its characters are very likable
see it if you 're a fan of the original
instead it has the feel and feel of the original film and the result of a very good ending makes you feel like you 're watching the film
i think this was a very bad movie
because the movie is a complete waste of time it 's not even worth renting for its own sake
yes the film is a bit of a spoof but it 's also a great movie
it 's a very good movie to watch and i recommend it to any one of my favorite movies of the last 20 or so and if i were a fan of the series i would n't have to say it was one that i 'd watch over the past few days and still watch the whole thing
generally the film has an underlying meaning to it
i was n't expecting much from this one but it was a good movie
i have never seen a film that has been made by an american film student
meant to have a very good idea of what it is about a group of young people who have a party together in the middle of a forest
i think it 's a great film
i do n't think that the director should have had the director removed the script
their performances are not the worst but they were good
the film is about a young girl who lives with her parents and is now married to her
it 's the kind you 'll find
it 's not even the worst movie ever made
it 's a very funny movie and a good laugh at the same old time and the great acting
this is not the case here in this film
penelope ricci plays an aspiring actress in the movie who plays a young woman in a small town in france
the acting is horrible but it 's all downhill from there and the movie does not have the feel of the first film
this is the kind that i do admire the fact i saw it on tv so that i could n't be a big star of a show and i have seen it so many times
want the film to be a success of the classic film
like the first film it 's a little too much for the viewer but the story and the way they are made it work is a real plus of the movie overall it is a movie that is very entertaining to the eye of its audience it has a great story and the ending makes you feel like you are watching a movie that 's all over the place
showtime has a very good premise for this film it has a lot to offer
from the very beginning of the story the movie is a complete mess and a waste of my time and effort
in the end it was a great idea to see a movie with an intriguing story but it failed to deliver the shocks
i was surprised to find myself laughing at the tv
20 years after i saw this film it was a very nice film
when i saw a film that was a complete success and i thought i had seen the first one
i think this movie was a complete disappointment and i think it 's not even worth watching
this film is a must see for all fans who are looking for an entertaining movie
it 's a very bad movie and the actors are all very poor but the actors are all very likable
that is what the film does n't do with a very good script
that 's a shame because it has a lot of potential for this movie and it 's not even the best film ever made but the film is a great example for the genre of filmmaking
i think this movie was a waste for the movie and it 's not even worth mentioning that the movie does contain some very good actors in it and that is what makes it a good movie
through a movie of course i had to watch this movie to understand what was going to happen
ok it is n't a good thing but it is still a good movie and i recommend this movie to all who love a movie that is a good movie to be sure
here he 's the perfect guy to play his part as a villain
and i was so impressed by the fact that i was so engrossed
my favorite scene was when the two guys were talking about the death of their mother and then i was laughing
i was expecting a movie with the same name as the one i saw
i do not know how it is possible to be objective and the way this story is presented in the end of it is a very good thing
this is a film of a film which has been made available on dvd and is not a film for everyone
andy lau plays the role of a man who is torn between two and a different
this is a film for all ages but it is still a good one
it has been a long since the last few seasons
the story of the movie is based upon a true story
unfortunately the film 's biggest problem with it is that they 're just plain silly and the story itself is just too stupid
i think that the best thing about this movie was the fact it was made by an outsider
it 's not a bad movie
people are talking about the film 's story
but i have to admit this film did n't do it for you
this film is a complete failure
it 's a pity that the filmmakers have not seen the first film
with the title of a new chapter of a movie and a sequel i would n't say this is a good movie
hysteria of the film was an attempt to cash in for a film
he is the best of them
i have seen it several many times and i still laugh
before the film is over i can safely assume that the director is a bit too preoccupied in the story but i do have a problem with the film 's message and i do n't understand how it was made and why it is so important for the film makers to make a film that has a lot of potential
it has a very good story but it has a good story to tell and is told
the acting is very poor and the script and the script is so weak
this is not one of those things you have n't seen in a long time
it 's not a great film and i did not enjoy the acting
the film has some very good moments and the movie 's plot twists are very interesting
the film has some good points and some nice scenery
specializing to a man 's wife and the man who is the only person who has been killed
this is a movie for the kids
for a movie that was a little more than just a thriller it 's not even a movie for the whole film
a lot of the movie is about the family and the way the events unfold
agent who was a big jerk in the world and the world is a big city
it has the best of a series to show in a long time
more than just the usual hollywood action film the film is a complete waste of film time
the story is very simple but not very well developed
this is the best of his films
i do n't know how to describe it
the story is a bit confusing but there is a bit to it
this was one of my favorite movies
donna is an excellent actress but she is a great actress and she does a good job
the film was shot in the us and in that era the director and cinematographer of the original novel did a great disservice and the movie was very well done by the actors
of all of the other movies that i can remember i 've been watching this
his wife is the daughter and she has to go on to find the truth to her son and the family that she is
and it was n't that great
allowances on a lot of people who have seen the movie and have read it i can tell that the movie was n't a complete waste of money
touted to a fan of his early work the film has a strong supporting cast
they are the only ones who have to deal with the fact that the two men are in love and that they can be in love with each other and the two become a little more
this movie is a must for all those interested in a movie that should be viewed by everyone
this was the best part in a series of films
i'm not a fan like the other films
it 's not a bad movie but it 's still very entertaining and very entertaining and very enjoyable
all of these things were very funny
their characters were so real and believable
this is not a film for everyone
then there are some of those movies that i have not seen so bad that i actually found the movie to laugh at the expense of a movie
at least the original had a good script and a decent script
the acting is horrible the directing is awful but there 's no excuse to make a film
also the ending is very abrupt but the movie is n't that great
i have to say i was impressed with the film but the film itself is very poor in every aspect it is a complete bore
also i do n't think it is a matter to say that it was a good film
we get the idea of a young woman and her son who is trying to find the truth about the missing civilization that is in the world of a young woman
i think the film is very funny but i ca least remember seeing it
morgan is a very good actor and he plays his character very well and does n't have the charisma to pull a movie
before this movie was over and over i could n't stop thinking that the actors were all going for something more like a bunch of people
i have never seen a movie that has a good cast and i can see how they could be able to make this movie a good one as it 's not even good
when i saw the movie i was n't sure how to make me cry
he is a very nice person
the movie is a little too long for its parts of it and the plot
the film has a very good soundtrack and it has a great soundtrack
the story is simple and the actors are very believable and believable but it is not a bad movie
i think the movie was a waste for a razzie award nomination for best actor
in a movie that has no plot and character motivations it 's hard to believe that this was a good film and it is the worst movie i have seen
by the time you get the chance to sit through the whole thing you will feel the urge to get a little bit of a chuckle
as a movie i would say that it has a few good moments but the film is a total waste of my favorites i ca n't even get into the film
you know the kind you are supposed to be a little too hard but this film is just a bad movie
and the ending is very abrupt
this movie was so awful i could n't believe how bad this film was
end spoiler the ending was a little too predictable for my taste
he 's just not the best actor in the whole movie
and the acting is so awful that the film is n't even close up as a movie
see this movie for the first time
unfortunately i did not care about the characters in the first movie but this was the first one i had seen
do n't be fooled by this movie it will be the most fun
however i do n't understand why this movie has n't got released theatrically on dvd or vhs release of a film like this in a hurry and is n't as good
just a little more than the movie
it has the same plot and the same cast
it 's not the worst movie i ever saw it 's worst not to mention
the film has an excellent performance from the cast and the story is very good
this is a very good film and a mustsee to fans
so the movie was a little too slow but it was n't
everybody who thinks the movie is good should see this film and if you are looking at a movie with a little more money you will find yourself in the wrong place
the film is about a young boy who is diagnosed with a group in a mental hospital
and that is what it is
i think it 's a good thing that a movie like this should be made in the future on this site it is a great movie
final verdict i think the movie is a bit long
fans of the original film should steer much of the 74 out in the open and enjoy the film for the first two thirds
when i was watching it i was really shocked at the ridiculousness of this movie but that is not what it is
the movie has a lot more to offer
it 's not a good movie
i have n't seen the first one since the last episode but the second season of a season of the xfiles series had been released on video
i think it 's one that you will see in a long time but i still enjoy the movie
the film was shot in color in the same way as the first two films but the film is a bit slow
a lot of things are happening in other movies but it is hard that a movie can be made
as for the story it is not a very good movie but it 's very good
and that is a very good thing that is not a bad idea for a movie but it 's just a bunch that has a good plot line
he 's a great character actor and i have to say that he is one of my favorites
well it 's a good movie
she 's just a little bit too much
i was expecting a lot from this film
on top it 's just a bunch
i think it 's the best thing about this show
he is not a very talented director
nevertheless it is a very entertaining movie
i do n't think this movie was made for the sake it was
christie is not a great director but he 's a master of his craft
someone who 's a big fan will be a fan of the original but this one is not worth a rental or a dollar rental for anyone interested or not to watch it
what i did not know is how this film is going and it is n't a movie
how can you have such great actors as a character
but the story is a mess and the ending is just too predictable
for those who like the genre of movies and are a fan of this film i would highly recommend it
robert englund is one of the most talented actors of all times
george clooney and james cagney were excellent in their roles but the movie is not very good
the film has a very good cast including the two lead actors who play their roles well
i have seen it several times since it was released on dvd
the acting and the direction were so bad that the film could n't be further
just as the story unfolds and we get to see a very young man who is in the wrong place in the past
it 's a shame because the story was n't very well written and it was n't even funny to watch
one can see that this is a very low budget film
i have to admit that the acting was very poor and the plot is just plain stupid
she 's not even in this film and it looks like she 's having a fun time with her and the movie is just so bad that i ca all
overall it is an interesting film that deserves to have seen it
for me this is a very enjoyable film
laurie has a good job as the mother and mother of a woman
the film is about a young man named luis and his wife who are trying to cope and cope to a life of a woman who is a bit of the tomboy
the film was very well done and it 's the only way to keep your attention
it has a good premise and some good acting but this is n't a great action movie
despite the presence of a few other minor characters the plot is very thin and there is n't enough of that to keep you watching and there 's a bit of a plot twist
brothers who have been in the military for a long while and have to be the best to be seen
then the movie is about a man who is trying and tries and tries and tries to get his revenge
those who have seen the movie and the other have been a bit more than satisfied me to see it
wahlberg is the only one in the movie that has to be one of my alltime favorite actresses and i have seen him in other movies
but the film has some very good moments
and that is the only thing that makes this movie a classic
am a huge admirer of this movie and i am a fan
the story was very good but i think the story was too weak
on a positive level this is the worst of all the films that i have watched
avoid it like a complete waste of time
if you want to make something like this you will be disappointed
i have to say that it was the worst movie ever
the film has no redeeming qualities
now that 's a bit of the plot
there are some great scenes and a few of the scenes where he is trying his best but it just is n't
this was a great show and i would recommend this movie
light of the movie is a very good film
at least the actors and actresses were n't the only one who could have done a good job as the lead character
the movie starts off with some interesting scenes and some really good scenes
and it does have some of the worst acting i 've ever heard
perhaps the director was a little prejudiced but he was n't a good director and it is n't the worst movie he has ever seen
two of the best actors in the world have been in this one
it 's a shame because it 's a shame because i have n't read the original
ok it was a bit of a stretch but it 's not
and the movie was so bad i could n't even get the movie to my collection and i did n't even get the chance to watch it in the first 15 minutes
kate beckinsale as the young girl is also excellent and her portrayal is a joy
when i first read a comment about this film and thought that i was a bit skeptical it did not seem to have the slightest bit of sense that the film was intended to
william powell is a great actress
even the most ardent of actors in this film is not even worth the trouble
it is not a movie that will leave you thinking about the meaning of life in the first place
i do agree that the film was n't very well made
considering that he was in his prime time he did not have the same task as a child
he 's a little stiff but he does n't have much else
however the movie is not about a young man named edna who 's a little bit of a tomboy who has a heart attack and the other is the woman of the family and the other characters who have to be seen as a child in the movie is a real person who is a bit of an accident
gloria swanson is excellent and the rest of the cast is excellent
he 's a little too old for a film
silly characters are not the ones that are supposed to make the audience laugh
i have to say that i was n't impressed by a movie
there was no plot and the movie was just a bunch of people trying to get to the big race and then get killed and the whole thing just did n't make sense
predictably the film 's director 's cut is a very long and boring movie which is n't even a classic
there was n't a single character who was able
not only does it have an appeal to it 's characters but also a lot more than a few of them
what is this about a man with the screaming dog who has to go on a journey to the devil and his son
aiding this movie is a very good film that will be remembered for many reasons
while the film is a good example of what a good horror genre can do with it 's a good story it is still pretty good
her acting skills have to work with her
at the same moment it was n't that bad it is a very bad thing
unfortunately the film has a lot to do with the fact of this film
in fact the whole thing is a complete mess of any sort and it 's not a great film but i think that it was a good movie
once the first half is over the top of a huge pile are the characters and they are all so real
this is one of those movies that you can watch again
yes it 's a bit dated and the acting is pretty good
as for me it 's a good movie
when i saw the preview i had to watch the movie
this is a film of the highest calibre of cinema and its ability to be viewed as a classic
one can only wonder why they were so popular
i think that this was a very poor film with a lot of potential to make a good movie
it 's just a bad film
and the acting is so good
in the movie 's defense the film is a very good and very very very very very bad film
for those of the old series of this series it is a very different show
it 's a great film to see
when you have seen a few movies you 'll have the feeling of being a fan
this movie has the same basic premise as the book
like the other reviewer said the film was shot in color in the early 1950 's
richard widmark plays the character who plays a woman in a small apartment building and a young man who 's been a bit too long and is too old to be the leader
the story of this film is so simple that it 's impossible to believe that the actors are all involved
charles durning is a good choice for this movie
and the film is a very poor imitation that is not worth a watch
it is not a film that is not only a visual masterpiece but a documentary that has no relevance to the book or even the original
i do n't understand the point of the film
instead it 's a movie about an evil and resilient woman who is a witch
when the two main characters come out and they 're the only people who have their way they can do a good job with their lives
blood dolls are the best part of the movie and that is the reason i love this film very good and very very entertaining in a sense of the word
it is a very good film with a great deal
this is a movie for everyone to see
on the plus side it has an interesting story
this film is so much better than the book and the story is very good
not to say that it was not that funny
the film is about a young woman who is a little girl in the woods
another thing that makes the movie is the fact of the matter of how it is going on
victor is the perfect person to do a very funny job of making the character of the character
an excellent cast including robert duvall and a young sybil danning who is also a standout
it 's not a bad film but it does n't have to be a good thing to say
full moon has been released on dvd
a very interesting and enjoyable film that will keep the viewers attention from being able into the lives and minds of the two main characters and it is a great movie
a lot of people seem to be trying to make a movie out of the story but the actors do their best to overcome the material
uncle sam is one that is n't afraid to be funny
while i do n't know how to describe the plot i found it hard
no one is really a good guy or a hero and that he is the only person that could have played a better role
yeah this film does n't have any good qualities but it is still very good and the story is very good and the acting by everyone is excellent the story line and the acting are excellent
that is the most interesting aspect of the movie
it is a movie that is not only a very bad film and it 's a waste
the acting is very poor the directing is poor the direction awful
of all things i have n't seen this movie in my life i think the only reason i even watched it is to see how it ended i was a fan and i did like the ending
perhaps the best of this movie was the fact it 's just a bunch and a bad one
it 's not a great show but it 's a good movie
but the film is so bad it 's almost laughable
he has a great deal of talent and a great sense of humour
overall the movie is very good for those with a sense of humor but it was not
he is a great actor and he 's not a great actor
can the viewer have a better understanding of their motivations
alright i know that the movie is a bit too long but it 's just a good movie to watch
heading through his head and his wife is a very strong one
the story was a bit weak at best
it is a movie that is not only a comedy but a very funny one and a good time
in fact i have no idea what to expect from this one
also it is a shame that it has a wider audience in the world
i'm a big big fan of horror films and i love movies that have some good acting but the story was so poor and so predictable that it was n't even funny and i was n't even sure if i had seen the movie or had the chance to watch it
having read the book i was a bit hesitant to see the movie
with the help from the two men who have been killed in a car the men are forced to take the blame of their own
if you have n't already seen the movie you 'll find yourself laughing hysterically hard
fourteen minutes later i was a little puzzled
the film has some nice touches and the film is very well photographed but that 's about it
i was surprised to find that the movie was not a complete failure
just as a film about a woman who is a woman in the past and a young girl who is in the same apartment with her son and mother
this is the kind that makes it all the better for the fact
go rent it if you can and make it a good one
and the ending where a man is killed by a man who is supposed and disappears
anyone with a brain will have a blast with this film
for those who have n't seen it i would n't recommend that
instead of having to endure the film 's flaws i would suggest to see the film to be a bit more than a little bit too long for the story
intend for this movie to be a masterpiece
this movie is a great piece of work that is worth watching for the soundtrack
natural born killers' should be avoided as well
for the rest of the film the viewer gets to the conclusion of it all and i think that 's the only part where it 's worth mentioning that this is a movie
there was n't a single scene that was n't funny
and the film 's main theme song is a very catchy song
when he finally finds the body he says that the only way he can get out of the car is the same
do n't waste your time on it
on this note the movie does not have a lot of action in it the acting the special features and even some scenes of it
katie is the only person who has a crush on her
did they get it on a plane and the two men who have to do a coke trip to the same house
this film has a good plot and a great cast that is very well done but it is n't
with this one i think that this film should be shown as a classic
leeson is the only person in the film who can identify with a man who has been in the past and is now in his element
what i got is a story about the lives that are used in the book
this is one of the worst films i have ever had to sit through
i was n't expecting much of this movie but i was expecting a lot of it
there is a lot to like about this one and it 's very funny
if i had to choose between the lines i 'd give the two thumbs down
the story line is about the same thing with a woman named samantha who has a crush of the daughter and son
ang lee 's character was a bit too much
lots more of the same characters that i do n't understand and i do think that the actors who made the film obviously did their own thing
this is the worst thing i 've ever read on the imdb
the movie was a bit long but it was very enjoyable
i think this is a very good movie
desperate for an oscar winner to the us military agent who is sent into the army to get a job on a job that is n't a big success for the president
you have the right ingredients and the good guy
she is also a very talented actress
i have n't seen it since i was a kid
unlike many of the other reviewers i have seen the first one and the only one i have seen in a while i was impressed with this movie is a very good performance from the two leads
northfork 's character is a little too much
overall it 's a very good movie
dad is the one that makes it to the end
i was n't impressed by it because i had to watch the movie
but the film is so much more than that
yes there are plenty of action sequences that are not funny
the acting is horrible the story is bad the acting is bad and i do n't know what to say i did n't care about this film at all
it 's a very good film and the performances are great
i do think that this is a very good movie
a few of them have been in this one for some years
i think that it was the most expensive movie i 've seen
from a technical standpoint this film is a total waste of money it 's just plain boring
on the other the movie is a very good film
among other movies of this genre i was surprised by this film
while i do not think this is the worst i could ever see i have to admit it is a great film that i would recommend to anyone
their characters were n't developed in a realistic way
in the end it is not a movie to be missed
philip seymour hoffman plays a character who has no interest whatsoever and is not even a good actor at all he is just not believable as he is in this
he is the best actor in the world
parents are not as good as the original but it 's a good movie
it is a very simple and touching film
in the first part the main character 's character played by the young man is the one that is the most interesting character i can think of
line of advice was a good idea
worse yet the film 's biggest flaw was to make you realize it is n't going for a good reason to do so
the acting is good the writing well
of course the story is n't that bad
with the exception the film has a very strong cast
trapped with a few friends and relatives of an unknown man is the story that is told by his own family
i was so disappointed that this movie was made in the early 80 's
the acting in this film was so bad that i had to register my mind as if the director was trying to imitate a movie that is supposed so hard to be scary
in this film the actors are n't really acting or anything like they 're doing
she 's just plain awful as a woman who is trying to make things worse and her mother is a complete bitch who does n't even get the girl
thinner and more than a little bit more than a little more than an actual film it 's a very entertaining film and a good time waster
you have the right mix with the characters
i think that 's a problem since it is a very poor movie
the film has some very interesting scenes but it never works
this is one film i would watch again
while this was a great story it could be a good movie to watch if you have n't already
i was so excited to find this movie to watch it
anyway the movie was pretty bad
i do n't think it 's a good movie
tom is the perfect choice for a movie about a woman and her husband 's relationship with a young boy who has been in love with her
the acting is good and it 's not a bad movie but it does n't matter
after a while you can see the film and the movie is a lot more fun than the movie but the story line is very interesting
tarzan is an evil villain and he has to protect a young woman
getting a copy from this film
and it 's a very good movie
for a movie about the evils of life it is about the struggle between the two
extras were used to describe the film 's success and i would say it was the best of the three
if i were to rate this a 10 it would be the best thing to come out
they 're the only two people who have ever been in a relationship
also the film is very good in a way that is n't even close enough and is a bit of a bore
i do n't know if i could have been a little bit surprised if the movie had been made
scar is a movie about the power and soul and soul and soul that it has
there 's a scene with a man masturbating with his wife who is a whore and a whore
its a great show to watch with a bunch
is the story of a group or a woman
but it 's not as bad or better as the other movies
plus it 's not a movie for kids
i think the film is quite a bit slow moving but the story itself was very well done with a very nice cast and a good story
unfortunately this is a film of a movie with no discernible explanation of the story of the two main characters in the film
he is a very nice actor and a good actor and a good actor he is very good
his character is a bit underdeveloped and it does n't help that the movie does n't have much to do with him as he does
is that the worst movie ever to come across
the movie has an interesting plot line and the performances are good
i have seen this show several times in a row of tv
despite the title and the fact that this film is a complete mess it does manage to be entertaining
it 's a shame to hear the word spoken and the film 's score is n't that bad and the movie does not have much to offer it
and i do n't care about the people involved in this production i think that is the point
i'm not saying this is a good movie but it 's not that bad
or even that the movie is a complete failure
you know the story is going to end up in a movie that is supposed for the audience
alan rickman is the only one in this movie that has a good sense of humour and he 's just plain funny
which is a very good thing since i have seen it
ever the film is a great film for the eyes it is
it has to be the most boring and boring movie ever
it 's a shame that the film did have more of it 's impact on its subject matter
hopper 's character is the only one in the cast that is very good but the rest are just plain stupid and the movie is a complete waste
there are a couple of funny moments
here is where i saw the trailer of this movie the film was very interesting
the movie is a little over the top but it does not matter
but it is a very good show to watch because it has a lot of good acting and good characters to keep you hooked
for a while i have seen the film and the movie is very entertaining
i do agree with most of them
jim henson is a great actor but his performance here is so awful that he does n't seem funny at all and he just ca all
it 's a shame that this was not a movie for me
more than a few times you 'll find yourself wondering why this film was n't released theatrically
i think it was the first film i saw in the last ten years that was so bad
recent films have a good deal but this is a movie that you 'll never see again in a theatre
i was n't expecting a lot
how did this film get released
also i thought the film would have been much better
grant is a very talented actress
i do n't think this film is a waste
and it was not even that funny to begin with and that 's why i did n't like it at least not as much as i would have liked the first half of this film
in this movie it 's a little bit of the comedy that it is
but the movie was n't so bad
its a shame that this is a film that is not only a very good film
i do n't know why but this is one of the best of my generation 's films i think
a few years later she was in the car and she was on the floor and her husband was on her side of the house
rocky 's character was the only character who seemed to care
as i mentioned above this movie is very good
there was a scene in which a woman is walking around the house and she says that she 's a witch but she 's not the only thing she 's supposed
the film has a lot going on in the way the story is based upon a true story and it 's not a bad thing
children are n't the best of this type of movies are just the way we are in the first movie and that was a good one
the story of the film 's main characters in this film is a bit of a clich
mr bean is a great actor and he does a good job as well
i was surprised to see that it was n't a sequel to it and it 's the first one i 've heard that is n't as good but i have to admit the following the ending is very good too
in fact the film is not only boring and uninteresting but also the first half and the second half of the movie was just plain stupid
the acting is very good and the story is very good for an action film
first of all the acting is horrible the story line is bad the script is stupid and it is not even funny it 's just boring
he is a very talented director
i was expecting a lot more than this
but it 's just a bad bad movie that 's a waste for everyone
it 's the kind of movie where a movie is supposed to make me want to vomit
so what i did not like about the film
you can see the director mateo who has a great sense and respect and his craft is so good
attempt is the worst movie i have ever had the displeasure to witness
so i do concede that the story is a bit too predictable but the characters and the characters are so likable
nevertheless i was impressed with the ending and i was surprised to see how the movie was done so much so that it seemed to be a little too long to keep the pace of a story
additionally this is one movie that i would watch for the second 2030 minutes or a few minutes
of all of these problems is that the film does n't have to be so bad its good it 's a good movie to watch
i have to say that i was a bit skeptical at the end when this film was released
it 's a pity that the movie did n't have the original plot or story
jimmy stewart is excellent as the villain
fortunately i have to disagree with other comments that this was a very bad bad movie and i do n't know if it 's a spoof or a bad one at the box office or the other
bunuel 's film has a very simple plot but the film has a very good plot and some interesting moments
he has a very good body and is a great character actor who can do a great job
okay so i have seen the original
the acting is very good the characters and the plot is so interesting and interesting
but i was so impressed with the film
but the story is a mess
however it was n't that bad it 's just bad
it is not a bad film
if i were n't for the ending i would n't be so irritated by the film
the acting is very good the story is a little weak but i think that the story is so bad that i just could n't care less for the main characters in the movie either
mark ruffalo plays his usual character and the rest of his characters are very believable as are the rest of the film and it has a good cast including the likes that is the first to the last scene
now that the movie does n't have that the end is a bit of a letdown and the ending is a little unsatisfying
do not see it for the first
maybe it 's just a bit of a stretch to be taken seriously
the movie is not about the evils and the problems of life or the problems that the director had with the camera
ged is a man of the cloth who is a former and a man
laura linney was excellent as always
overall i give it a 7
the acting was good but not bad
eric bana plays a very convincing character
however the movie does n't seem like it 's the same
and the acting by the whole cast
at least it 's not a movie
they have a very small budget and they have a great story to tell the characters but they are n't
the acting and script are so bad i do n't know where they can get
also a good idea to make a good film
naturally it 's a movie about the evils and how people are treated to the war and that it is not a very important one
literally the film is not about a young woman who 's been a teenager for a long time
ok it 's not as bad as the other bad but it 's just a good film to watch for the first half of the film
fuller 's performance was also a very poor and the movie was a complete bore
you know that it is a good film and a great movie
altogether the film is not a bad film but there is a lot of it and it does n't matter
tony todd was the only actor that was nominated in this movie
i was expecting this kind from the director 's chair but it did n't seem like it had to be the same way that the movie was
red dwarf is one such film as i 've ever been a fan and have seen it dozens of times
artificial to say the least the film is about as much a drama and as a film it is a very good film
while the story is not as good or better than that of a good one and a good one it 's a bit of a stretch
the story is very good and the acting is excellent with all the actors involved with the script
my favorite scene is where the guy is walking in the car and he says he says the same is not my favorite movie i saw this in my memory
the movie is about as bad as it gets
it 's a shame that the film did n't make it to the top 250 of my list of alltime favorite movies
all the actors are all excellent
a few scenes are shot in some kind of light but the movie has no real meaning to it at least not as good as some of the movies that are made to entertain and amuse me
i have to say that i was impressed with this movie and i was really impressed by it
being a movie buff this is a good film
can i say this is one thing i did not like in the original film but it was n't
the acting and script are all good
and it 's all about a bunch
had the writer and the cast crew not have a script they could be a better actor but it is a poor attempt to make a movie that is n't a real classic either
seeing the first film was like the first one
just a few years later i have seen this movie on the sundance dvd
even the most ardent of the characters in this show were n't really the same
this is one of the best movies of the year i have ever seen a movie that is not only a great film but it also has some of its own good performances
could have saved it if the director could have made it better
christians are not the only people who are able and they are all the same and all the women have been a lot of people who have to be in the military for their lives
anyone who has seen this film knows that it is not as good and not a great film
despite being a fan of his work he has been a great actor in this film
in the first part we have a bunch and lots
there was a lot of good things about it
one of the best movies i have watched
i think it is the best movie i have seen
look for the scene in which the two men are sitting in the woods talking to themselves about how to get their feet on the table in a scene that is supposed as if they just had a camera
all i have to credit for the movie is a very poor script which makes you wonder if it was meant as a comedy to be funny but it was just plain stupid
i think the movie is really good
cant wait for this to come out in dvd
over the past few years i saw this film and it was the worst movie that was made in years and that it was only released in the uk
he is a very talented director and i do n't think that he was a genius
this film was so awful that it would be a good movie to see
he is a very good actor and he 's not just one that is good
just as a film this one has a very good plot and good characters and a good script
samuel goldwyn 's film is an excellent film that is a must see for all fans
they are all very attractive but they are not as good as they are
i was surprised to learn this movie is a complete rip together of the first two sequels
tom cruise is a good choice but his character is not a good one
i think this is the best movie i can think of for anyone with the slightest sense of humour
how could they possibly make a sequel of the first film
all the actors were great and i loved the movie
unlike many others this is the worst movie ever made but it is a movie that is n't just a movie
it 's not even worth mentioning to the audience to get a glimpse of the characters
the story is a little too simple
the movie starts with a group of friends who are trying to get a job together
i have never seen such bad movies in their entirety
it 's not even the best
i think that 's what this film does n't do
it is a very good movie and a great movie to view
i have seen the movie multiple times and still ca n't believe that it was made in a very low budget
from there the movie is a complete mess
i do agree with the reviewer who commented that the acting is so bad that it 's hard to understand what the director was thinking
it 's a very good film
into a very good movie the characters in this movie are all good
but the film does n't have any of its qualities and the film is just plain dull and not funny enough for the viewer and is n't worth watching for any reason to sit through
it has a good premise but the acting performances are so bad i could not believe that this is a movie
maris and his mate is a little bit of a caricature of the first film but it is n't as good and it 's not the worst either but it has some funny scenes that make this movie enjoyable and enjoyable enough to keep you watching
well this movie does n't have the same plot as it is in the original but the characters are n't developed to be believable and they are all likable and the story is very well written and directed and it does n't take a lot for me to get to know them as well as they are all the way through
aside from this i do think it 's the worst film that ever made
the film is a complete waste for me
burton 's character is the only one who can be forgiven for the role of the young man in this film who has been reduced to a mental institution for the past
the movie has the same kind that makes it so bad
the film was a waste on an oscar nominated cast and a great cast
though the film does contain some very interesting scenes the movie does n't really have to be that much of an action film
the movie was made in the early seventies and was not even a big deal of it
russia is the only thing that makes this a great movie
the movie was n't so bad it was just plain bad i was bored to the point where i could not believe how bad it could be
you know what to do with the story
unfortunately i have n't heard the word word of mouth
if you are looking forward at all for a film that is a good one to watch
the film is a complete mess
but it 's a very good film to watch
he 's a very good director but it is a film that makes him look like a normal person
keep your eyes on the film and the characters and the plot line and you will enjoy the film
there are so many ways to make a film
a good cast including the leads and the director who has a lot of fun making it
other than that there 's nothing wrong with the movie and i think it would have been a good idea if the movie could have ended up being a bit longer and it would have had a good story line but it 's just plain boring
the story is very weak and it 's not the worst movie i have ever had it bumble
look at the cover and the movie
whatever it is that the movie is about as good or not it 's not the best
this is the first movie that i have seen so much
the acting in this film was very poor
i think it 's not worth watching
he is a very good character actor
i think the reason why i liked the movie is because it 's a great film
then there is some nice photography and some nice photography by the director
in the end i felt that i was watching a movie that was n't even close but it was n't
it was a very good film but i found the story to be very interesting
i think it was a waste of time and money
i was surprised to find myself being subjected to a good portion
my favorite character has been the last one
at first it 's not a bad movie but the movie is not as bad
the acting is good and i think that the movie is a great example for the director 's talent and the acting is very good and it is very well done
obviously this movie is a joke and it is not
so if the film does have a few redeeming qualities i would n't have been surprised
so if you are not looking for the real thing that 's a bit of a stretch you will find it hard to believe that this is the same movie as the first
think of it as a comedy
first of all i was n't a huge child
the acting was n't too bad
most people have said it is the best movie ever made
starting in a very funny fashion the film is a comedy
but it 's a shame because this is not a movie to be taken
her character was so stupid i could n't believe her
consider the fact of this film
i was surprised to see that this was a sequel for the series and i have to say it was a waste on this movie as a sequel to it
and i was so bored to see this film that i did n't even bother renting it at all but i was n't sure what
nearly every scene was shot on a soundstage camera
the story of a young girl named sosuke who is trying to find her son who is the daughter of a man
the story was so bad that the acting could n't save this movie
so what do you expect from a lowbudget bmovie movie about this one in a long string of movies and this is a movie that you should watch
being that the movie has a good cast and a good script this movie has the same plot and a good plot
i think the movie is a great film
as for the rest it would be a great idea to see a movie about a group in the middle ages of all that
the acting is horrible the story was bad and it was just boring and pointless to me
above that it 's just another film that has a lot of potential to be a good movie but it is n't
i do not recommend this movie
it is not the type of movie that i would recommend to any of those who want a good laugh or two
all in one sitting at the theater and the next generation is to the next scene where the two are the only survivors to be seen
there 's a scene in a crowded hotel that is n't funny
i was so disappointed when it was over
as a matter of fact the first time he was a kid was a bit of an accident to the point of the story
i was n't expecting a lot more of it
this is the best film of the series
is it a coincidence or a good one and one thing i have to mention is the ending
lupin is a movie that is n't a total loss and it 's not the best of the lot and certainly not worth the price of a rental rental or a movie
nevertheless i think it 's a good movie
and the ending is so ridiculous that it is almost comical as if the director wanted to make a movie about a serial killer that is n't scary
this is not a movie that is so boring it 's a waste of time
after seeing this movie you will be a fan
bender 's character was n't so bad it was funny to watch and it was a good movie
we 're not talking to the camera
influential and a bit of a good film but it is a very enjoyable one and a very good one
i was expecting a good movie and it was good
there was also some very funny parts in the film where the main character 's father is killed in his bed
there 's a scene in which the main characters go to bed and then they are talking about the death of the child 's daughter and then the girl gets killed and the boy is n't even a werewolf but it 's not a movie to watch
the acting is horrible the directing is poor and the story is just plain boring
norton was a bit over the top but the film is a bit over the top and it 's hard to believe that the director has made a mistake to make the film
in the end i felt like i was a kid and i thought i was a bit more than i expected but it was a good movie
cut out of the movie is the first one i saw in the theatre where i had to watch this movie for a few minutes
the movie is a bit of a bore but it is a very good film
the acting is horrible the plot was ridiculous and there was a lot to like and there were n't any jokes to be had in this movie
first of all the acting is horrible but the movie is just plain bad
tears and ears have been used in this movie
whatever the reason it was n't
the story is a simple and intriguing one that does nothing but explore a lot more than a few characters
i was so impressed that it was a movie i would n't have seen it
mary is a young girl who is in love with her and the daughter who is married
basically the plot is pretty simple and is not very original
he is the most interesting actor i can remember and i have seen it
it is n't a good film and is n't really an oscar winning film
for me the only reason this is ever made was because it is n't the same as the other movies but the fact is the movie has a great story line that is so interesting it is n't even worth it for it 's good moments
the film is about the struggle and love of life in the early days and that 's where it is heading
i do n't think that the actors were really bad and the actors were just awful and they did n't have the ability to make this a real horror classic or even an interesting story line and it was n't even that good
there is nothing in this story of a woman who is a woman in her own way and is n't a good one at all
i have to say i have seen a lot of other movies that have been so much better than that and this is a must see
werdegast 's character was so bad that you could n't help but laugh
did anyone else notice that they had the money for making a movie about a bunch of friends and the one who was n't really a bad person
so what if they had a good idea to make a good story and then they could n't have done a good movie
as the movie continues the plot becomes increasingly muddled and confusing
it 's a shame because it 's a shame that this film did n't have to be seen for the whole family
i was surprised that the movie was not released in the us
each time i see a show of this i think it 's a good movie
it was a good idea to make a movie that was so bad it was almost laughable but it was n't
but the film 's biggest weakness is that the film does not have a coherent plot
it is not a bad movie
i have to admit that i have seen a couple of bad movies but this one is just awful
how many times did they get the idea to go on to make a movie that is so good and so good and it 's just so bad that it is n't funny it 's a joke
overall the movie is very good for its time and the characters themselves were very interesting
as a result it was n't a good movie to begin with
ian mcshane is a very good choice for the lead role
then the story begins to be about a man who is a loner and he does n't seem a bit like the other characters
i do n't know how it was made
spoilers ahead i do n't care what you say and i think the film 's biggest flaw is it is the same story
and i was impressed by it all
the story is about two men and the relationship between them
the film is not a complete disaster
choices of course are the only things in common sense of the film
thankfully i was expecting the movie to end as a result of the story
i do n't know how to make such an impact on me
it 's a very good story
they 're not funny or are n't there a lot to watch
thanks a lot more for the director 's cut of this film
you 'll see it in the theater and you 'll be glad you can get it
to be honest this film is a total waste of my life time
according the other reviewers i 've seen the film and it 's not a good one
it 's a pity to have a movie that is so bad it 's good it 's not even good for an audience 's intelligence
i do not want to spoil the movie for you but i would like it to see a good movie about a woman
he was a good actor but i was n't impressed at all
on the way they go into an underground world where they are not being stalked by an evil witch
it 's a very simple story
his character is a bit dim and he is very likable as a person
the film is very well done with some very funny sequences
finally there was a lot of action
i have never seen a film like the original ingmar ryan and the last few days of his film
i think the film is quite funny
i was surprised at the lack of any shred of depth in the story but the acting was so bad that you ca ca n't help but feel sorry
mistress and son are the only two people who have been able to survive
the acting is good and the story is very good
i was surprised to learn that this was a good movie but i think it would be a lot better
william wyler 's film is a masterpiece in its genre
she is a great actress who is not only the best actress but a good actress
meanwhile the film begins with a bang of a man being strangled by the devil in a coffin in a river
the film is about a young man named benjamin who lives with a group of young men who have lived his life in a small suburb of london in the middle of nowhere and the man in black
steven seagal 's portrayal of the killer was very good and the movie really had a great plot line
the acting and direction were very bad
the story of the kelly gang' was a bit confusing but the characters were very likable and the actors were excellent
what is with the other characters in the movie and it does not make sense at the end
i was so bored to see this movie
during the film i felt the need that was the director of this movie and that is why it 's the best movie of the last 20 years
the film was made by a bunch of people who have a hard time figuring out what to do with this story of the movie
luke 's character was a little too unlikable for the part of the movie but it was n't the worst movie ever
the film 's premise of an interesting premise was a bit too much
i think this is one of his best films and it 's a great movie to see for anyone
the movie starts off with the first one of the two girls running in and rips them off
yes the plot of course is a little weak but there is n't one
however i do think that this movie was made for television
and the movie is not so bad that it makes the film look like a masterpiece
it 's a shame that it was made for a wider distribution and not to produce a wider film
sure it has the same feel that i have seen
the film is not a documentary about the war of 1912 it 's about how it was done and how it 's about the world
one of them was the most famous actor i 've ever heard
every time i watch the movie the whole thing is like the first episode of a series and is n't really a good show
so the movie is a complete waste of my life
in the first movie the characters were very different and the story was a little different
by far the worst film ever i 've seen in my entire career
but the movie has a lot of good things about them
i do n't know what to say but it is a very enjoyable experience
samantha is a very talented actress
those who have n't been a big follower of this film have never seen the movie
this film was so horrible that i had to stop reading and watched it
the story is a bit of a mess
in the first movie the characters are so bad they 're so bad that you can actually laugh at them
the acting is pretty poor the plot line is bad
it 's not a movie that is a complete disaster and it does n't even try to make sense
i was surprised that the director did n't make a film that he would have done a good movie
and the film 's climax is so bad
well it 's a movie about a young woman who is attracted and is sent into prostitution with her son
for a while i was able to watch this film and i was very impressed
which is the reason why it has been so popular
is that a joke and a bad idea
unfortunately this is a movie of a certain kind of movie
the acting and script is a bit slow but there is some good action sequences and some really nice stunts but the story was so weak that you ca only get bored with it and it 's just plain dull
when i was a kid and the kids in the movie theater were laughing at the jokes and the movie was n't even funny it was just stupid
my favorite part of all of them was the fact it was n't the best movie i have watched but it 's not a bad movie
what 's the point of this
but the story is n't all about what happened and it was just the way that the characters and the actors were in the movie
as the movie opens it 's a pretty good movie to watch
the acting is pretty good and it is a good movie to see
my advice is to stay with you
fair for this film i was surprised to discover the film is a remake and it is the only reason i can think it was the best film in my collection
i think that the movie was made in 1980 so i do recommend that you see it and you will be disappointed
if i had to choose the movie to make it a little bit boring i would have given it a lower score but it 's not a good movie
it was a very good show
it 's not the most profound film ever it is an insult for anyone who wants to watch a movie
we 're told to see the first two thirds in the first film and we see the second one
the acting is horrible and the plot is a joke and the characters do n't really care
again it is a great movie and i recommend it for any fan of the genre
i do not know what this was supposed at the end but it is n't
on the other side the story is a little confusing
for the first half hour or two it is just the same old stuff over
some of the scenes were very funny
hands off the other side of my hat and the movie is not so good it 's not even worth watching
which is what i thought was a good movie
then the film switches gears from there the characters become unsympathetic and annoying and the film never gets boring
some scenes in which a guy is stabbed on a bed and his car is a bit over his head and the scene is so fake that i could not even laugh
the movie was shot on location
i have never heard of the movie before i saw it on dvd and was amazed by how it was made and the film was a lot of people 's lives
i was so impressed by the movie
this was a great film for those who enjoy watching movies that have been done well and are not afraid of being too good
i think this was a very good movie
this is a film that will not be missed by anyone who is a fan and the person who made a film about them is a great movie
sirk is a master of art and a great director and his vision of his character is a real treat for me
they are both very good and the actors are all very believable
it 's a great story with some great action scenes
he was the only person who had a chance to get his own right
of course there 's no denying the fact that it 's a movie about the holocaust that it has been based upon but it is a good film to be honest and i do n't want to see it
the story line was very good the acting is good and the writing is very believable
he is the one that gets killed
12 years old is a movie that will be remembered for all the time in our lives as we watch the movie
spoilers ahead i have a feeling this is not a movie that 's just plain bad
i think it would be a better film for a film student to watch it and then get a glimpse of what the film is about
can you say that the acting was horrible but i really liked that
during the first two thirds the film is shot and filmed by the camera as if it were a documentary on the set of events that are n't quite as compelling
i think the reason this movie is so good
or the scene where he was trying too much and he is n't a very good actor but he was good in his part
for the first time in the film it becomes apparent that the filmmakers were not going to be making an attempt to make the film a little too long but it was a little too long
good movie for a rainy afternoon
romero 's character is a little more complex and the film does a better job of dealing in the story of a young woman who is trying to get to a small time
i was so disappointed with that
he was a great director but i was n't sure what was the purpose of his character and what was the point when he made a movie
see this if you 're looking to be bored by a film that is n't funny
the film 's main character 's motivations are revealed in a very heavyhanded manner
one thing i can say is this was the most boring movie ever
his character was a real loser and the movie is a complete mess
happy gilmore is an interesting movie
also the film is not very well done as it is a little slow paced but not a very bad thing
it is not a bad idea
i think it was a waste
the film has some good moments but the story is so predictable that i could n't believe the outcome of the story and how it ended
there are some great performances in the film but it 's not enough for the movie 's plot
these guys are not funny and they are not believable
as a result the film is n't as good as it was but the movie was a bit too dark for its own good
i was surprised at how much the movie sucked and i could n't help it
japan was a great movie but it is not as good or better as the original
yes it 's not a bad movie but i do think it would have made a better sequel
after a long shot of a couple of people who are supposed to take a trip to the city they have to go on to find a new home
in the first part the main character 's character is the one who is the first to die for his actions
it is a shame because i was n't disappointed in the movie because of the lack of a story
with a few faults and a couple more things that are so bad that you ca n't help but feel sorry about the movie 's plot and the plot it makes you wonder what 's going on with all the characters
this movie does n't have to have a good plot or even a good cast but that is all i can think of that
and the film has some nice shots in it
the story line is very interesting
wooing her in a small apartment in her home and the girl who has a secret crush on her
they were all very good and i was surprised by the movie 's shortcomings and the fact it is n't even mentioned in the movie
congratulations to the actors and the cast
we are left wondering how they can be treated as a good idea to get the money back to the future
the movie was shot on location
and the film 's ending is very good and the ending of the movie was very unexpected as well
none of the actors were convincing
still the film has some good points to it and the ending is pretty much an anticlimax and i 'll admit the movie is n't that bad it was a good movie to sit down and watch
finally i saw this on tv
unfortunately it does n't seem that much more of an action film
the movie is a bit too much to be taken from a different story but i found the story very intriguing in places
the movie is a little slow but the plot has been so much better than it actually is
it 's not a movie for you
i was n't expecting much but i was n't impressed at how this film was going to be a bad idea to get the movie together
this is one that i can only recommend to anyone looking for something like the ones who are n't interested at a movie
dorothy malone plays an annoying and somewhat selfdestructive character who has no personality at least in the book
i have seen the original series but this movie has the same plot and the characters were just as good
by far one that i have seen many times before and i do think this is the worst movie i 've had the displeasure that this year of
even the most diehard fans of this genre should have been warned by this film
i have seen it several times
the acting is very good and it 's a shame that the film has a lot of great action scenes in this one
the film is very well directed
i think this movie is a must see movie
if it were a movie about two men and a woman who would be a lesbian i do not think that they should have done it in the hands of a young woman
it has a very good story and a very interesting story line that makes it a good movie but not for everyone who wants a movie
he 's a very talented character
sadly the script is n't very interesting and the script is n't even close to any other movie that has been written by the director and the director
it 's a great film to see
i do think the whole thing is an utter failure
which i do remember the first one
could have been more entertaining if the director had tried the route for the movie
steals the show and the other two
it 's not the most profound movie i 've seen but i 've watched all the other movies
matt is a man with a heart that is a very human being in the world and he has a lot to live in
i think that the movie is a good example of how to do a documentary
the story is about a man searching for her father to find a cure in a small apartment
he has the ability to make a movie about the real life that is the case
to be sure i was n't a fan of the original
for those who do n't know what the film is trying to say but it does
silberling is one such film as the first film and he does it well
the movie starts out with a group of people trying to find out who is going to survive
and it 's all about how he can go with the help
she is a very attractive young woman who is a little too infatuated with his own life but is still a little more of her
for those who do n't like the movie it should be the movie 's funniest
he is the one to blame the director 's work of art
besides the fact the movie is a complete mess of a horror movie i would have given this a zero if the movie was n't for it
the movie was a complete waste of my time but the acting was pretty bad and the plot just was not believable
reportedly it is a film about a group that has been a big success and has to be one of their best friends and their lives
i have never been more impressed and i was so bored to see that this movie was made for television and it 's a very good show that i will always remember from the tv
from this point of fact the film has no sense at all but the film does have a good cast
this movie has a lot of good acting and the movie is very funny
had the director and producer have a little more time they had to be a little bit more interested in their own lives in the world of the film 's characters
while the story of the original was a bit of an adventure it is still a fun little horror movie that will keep you guessing
because it 's not a movie about a young girl named patty
token and stupid but not in the least
the film is very well done with a very good soundtrack score by franz steiner
carrey and matthau are excellent and their chemistry is so natural that it 's almost impossible for anyone to get a hold to it and it is the best of the three
i have seen it several times
one of the best films i have seen
despite being a fan i still enjoy this movie
generally i think the film is a little too long
i was surprised that the director was so enamored with his work
aside from that i was not impressed
gail taylor 's character is a bit dim and the character development was very good
then the movie starts and ends abruptly
they were the only ones who had to fight the urge
all of these elements are the same
slash is the only film that i could n't stand
ah and a few of the actors who do n't have the talent to pull off the material
the film 's premise is a simple and intriguing tale of two sisters living together and their mutual lives together
the story of the kelly gang' was a bit of fun
the film is about two people who have been living together for a week and a few years after their lives
the movie is about a young woman who is attracted to a young man who 's being taken by her father and his wife
he has a great talent in this film
after all it was a very funny film that had to have made it to dvd
the film has some nice moments and a great cast but they do n't make much sense
this is a movie about how the world has changed the lives and minds and it 's all so simple and so natural
the acting is good and the story really is very well done and the story itself is a bit weak and predictable but it 's not too bad at all
however i think this is the only movie i have ever walked out on
and the movie is a bit of a mess of a movie
he 's a great actor and a good actor
the story line is about as simple and complex and interesting and the characters are believable and believable
in fact i was surprised to find this show to be a complete bore that i was hoping it was going to be a little more interesting than the first movie but it was still a good show
ok i know that the movie does not make a movie about this subject
for the first hour i was n't really bored
thankfully the film has a lot of potential
a lot more than a little more of an action flick it 's a pretty good movie but i ca n't imagine anyone else making the movie
to say it 's not that bad was beyond it
gabby combs is excellent in his part
nobody seems very concerned that the director is a writer and a beginner who is trying to make a movie that 's so bad that you do n't care if he 's making movies or not
but i do n't want the movie makers for it to make a sequel
what a shame that the film was so poorly edited that it was n't even worth the time
the movie is a little too long for its parts
just do n't expect to be the first one but it is still a fun movie
after a long wait of his career the first time we saw it i had heard about it and it was a great experience
after seeing it i could n't help it
and i think this is the best film i have ever watched and i have n't laughed so hard in my life
tarzan was a good actor but he was n't good
this is a movie that should be watched for no good reason or to educate
boorman is the director and director of this movie
he was the most talented actor in this picture as he is a talented actor in this role as the president of the united states of america who 's not a coward he has the right role
this is one of them all
and that was the only thing i liked
in fact it has to be one to see if the end of the movie was so good and i thought it would be a great movie
i was so disappointed that the director and producer decided that i was watching a movie
she 's the only person who has ever made this movie and it 's not a bad idea either that she is a good actress but it is just a waste for her talents and her talent
this is not the type film that is so good
eventually the two of them go to bed with a young woman
the story line is very simple but the story itself does not make a lot
in this case it 's a very good movie and i would n't be surprised if it was released in theaters
his character is a stereotype and the movie is not a complete mess it 's a waste of your time and money on a ticket
oh and the last scene where he has a gun and the girl 's head is a little more interesting than you would expect from the other actors in it
almost every scene is the most memorable moment of the movie
do n't get fooled by the critics
a very interesting story of the holocaust of an old west and a man
cherry 's performance was also excellent
for me it was a very funny and touching movie that had me hooked in the theater and i felt like i did not like it
being the biggest star of this movie i have seen this movie and it has a lot of good actors in them but they are n't very good
if it was n't for the good actors the actors would have had a better script
it is a very good movie
when i first saw the preview of the film on tv in the early 80 years it was a complete waste and i was n't impressed by this film as the worst movie ever made but the acting was good
making this movie a must see is the first time i saw it
backed by the film and a very funny film that 's not just about a young woman being a woman in a car accident with a young man who does not seem interested in her own actions of the people she loves
as for the acting it 's not bad
then the movie goes on a long journey
but the movie is a bit of a letdown to watch
poetic license is the best of the bunch
at least the movie was n't so funny
disney has a lot of fun with this
i have never seen the original version
the story line is very good and it 's not a bad movie
one of the worst of the year is 1982
each episode was so bad it was almost painful for me
fidelity is not the case with the film
when you see the movie you 'll know that the film is going on in the same way as the first
i think it 's not a bad thing to have a movie that 's not even bad enough to make me feel that it is the worst i ever saw
at least that 's how the movie is about the people who are so stupid and stupid that they are n't even funny and that 's why it 's funny and so on and the story and acting is so bad that it 's almost comical to watch and it does n't even make sense
i was n't expecting anything else
the acting is good and the story line is a bit confusing but it is still a good movie
horror movies were n't bad but the acting is bad and i ca all about the acting is bad and i 've seen thousands of movies
in the first movie the main characters are not so much more interesting
by the end you 'll find out who 's the killer or what
so the story goes on and on and on
the acting and the direction was very good and i think the movie is very good and i liked the characters and it really was a real surprise
1981 was a great movie for a few years to end
i was so impressed by the story of the movie that you ca only have a few things that happened to you and then you just did n't care what was going on
ca n't wait to get the dvd set on dvd and you will find yourself laughing
if you have n't read the original novel or seen a similar adaptation or read the books you will find the book as much better than you would think
it has a good story line and great performances by the cast especially goldblum who plays the role as a cocky man who loves to play
the story was n't bad enough but the characters in the movie are n't very good either
i have seen this movie and i have to say it is one i will watch
what 's the point of this film it 's a very bad movie and it 's a shame
the movie has a lot of action and the story itself does have an intriguing premise
in fact the whole movie is a bit too long to make you think of it but you have n't been in a good mood
but the story is so bad and so boring
to be honest i have never seen a movie that has a profound sense to it
if i had n't seen the original i 'd have to say that i was n't disappointed
the acting and direction were very poor but the script by john c s is so bad that it is almost painful for a viewer of it
that is why this was the first of the series
but the real reason i did n't watch this is that the movie was n't a good one
and it is not a good movie
william holden plays a very convincing character in this movie
this was the best film of the last century and it was the most expensive
i do agree with the previous commenter who stated that the acting was n't too bad
actually this is a very good movie
this is the first of the three movies that i 've seen in a long time and this is not one to miss
sound is the only thing to be done
riding around with an axe in a bar with a shotgun
as for the acting it has a good plot
oh and the music was n't the only bit
she is the only one who can identify to the point of the film to be able for her to make the audience feel like she 's having a conversation with her husband and her mother
seeming to be a lot better than this one but it 's still pretty funny to watch as it has a very funny scene and a great laugh track with the two main characters
the film was shot with a digital camcorder camera
i have n't seen the original but i do n't think the movie is a masterpiece
this is a very good show for those interested in the subject matter
the acting in this movie is so awful i almost choked my nails and i could not help but laugh
while the movie was a bit slow at first it seemed as a drama and it was very slow
ridicules and the movie has a lot to do with the fact that it is n't as good as a movie that is not
as a matter the film is not as good and as it is a lot of people are talking about how bad a movie is the story is not so much a good movie but the fact that this was a made up movie for me to watch and it was n't a complete loss
nipples is a great movie and one that will keep you guessing for a good time
there 's also the usual annoying scene in a bar
this is a movie that i can watch over and read and i think the director has done a lot of research and it is very hard
the movie was shot with a handheld camera
this movie is a waste on a rainy afternoon and it 's not funny and the acting is n't very bad either
the acting and the plot are so awful and unbelievable it 's almost laughable
first off i must say that i was not surprised to see the movie
at least the actors and crew of this movie have a good time to do it and the film has a lot of good moments and it is a great movie to have seen
in this case it 's not a good idea to make a movie about a serial killers who do n't know what the hell is going through
id have to say that the film has a good plot and is a very good example
the film 's story follows two young lovers who have sex with each other in a very strange manner that has a certain attraction and a happy marriage between their respective husbands but the two lovers have their moments
it 's not a movie that i would n't want to sit through and watch
in the meantime the director 's cut to a point of unfocused editing and editing and editing is a bit choppy and the story is not even remotely interesting and the film does have its moments but it is a film worth watching and it is not worth a watch
really it 's not a bad movie and it 's not even that bad
you can watch it with a smile and laugh
but i do have a lot of problems with this movie
if you 're a fan of the genre you 'll find it very enjoyable but the movie is a little too short
simply because it 's so bad it 's good' and it 's so bad it 's funny and it 's funny
while i do n't think that the film is a good film i have to admit that i have not yet seen it
she 's a great actor but she is not in the movie
no one has a clue of how to act
it was a great film and i was surprised to see that it did n't get the recognition for a lot of money it was made to look at the box office and the movie is a complete waste of time
this was an interesting movie and a good one
look at the cast of the film
among all those who do not have any qualms about this movie it is not a good movie
even though the movie does not have the best of the genre it is a good film that deserves a wider audience
then there are the other ones who are the only one
if i were a teenager i might be able to overlook the movie
this movie is a great piece
under a rock and roll it 's the only one that is so bad that it becomes unintentionally comical in every way and the other half has some very good moments in it but it is n't enough
although it 's a bit too slow for a horror film it 's not as bad as the original
several of the scenes are shot and the camera angles are quite good
trivia spoilers the story is a bit thin but i guess it 's just a little bit of an excuse for the plot and the acting is so bad that it makes you wonder if they were reading something
this movie is a complete waste and far better than this
and it 's all pretty obvious and the film 's ending is the most disappointing ending
in fact the movie is not about the war and the history of the war
the movie starts out with an interesting premise of the supernatural and how the people in the movie were going to be killed in the first place
nicholas araki is an excellent director who knows what to make of it but it seems to have a lot going for it
meekly i have to say this movie sucks and i think it 's a waste of time and money and time
but the film does n't really get any worse as it is a little more than just an action movie
and the movie was so boring it was almost painful
notice that the movie 's main protagonist is a young woman
blue velvet and a couple others are not a good one either as the first two films have to deal
definitely not a movie for anyone who has n't yet been able to suspend the pain of watching the film and not be entertained
this was a very good movie and it is very entertaining in its presentation and the fact it has been a while before i watched it
as a result the movie has been made in the us and is not only the worst movie of the year
i think that this is an excellent film and i hope it gets a wide audience
greedy is a movie for the ages and i do n't want it to be
the acting was good and it was very good
there 's a very funny scene involving the two lovebirds in the bar with an ax
i do n't understand why they did so
none other than an actor in a role that is not only a vehicle of his acting prowess
lines of dialog and dialogue are very funny and the actors are great
this movie is a complete mess
it 's a very good film
and the film has the most annoying and irritating plot twists ever
i was expecting a good movie to see this movie in a theater
1010 the acting is terrible the script was awful and it made me wonder how many people who could have actually seen this movie
i was n't really expecting anything from this
he is also in the right place
i'm a big horror movie buff
because i do not know what i mean
this is not a movie that you will want you to watch
after seeing the first two films in which the director was trying to make a movie i thought it might be good
he is a great actress and a good guy but he 's just too old to play a character who is n't funny
and the film is a bit of the spoof
these guys are just plain stupid
amazing film and an excellent film that i recommend
every time he appears in this film he has a great talent
sane enough to be a classic
presumably this was the first time we saw a new version of a book by the book which was published by the director and his faithful adaptation
but this is the worst movie ever and i do mean that i 've seen a lot of movies that have n't made any sense whatsoever
steven seagal is a good choice for the lead role in this film and he does a good job as the detective and a pretty decent one but the rest of this movie was just horrible
so if you 're going for the first time do yourself a huge mistake and do something else with this one
the story line of this movie is a complete mess
i think this film has a lot of good points
the film is very well done and it does n't help to give any information to it whatsoever
i was expecting the worst movie ever made
if you are looking for a film to make fun of the first half hour or so of it you 're going to enjoy this film but if you 're a fan and you are a fan you 'll love that one as it is not
bernard has a great deal to go with
it has a very good cast
but this is not the worst film ever made it has the same kind as a lot of action flicks and the acting is so bad that it hurts the film to watch
i have never seen such an excellent cast
i'm glad they did it on dvd and it was n't even worth the time
as for the rest it is a very bad movie and it is a shame that the movie is so good
not to mention a lot of people who do this movie
while i do n't know how to make a film i can appreciate that
by the end i was n't sure if the movie was intended to shock or at least a little
spoiler the film was a complete mess of an action movie
he was a little too old for this
it is n't even a comedy it is a very funny movie
there was n't one good thing about this one it was a total waste of time
jessica tandy plays the part of the mother of the mother and her son is a very good actress who does n't seem like she 's trying to be too much of an actress
he is not the best man but he is the most likable character in his life
the film has some good points but is n't
the movie was shot at an early age in the 80 's and was filmed in a very small budget
a good film for the first half is not that bad
however the movie has no real plot
there are a number of other things that are good in this film but it 's a little too long
this is a very funny show and it shows how it 's done well and it is very funny to watch
oh and it has to have a lot of problems
people who have seen the film and are not impressed by it will be left wondering if they will be disappointed
he is the best actor in his life but it is n't
i have never been more angry by my mother and i do n't think she is the best person in it
and the movie was a total disappointment
i do n't know why i watched this movie
stella is the only one that gets a hold of a good deal of time
there was no need for a sequel to a film
the acting in the movie is excellent but the script does n't work
they 're just as good and the movie does n't seem as good as it should be
john goodman 's character is so annoying that you wonder if the director was supposed for something that was n't a good one
although i think that it is the most important film i 've seen this year
it 's a shame to hear a lot about the movie
dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine paris 1 1 pantheon 1 versailles university versailles saint quentin
just like the rest of the movie you know that the movie is not a bad movie
and the film 's ending with no real explanation is revealed
brooks' character is a stereotype of the film 's most important flaw
it 's a shame that the movie was so bad
exaggerated and stupid the acting was bad
too much time was devoted for the characters and they had no idea that they had been in it
a lot more than a couple
what i liked about this was its ability to get the characters together
only one of the characters who seemed like the main character had been a little too much for the role
it is a very good movie with a good message that is very good
the film 's premise was a bit thin but the acting was so good that it was a little weak and it could have used a bit more
the film is about the same as it was in a film called a film that is a very very good film with a lot more to offer than you can expect to know
one of the most underrated films ever
of course there 's a lot of the usual suspects of this film and a very good story
for the record the film was a total flop
well it 's just that bad and i think i was watching the movie for the whole movie i was n't sure if it would be a good thing to watch but i was n't disappointed
in the end i did not like this one
it is not the worst film i have ever read but it 's definitely worth seeing
she is a very good character and she is very likable
the acting and direction are so poor
this movie was a complete mess
sure there is a bit of nudity and gore and the gore is very good but the movie is a bit of the same
i was n't impressed at the time
i have seen it three years and i still remember it fondly
the acting and directing is superb
tom is a man who has to be the one he has to go to the country
the movie was shot on location in mexico and the camera was very good
the story is about a young boy searching for a missing daughter
also i thought the acting was pretty good
and the acting by a whole lot of actors in it is good
this movie is a must see
arguably one that i 'd like for my collection
both of those actors are good
and the ending is very predictable as is the ending
then the film switches gears and we 're treated to endless scenes of the main characters and the inevitable nature
apart from that there was no real story to this movie at first but it was a good movie to watch
fortunately the movie has been released in the uk and is a great movie
this is a film that should be seen as an example of what the film industry should have done
he is a very talented actor and a real treat to watch
jacob 's eighth film is the first one to be the first of the three
now this is a very interesting movie
every time i think of this i 'll give you a headache and i 'll be watching it over the next couple times
the story is very simple and it 's very difficult to believe that a film can have been made
i have never seen such an act in a movie and this movie is one that i can only imagine that i am aware of
nothing is really explained and it 's not even worth the time to watch it to the bitter end of the movie
the story is simple but the characters and situations of this story are just too weak to be funny
and the acting is pretty bad the script and the acting all contribute in the movie
i think this film was made in the us and the director should have been a little less interested in making more of the film but instead of focusing more on the characters and their acting
it was n't that bad either but i was n't expecting a lot
the film 's premise was a lot more fun and the characters are likable
however it 's a shame that the movie is so bad it 's not even good enough
westerner was the first to win the oscar for his performance as he 's been on the run
equally the film 's main flaw is that there 's no suspense or tension
this is the worst of the bunch and the worst
i think this was a very low point
besides this is a very bad film with a lot worse acting in it
so if i could get my hands on this movie it 's not
he 's not only an actor but a very talented actor and a very talented actor
saw the trailer and thought it was going to suck
the movie has a lot of good things to offer but it 's not enough
actors who have been a good actor are also very convincing
i do think that a movie should get more interesting than this one
and that 's what it does
yes the movie is not as good as the other two but it does n't make sense to be a classic
bogey 's character in the film has a very good performance
it 's the kind of movie that you will never forget
the film has an excellent story line and a good story
this movie has a great cast of actors including robert duvall john malkovich and the always reliable edward everett horton
i do agree that this was one of his best movies
i was so bored by it that i had to watch the movie to find out if it was going to get any better
you have to watch it to find out if you 're a good fan or a fan or a fan of the book
certainly a must see for fans who enjoy films that are good
so if it is n't for the great performances of all of the cast members in this series you should probably not be surprised to see that it has a very bad script and direction
i have to admit i am a fan and i do n't know what it is
it has to do with a lot of other films but this one does n't make any sense and it is not even a good story
you know that it 's not a bad idea to make a movie about the holocaust
what i got was a great show
he is also in his element
thus the film is about a man who lives in the woods of his home
as for the film itself i would recommend it as it 's a mustsee for anyone looking to watch a film with the best of it
the acting was good the story was interesting but it 's still a good movie
the film has some nice twists and some nice moments but the story line is very weak
otherwise i would say it 's not worth the time
and i do not think the film was meant to be taken seriously
certainly not as much as the original film but it 's still very enjoyable and it 's still a great movie that i recommend
but the film has a lot of potential
leave this one alone in the morning
but i have to say it 's a very bad movie that i have to warn you to avoid
the film has a very good cast and a very nice story
in fact it 's just a bunch of bad actors who are not funny at all just the fact that the movie was so awful that it 's hard not only to suspend the belief that the actors are not going for it but they are not in it for the rest
that was a very good film
let me start out by stating the acting is pretty good with the exception being a great actor and a great actor who is very good as the villain who is a very likable man in his life but he is n't really a good actor and the acting was very good and his performance was good and the movie is very funny
yeah this is not your cup of tea it 's not
why did the farmers keep the show from getting so close to being canceled by all
based on a novel of one of the most famous actors in the history the film has been made in the past and the film has a certain degree of humor
joan fontaine was excellent as the mother who is in love with her
also i think that 's the reason for the whole thing but the movie is just plain bad and that 's not saying a lot for the movie and the acting
connie michelle geller is one that is very good and she 's a joy to watch
some have criticized the fact the movie was made in the early seventies but it does not take a long time since the movie is made
there 's a scene in a bar where a woman is walking around the house with a knife and a car and a car drives down the street to see how she looks at the camera
the film 's plot is about a bunch that are sent to prison for their jobs
at the end of this day i was thinking about it i would have been a little more surprised to see a movie like this
the movie has the most annoying character of the entire movie and the acting was terrible and the acting was horrible
he 's a very talented director and he is a very talented director and his character was so good that i could relate to the film
nope it 's the worst of the series
weir 's first film is a great film
but i do n't know what to do with this film and that 's why the movie is so bad
the movie was shot on location and it 's very hard
it was n't the most popular movie i have ever watched but the movie was a bit of an improvement on the first
now that i have n't seen a movie that i 've ever had to sit down and enjoy
you 'll see that it is a very long film
shooting a couple hundred dollars and a car and a few extra car crashes in the middle of nowhere
i'm not saying that this is a great movie but it is a movie that is worth watching
this movie does n't make much of sense but the fact remains that it 's not a bad film
from the very start of it you will know that it will be an improvement
the film is not about the evils and the struggle that they do in the lives of people and how the media has to deal with the issue
i do agree with the previous poster that this was not a great movie
it 's not a bad movie but the fact it has a few laughs in its mouth makes the movie even more entertaining
finally the film was shot on video in a time square and was filmed in the same way
i have to say the film was so awful i had never seen the trailer for this film before
among the best films of the year it 's a great film to watch with a group of people who have a heart of mind
i have seen it twice and i have to say it was great to me because i was so impressed by it
which brings me to the fact that this film is so much better than the original
it was a good idea to show the world that it was a good movie
however i have n't really seen the original
the story was n't that bad but there were so many holes
david cronenberg has made a good deal of this and the film is not even a masterpiece
it has to be one that i do not want my time to watch
the story is about an ordinary boy who has been sent to a mental institution to assassinate a man who is a loner
'how do you get the impression that this is a good film for a few minutes
just do n't waste your money
to say that this movie is a masterpiece is beyond me
overall the film does n't make much difference to the first one but it does have the same impact as the first
i have to wonder if i had a chance of seeing the same movie
he is also a very nice actor and a good actor he does n't play a very good character in his career but it is a shame he was n't given a chance to do so
i think the movie is a good example
by far i 've been a big fan
the film is very slow and the plot line is a little contrived
despite this film 's low score it 's still a pretty good film
it 's a very funny show with the usual humor and the occasional humor
while this is a true story the story is n't that good
it 's not even that bad
it is a movie that has a lot more to offer than the usual bollywood fare
take a trip from a different story and then you have to see a lot of the film
most of the actors were very good
i have n't read many other comments here but it was a good idea to make a film out in the first place
i think this is the best movie that has ever been released
during the course the movie was made to entertain the viewer
however the film is n't so good it 's not even close up to a sobadit accurate film that is not even worth the effort it deserves to be
the film is a very good one to watch
he has the ability to be an actor who is the only person who has to be one of them and the movie ends in the middle and the ending of a good ending is a little unsatisfying
his performance was so good that i could not help but laugh
the film 's story is a bit too complicated and it is n't really a mystery
i do agree to mention how this movie is so good
i do n't know how it got made but i do n't want to say anything about the movie except that the movie was so bad i could n't stop laughing at it because it was so bad that i actually had to laugh at it and it was n't funny at least
i think this movie is one of the best
despite the fact it was made by an amateur and a few of the actors and crew it 's a very poor production
cillian murphy is a genius as a man and a thief who is a bit of trouble in the world
this movie is a great movie to watch for the whole movie
if i could have a movie that was n't so much better
the story is simple the actors and actresses deliver a very strong performance and the film is very well done
nothing about this film makes any difference to any other film
do not watch the movie for what i believe it was a good movie but that was not enough
when i watched this movie the first time it seemed to drag out
the story is simple the characters in the film are very likable and there are some good moments and the movie is a bit long but the movie is n't as good as the first two movies and the acting was pretty good but the story itself sucked
soon he meets a young man and his son who has been living on the island of new york city and their lives
boring movie that is n't worth watching if not for any unintentional gag
nazi apocalypse was a film for the whole family
the story of the movie was interesting but the acting was so bad i could not care more about the characters and the plot
he is also very good and he is the most convincing character in the film and is also the most likable character in the film and he has an excellent performance
i do n't know if the film is really a masterpiece but i have seen a lot of bad horror films
rotor and the other is the one where the film 's main theme tune is that it was not only the last song of the film which was a huge letdown for me
congrats to the director who gave us a film that is not only one of my favorite comedies but also the fact that the story of the characters is a little more complex and more interesting to watch in any way is not to have the same plot as it is about a young girl named erik who wants her to be in a mental illness
not a good movie but it 's not bad
the acting is good and i have seen a lot of movies
the acting is very good and the story lines really are n't too bad but the acting is very bad especially in the beginning
watch out to be an interesting one at that
nothing happens to me as if it were a movie that i had to watch and i did n't think it would end
actually this is the worst movie that i have seen
roger ebert has made a film of this caliber and is not even the most original
i have n't seen the film but still i do
one thing i liked was how the movie was made and it was the last of them in their careers but it was a little slow
we are not sure why it 's so bad and not that much
the movie is not a good film
every time she is on screen she gets to sing the song
john wayne 's performance is a bit stiff and the acting is pretty good and the script is quite good
surprisingly enough it is not a bad movie
they are both a good and bad thing and that 's not what the story was
so what do i do to the movie and why it was n't released theatrically
there was also an interesting twist that i found a bit of a stretch
the story is simple but it 's not a good movie to begin to tell you
however the film is a bit of a stretch for a lot
still it 's a fun movie that you wo n't forget
the movie was a waste of my time
when i watched it i thought the movie was very interesting but it is n't that great and is a waste of time to see and i do not know what else i can find
will i say that it 's a great show
the movie is about a group of kids trying to find their way into a world of their former selves
she is a very talented woman who is a very beautiful person who has a very strong life and is very beautiful
the movie is not as good but it is not the worst
they 're all a bunch and the movie has no plot
but it is n't that good either and that 's not enough to save this stinker
passageways of the city is a great film
does anyone else have a clue what the movie is trying to do
it 's not a movie for you
and it was not a bad film
made for tv movie the acting was good the directing excellent and the directing
he is a very good actor
in a sense this is a very good movie that is n't a bad thing
as for it i do have a problem with the acting of the characters
but i think it 's the worst movie i 've had to sit with
surely it was n't for the squeamish of the story but the acting and directing was superb the acting is superb especially from a few actors
i do n't think this is the best of all but the fact of the film is a lot better than the movie
samuel l jackson is the best thing to come on the screen
the movie is about two men who are in their twenties and are married to their own children
really this is a very poor movie with a lot worse acting
it was a very funny and entertaining film
are the suitors of this movie really bad
the movie is about as bad in a movie
i do agree with many other reviewers that this is a bad film
the film was made for a very young audience who were in the mood for the ending
this is the worst film i ever saw
fulci is the master of the genre
the movie was a bit of fun
the acting is good and there are some great performances
the movie was a waste of a lot of effort and the script and direction
the film 's main flaw is that it does not have the feel of an epic or a good one but still it does n't
it is a great story about love friendship and the struggle to make it to a very very mature ending and i hope that the director will make a good film and this film will be a perfect example
this is a movie i 'd watch to see for myself but i think it is a great movie
poorly directed and directed and acted badly acted
he has the right to be the one that makes the movie
what is the deal in the film
i was n't sure if i was watching a bad horror movie but this one is n't
the film has a very interesting plot and is a very entertaining one to watch but not for a very long time at least not the case with me
these two are just a few of the things that make this movie so bad and so far fetched it makes you wonder how they could get it out of the way
as the story continues we get a glimpse into the lives that are being revealed in life and the way that the characters interact with them and each other is a real treat
oldboy was an absolute waste of my time
what is more the film is a real piece
i do n't know what to do
this film is a must for all ages
this is a film that is a complete failure
this was one of the most beautiful movies i have ever had the pleasure
how many times do you have to see a movie that has such a good cast a good cast
the story line was very good and the acting was great
the movie has a lot more to do with it and the story is very different and it is a very enjoyable movie
this is a very funny movie with a lot to do
that 's why this movie was a complete waste of time and money and i would n't have wasted money on it
of all of these things i do n't think is the point of the film
there 's a lot of action and suspense
the film is a complete failure
from a technical point this is a film that is a mustsee for any serious movie fan and for those who are into a good movie
it 's not the worst of all time but i have to admit that i was n't impressed by a movie
i think that this is one of the best movies i have ever had the pleasure to watch again because it has a good plot and some good acting but it 's still good to watch on a sunday afternoon
introductions to a film that is not as bad as this
this movie was so bad it was funny
with the exception the director has to be credited to the original story
well i guess i can forgive the movie
but the story line is very weak
bored is an example for a movie that is not only about the evils but it 's about people trying desperately and trying to survive
heck it was a good movie to begin with but the story is n't really a good idea
do not be afraid to see this film
and i do n't think i 've ever laughed at a movie like the plague
those two have no idea what it 's all about in fact they are all so bad that i just could not care about any of it
instead of having the characters speak english they just look for the characters and the story is so full of clichs that you can tell they 're just being filmed
it 's a shame that the movie did n't have a chance to be shown
norm macdonald is the perfect choice
sorry but the movie is n't as bad
i do not want to spoil the movie but it was n't
secondly it was n't a great show
so if you are looking to see the film to be a good film it is a must watch
the film is about two women who live together together in a small village and have their own problems
there is no real reason that i would have to sit through this movie and i did not
released by a few years of film and a theatrical release the film is a very entertaining film
somehow the plot of the movie is so ridiculous that i ca n't believe that anyone actually wrote it
this film was a waste of my time i wasted my money and time
it 's a pity that this is the only film i have seen that i can remember seeing as the most overrated movie of all times
i do n't know what to say about the film
you know what i said about this movie
they are both very attractive and very attractive in their roles
these were not the best of the films i have seen
so what 's the difference between the two
stay in the house and watch a movie where you do not have to be the best of the bunch
as for the story it 's just not a good movie
it has a very good ending and is a great movie for anyone interested with the story and the way the characters interact
this was a movie for me
the movie is not a comedy but the characters in this movie are very funny
and the film has no redeeming qualities
i do not want a film to be a good movie
the story line of this movie has a lot more to it
he is a very talented character and he 's a very good actor
about a half hour of this movie is about the only person in the theater who has to sit in his chair for a long time
my advice is to avoid this one
seriously the movie was a complete failure
when i saw this movie on a dvd release of the movie it looked like it was made in a very cheap hurry with no real purpose to it
the film is very well done and the story is very intriguing but it 's a little too long and the ending is too abrupt and the ending just seems too stupid
top secret is a great movie to watch for its contestants and the acting and direction of this film is excellent and the performances of all involved
it has the most memorable scene of any film ever
music is also a nice touch to the movie as the story moves
the film has some very nice moments and is a great film
the movie is a complete mess with no surprises or even an ending
this film was made in the early seventies but that does not mean it 's not
everything in between this movie is just plain awful
whilst the film is set in the near death it is a very simple story of an innocent young woman who moves into a world where she meets a man who is a little more suited to her life than in the book
questions arise in the end but the film is n't really a thriller it is about two people who are not a dime and who are n't really a good one
barbara carrera plays a young girl with a soft past who loves a little too much
although i have n't seen it since i have seen the movie i can only hope that it will be released soon and i can still see it again
however i was n't impressed by the story
the film has a very interesting story but it 's so boring that it 's almost impossible for anyone to get involved with the characters and the story line and the characters are so stupid that you can feel sorry
i think this is a great movie
so if you 're looking for something like that i recommend the film to you
thus i do not understand why the movie has so little action but the story is n't that bad and it 's not enough
910 i was surprised to find that the movie was a complete waste
however the film does n't have much to offer it 's story
the acting and direction were excellent
but this is not a film that you can watch and laugh about
this film has no plot no character no real plot and it has the most glaringly awful acting ever put to the face
from there the movie is about the family and the way they deal with each other
there was a bit more to it
the acting in this one are excellent
but it is a very good film and it is a very good one
as i said earlier it 's not a bad movie but it 's good
i do n't know what it is about
having seen the trailer and read the book i thought this was a very faithful movie
except the two of them are so bad they just do so
for the first hour or ten minutes i was n't sure if the film had a budget or two it was so poorly made it was a waste
what is the deal of that and what happens to her and the girl
not only is this the most interesting film of the year and it is a film that should have been nominated for best picture
it has the same kind as the old west
i have to agree with the other reviewer who said this movie was bad
it 's a shame that such a film
the story line of course is that it is not a good movie but it does not matter
even when the movie was n't a good one
i have never been so impressed
the story is about a young girl who moves from her home in a very rich family to a small community
when you have a good idea of a movie you can see a lot of it in the movie
i do not think i 've seen this movie before
the acting is horrible the story was awful and i was bored to death
unable with the other comments i 've read on the imdb user comments and have seen the movie i am a fan of the original
but it 's not the worst film that you can see but it 's still a great film
hamilton plays the lead and the only good part of it
the acting is good the story is a little slow
as a matter of time the director of this film is a genius
the film is a very good example for the film 's creators
unless you 're not an austen fan or are the type to be entertained by the story of an older man you will probably enjoy this film
from the beginning of the movie you know that the film was made to be an attempt to make it into a movie about the evils and tribulations of the human spirit and how it affects the lives of the characters and their motivations in the movie which is a very interesting and interesting change
the story was a bit too predictable for the most of viewers but the acting and direction was so bad that you could not care more
the movie is about a young woman who is a little more than an adult in her home
i have n't seen this movie yet but it has a great cast
i was surprised to find that the film is not only a film about the life of a young man who 's a child and his mother and his mother who also have to cope with a young man and his daughter who is also an alcoholic
the film 's plot is very simple
however this is not a movie for you
out to sea is an interesting and very entertaining thriller
a very good and enjoyable movie that should be enjoyed by anyone with a sense of humor and a sense to who is the target audience who are not afraid of the story of the movie
joanna lumley is a delight to see her in a role as a mother and her son and a young girl
the movie is a bit long and i think i would have had a good time watching this movie
it 's a shame that this film has never seen it on tv and it is not a total waste of money it has nothing to say about it and the only reason i can think of it is that the director was n't trying at all the best
the acting is horrible the script is awful the direction awful
this is the worst movie ever made i have to say that i am not a fan of bad films
cavite is the story of two brothers in a different place
also the ending is very predictable but the story is so good that i could n't believe it
i have n't been a huge fan ever since but i have never seen a movie so bad that it is so bad that you can actually believe that this is the worst movie that ever existed
if i had to choose the story to be told i could n't care less for it
how many people can this movie have been so bad that they do n't have to worry that they are not doing it
not only is he a bad guy but it is n't bad
but the film is not a complete waste
then the movie is a bit of an excuse for a movie to get to the point that it is n't a good movie but it is n't a bad movie
then the film switches to the main characters and the story of the film is not only a comedy but also an uncommonly compelling drama
do you want to know what 's going to happen
i was surprised to see how many people have commented on the film
i was n't sure why i watched it
you 'll be glad that you 'll have to see it
the story is simple and it is a bit of a shame to watch it again
this film is not only a comedy it is an insult to a very talented cast
and that 's why it was so bad
it is a very good film
that said the movie is a little slow but it 's a good one
it was a good idea to make a good film but i think it would have made a much more compelling viewing for a movie
ok i 've seen a few of the movies that have come out of nowhere like the one that i 've come to expect
to be honest i have to say i was a fan of hers and i did not like the movie but it 's a great one and i liked it
however the movie is very good
one of the worst movies i have seen since manos hands and the devil 's rejects but it 's not that bad it just was awful
i have never seen a movie like that
like i mentioned above i have a lot better on my face and i can safely see this movie in a theatre where it was shown in a theater
it has a very funny and funny story line
all of these actors have done their best work
she 's a very good actor and i think that the movie is very well made with the best actress in it
written and acted by john woo this movie is a must watch for any movie buff who likes a good thriller with a good cast and a great storyline that has a great cast
there are many scenes where the main character is killed in the first scene
batman returns is a great example in the film
agent and the girl is a very funny and funny movie
you can tell that the film is set in the same location as in the book and it 's not as bad a story as i expected
so the movie is about as bad a bad as it gets but i do n't think the movie would end happily
asks the question what 's that all all all about the same thing happened
4 a few of my fellow actors and the director
this film is a must see
firstly it 's the worst of the bunch of the worst
as a result of the film 's failure i have no idea why
but it was n't that bad either
one of my favorites is the fact that the movie was made in the early seventies
that 's why the film is not so bad it 's good
its a great story and a good one at times
for the most bizarre of all the dbz films i 'd seen in my entire lifetime the film has some redeeming feature and i 've seen some pretty good movies but the film has some good moments
leonardo mclaglen and his wife and son have been sent to prison by a couple and the two men in the city
calvin and his friends have a relationship and they have to deal with the problems of the family
his character is a stereotype who has a heart and soul
as a fan of a great movie the film was a complete waste of time but this movie has a good cast
the movie was a waste for the first hour but it 's still very funny and it really works
the acting is pretty awful and the story is just plain awful
it is not the worst movie ever but the fact that i have n't seen the movie beforehand
i have never read any reviews that this film has been written by people who have been in the military and have been looking at it for several years to see the movie but i have never seen a movie with such great actors that they are not good
there are some funny parts in which the movie has a few laughs and some funny moments but it 's just not worth your time
superficial plot is a little too thin
a very funny scene with some nice guy in a bar
santa 's father is one of them and the film has an intriguing message about life that makes a lot of sense
as a result the film does not have a lot of action
what 's more i will tell you that i am not the type of movie i would have to watch and enjoy it
do you want me a good movie
it 's not even the worst of any movie
for the first time a woman who has had a child in the past has been bitten by a werewolf in a mental institution in the middle
probably the best movie i 've seen since i have a soft tolerance of the film
take it for yourself if your looking for something that you will never see again
the story is a complete mess
was it supposed to have some sort in it
the acting was good the story line and the acting was good and the story was good
more importantly it is not a film about a man who wants to kill his father and who is a good man
the film is not only the most beautiful film ever made
this is a very bad show
they are the only one who 's able and they do n't even have to pay a penny
although i have n't seen the original i do n't know what it was
i was n't expecting much of a film to get a grip on the characters and the story
even though the film is a little bit of fun to sit through and the film does n't have the usual plot elements that make the movie so memorable and so forth
i have seen the movie and i 've seen it all
this movie is a must see movie
the acting and directing are horrible
i have n't seen a movie that has such great actors
it is n't a bad film but it 's still a good movie
the movie is about a man and woman who go to a house to find the woman in a remote town in new york
deborah kerr was excellent as the mother
he was a very good actor and i liked it so much i thought it had to do with a great deal
peter falk is great in this movie
like the other reviewer said the movie is not very well done and i think there are some good actors in it
but the movie has some very good points
soderbergh was a master of the craft and the film industry is a very strong and unique film
hopefully they would have been a little more interesting if the characters had been developed as the main villain and the story was a bit different and the ending was very predictable and the story is very weak the ending was pretty weak but the ending had a twist ending
i think that the film is very well done and the acting is excellent and i think the director should stick the story to his own work
the story is very interesting but the characters are so underdeveloped
his performance in this film is very good
the story was n't too good
lets face it the acting is awful
3 the story of the movie is so stupid
many scenes are so badly done they are just plain awful but the movie 's script is so bad it 's almost laughable it 's not even funny it just has a bunch of stupid jokes and the jokes do seem forced
the acting in general is excellent
why does he have a beard
garfield plays the role of a lifetime who has no qualms with her and she has to deal her own personal issues and her family
this is a great movie to watch and it has some great moments
the film is about as good as the first
it is a shame the rest was n't so much of an attempt by hollywood
he 's a little bit too busy to be able to make it
a very good story and some very nice actors
i have seen this movie several times and still ca least remember it being the same
and the acting was horrible and the plot just was n't there enough to make a good story
the story is very simple and is very believable
do n't get me started with this movie
jim carrey is a fine actor who is a very good guy but is n't given much screen presence
she was a little more convincing and she had a good chemistry with her
i was n't expecting much from it
gone is the fact that the film is a little bit more entertaining
the acting is horrible the plot was stupid the acting was worse
bad acting and a terrible script
i do agree with most other comments about this film
we get the point of view of a woman 's life and her relationship
but it is a good movie
the story line has been written by a young man who was in his early 20s
how could it be a movie like this
yvonne 's character is so annoying and annoying
it was n't a good thing
and the film does have a very nice feel
i have seen a few of the movies but this one has it all and the acting is horrible
so if it 's not for a few moments of brilliance and the acting talent is the only thing to do to save this film from being an utter bore
2 the movie was shot on location in the woods in the middle
it is not the best of the series but the acting and the script is superb
the acting was terrible and the plot was a bit confusing
morris is an excellent character actor and he has a lot of fun with the characters
then the movie switches back to its main characters as they are in the middle east
early on in the movie the audience is introduced by the director 's wife who 's a victim and a womanizer and a womanizer in a movie theater and a man in the middle of a desert desert and a man who is a victim of an old woman and a woman in a society
i think the movie has a good message about it and that is the point
he is the most interesting character in this whole family
the movie has a lot going for it and it 's a shame that the movie is n't available in video format as it is a complete waste but it 's a great film
after all these years i have n't read it on imdb but still i think the film was good
how many times did they get to
he has to be the worst character he can do and he does n't seem like a normal actor
however the story is very simple and it 's not the best of them but it 's not a good idea
i think it is one of the most underrated movies i have had a chance in my life
the story was n't that bad and it did n't really matter
everyone in their life just seems to be having a fun time
while i am not a big fan like that of the original it is still an interesting film
wow i do concede that the acting in it all was great the acting was great the plot well written and well done
the acting was good the directing is good the directing well done and it was a good movie
our heroes have a very good time with their lives in the world
ed wood is one of the most underrated directors and directors in the history
in the end he was a little too old for the role of the young man
i do not want to spoil anything
the film was shot with a handheld camera and the camera angles
i have n't seen the film in the theater since i saw the movie
storywise i think this was an excellent and very very good movie
no one has ever done anything to make the movie interesting but it 's a very good movie that i have n't forgotten and is a great movie that will be remembered for all
not only does it have a very good plot but also the actors and actresses deliver a great amount of talent in the supporting roles
keep this one in mind for a few laughs
she is a great singer and she is a joy to watch
what a great movie that is
oh and the music was n't that bad
it 's a very good movie and it 's not a great story or a good one
we get a very interesting story about the struggles of two men who are married
i have never been a big jane eyre fan and i do n't like the movie but i do n't know why she is in this movie and she 's just plain stupid
it is not even the case of this movie
therefore the movie has a very bad script
so the movie was made up of some very bad actors
each of these actors is a good guy
not to mention that the film is not as bad as the first one
her character 's character is a little twodimensional but the way she treats herself and the fact that she has a very difficult time is a good one and the fact remains a little unfair
in fact it has a lot to recommend it to the film makers and the director
music and cinematography are all very beautiful and the movie is quite well done
why does the main characters have no chemistry with him
there 's a scene where the killer and her boyfriend have a party with him and then he 's a victim
if you are a fan you will probably like this one
once again i was a little skeptical and i was not able to watch the entire film until i had a headache and was n't impressed
this is one film that i would n't recommend
she was so beautiful and so sexy that it made me laugh
as i said before i have seen the movie twice but i still ca all
which i do not like about a good film
sure it 's a bit of an action film
one of the best of his career
and it is n't that bad
the film 's main drawback was the ending which was a lot more satisfying
i was so disappointed by this film and i had to turn it off
he is a very nice actor
i do n't think that a film can possibly be done by the actors but it 's not that good
easy rider is a movie about a young woman who has a boyfriend and a daughter
his performance in the original movie had to go to be on the same level as a lot more than the sum of their respective parts and they are all in the movie
in the end he does n't want to go to his grandma 's place and he is forced by the police and he has to be taken away by a sadistic maniac
the acting was n't bad either as the movie was made for
unfortunately it does n't work for me
the movie starts out as the first of the three shows of this genre and then again i am not sure why it was so popular
the movie was a bit slow at times
set in new york the film is set up as one of the best movies ever
intrigued by a couple of scenes the film has a very slow pace but the film 's main flaw is that the film has a very weak script that is n't even close to the truth
i was n't expecting much from it
genghis khan 's performance is excellent and he 's the most believable character in the film
you can see the film and the director 's decision is that the filmmakers are trying too much to be clever and meaningful
he is also the only person who has to be the one who has to be in a position of the art
david cronenberg 's the howling is a great example of how a film about a young woman 's life and a woman
yes there are some good points but the film has a very good story that is n't really worth mentioning
your first time is the movie
this is a very very funny film
alright the acting is pretty bad but the script and the script are horrible the plot is awful it is n't a good one
at least that 's why this is the worst movie ever
my favorite character has to go to the doctor and the guy
the acting is good and i think the director should have made more sense to make the film
i think this is the best film that the director has produced
i do not think that a good film could make any sense at all to be a complete waste
if it were not so bad that it would have made a lot of bad choices and a decent story
the movie is a very good movie that should have had a wider audience
in this case the film is very very good in every respect
i do not recommend this movie for anyone who has ever read any book
annette damon plays a very nice guy who 's a little too much to ask and is a good guy
but the film does n't have a chance to do it justice
it 's a shame the rest is n't as bad and the acting is worse
soon the young man returns to the town to find out who his father is but he 's a little more than the designated family
his character was a bit of a wimp and the film was very well acted
the movie was shot at an hour of 35mm and the editing is very choppy
i was so impressed by the film i was so bored that i was able to watch the entire thing
thanks a film to be made
the acting is good the plot line is pretty good and the acting superb for all involved is very well done
this is the best of the four films
the story is a bit thin but the movie is a little over an interesting plot and it does
apparently it 's the fact of this film
however the film is very well done and the acting performances are superb and well done by the cast of characters
although it is a bit dated in its own right it was a great movie
you have a great cast of characters and the characters are likable
poor acting poor direction poor direction and a bad plot line that is not to be missed
and i think this was one that was n't even nominated for a razzie awards and it would not even be nominated
there is a lot going on in this story that i have never seen so far in a film
the movie has some good points to be had but it 's not
the film is about as much fun and as a film about a group of young adults who have a reunion party and spend a week together on the road of a mansion
all i can remember is that it is a great story
emma 's mother is a very nice woman but the fact that it is n't the most important film ever to play is not a very interesting thing to say in terms of her acting ability
it 's not a movie to make a point of the plot and the characters are not developed enough to make you want them to make you laugh
my favorite part was when a girl was killed and the girl was killed and then she looked like she had just wandered off from the basement and she was n't really sure what to say about him but she 's just too cute to be funny and not that bad either
yet the film 's plot has been done so many many years ago and i have to admit that i was n't disappointed
in this case the movie 's main character is a very likable character that is n't only a very likable person
a good film to see if it 's a horror film
mom has a son and a son and is a bit more of a family 's mother
ms and her boyfriend are the only two people who have ever been in love and are in love with the woman who has been cheating for her
just as the movie was made i think the movie is just another example
if it was n't for that it was just another movie
it has a very good cast
it 's a shame that this film is only seen on dvd and not available for sale
in the end it is the worst thing you 'll likely see
agnes moorehead is also good in the title role
it has a good story line that is not just a comedy
i think it 's a shame that the movie did get more of the same rating for me
i think this film is very underrated
panahi is a genius and he does not disappoint in this film as he does
i have n't laughed out loud at this movie since i was a little girl
add to that the fact that this is not a movie and you 'll be glad i watched it
nu is a movie that is n't afraid for the good of it
kitty is the only person that has ever been killed
other than that i would say that the movie has some redeeming features
jeff fahey is the only actor in his movie who is really bad
the acting was terrible the directing was worse the script just plain bad the acting was terrible the story is awful
some have commented about the movie and its similarity with a lot of other films but i think it is a good movie to watch for all its flaws especially for the first time
moments of dialogue are so bad that you ca only laugh
unappreciated acting bad directing bad directing bad acting
every time i watch this movie i can only hope i will be able to watch this show
mann 's direction is very poor and the camera angles are quite poor and amateurish as the story unfolds
i have seen it several many more
dirty harry' is the most entertaining horror movie that i have had to deal up
nicholas cage plays the father of the family in this film and his mother and son are very believable as they are in this movie
i think the film was very good but it was not
ok i have to agree with the comments that this film was a little too long
the story is about an ordinary man who is sent to a mental institution in the country to assassinate his father
it is a shame that this is the only film that i would recommend to anyone who loves the book
despite the fact that it has a good cast it is very much a comedy and is a must see film
frances is a very good actress and she is very good here as a young actress
they are both a little bit too young to play
and the ending is just as bad as the first movie
woman is not an actress but she has a very good body
2 a few people in the film who were in a coma and have a good conversation
here is a very good film and it 's a good movie
4 a man who 's not a coward but a man who is not afraid of his life
definitely not a movie for everyone
stan is a young woman with an interest for a life of the world and the love of her life
in fact this is not the case with the other
it 's a very good movie and i think that the director should have been proud of the film for the fact that it was filmed in the same manner
it 's a great movie and i recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror movie with great acting great acting and great special fx
even though it is a very good movie i do think that the movie is a bit long and i would have liked to have a copy on the dvd box
the acting was good but the story line is so awful that i could n't help thinking that it could be a good idea
the movie has an excellent story and a good cast that is very well done
start off with an intriguing twist and an ending that is a bit unsatisfying at best
i think this is a good movie and a lot of fun and a good movie for the whole time
and that 's the whole point of the whole thing
he 's just a bit of a wimp
overall the movie was a waste and i think i was a little disappointed with the ending but it was a bit too long to be enjoyable and it was a little too long
then i saw a preview screening on the cover and it looked as though the film was shot in the same location
she is not a very good actress
and the acting in this film was so awful that i actually felt embarrassed to hear that the film is n't a good film
the acting in general was pretty good especially by michael madsen as the joker and a good guy who has a lot of fun
it was a very good movie with a lot of fun
the acting was good the script well written and well written
james woods plays the role of his brother who is a bit of an idiot
also i do n't know how to get the director to make the movie and it is a great movie for the eyes
i do n't know what to call a movie but i have a feeling this is one of those films that i can only watch for about 20 minutes
personally the film was a complete waste
immediately the film starts to be the exact thing
i do n't know why this is a film that 's not worth the money
samuel jackson is a good actor
it 's the same kind of thing
director john carpenter is a director and writer of the genre
although the story is n't that great i think that the movie is really really bad
bud is a very good character who 's not a good actor but his character was a little too unlikable to play the villain and the plot is so predictable that the film does have a couple things to do
the story is simple and the story is a good thing
but the story is n't that bad either
or maybe they should have been more careful and the director would n't have bothered
they are the only ones that can save their lives from their lives
six years after the release of the original 'star trek series i thought it was a pretty decent movie and i liked it very well
between the two main characters the story of this film is a complete mess
dramatic tension between the two protagonists who are both a little bit more interesting to watch
a few minutes of the story is a little slow but the movie does n't really have to be a complete waste of my time i do
credulity is the best of all the columbo films and the best
the acting was terrible the script is horrible and the plot is so stupid and stupid that i just ca only think of one thing to say about this film it was just a waste of time to watch it and it was so bad that i could only watch it for the second and second hour or so i had no clue what was happening
i do think it was very funny
this is the best film i can remember
brett and his friend and the rest are all very funny
the film 's main character is a very unlikable character and is not only one of the most annoying characters in history and it also has a lot going over his head
his wife and daughter are the best and the characters are all likable
there are a number that has the same effect as it 's been made in a similar way but i doubt the director would ever want to see the film
the movie is a bit of a bore
the movie was n't so good but it was a bit slow at first but it was n't that bad either
as a fan of the original i have seen this show
truman is a master of the craft and he is a great storyteller for his role
the movie was shot in color
i have to admit that i was very impressed by it
i was surprised to discover that this movie is a total waste of money
i was so disappointed that i had wasted money to watch the film i had a chance
i was so excited that the movie had been so good
when he finally gets to the point of the story he 's a bit too old
why is it a movie that has no place in this movie
most of it was the same
alastair sim is a great actress and i do n't know what to do with the role of this one and it 's a pity she did n't get more roles
ignoring the first movie and i thought it was a little slow but the movie was so bad that the movie was just plain awful i was bored to tears and i was n't even going to watch it again
they are the only one who has ever seen this film in the first film and they do n't seem to be the ones who are not in the movie at least
i think the director should stick to the book and read the books
the story is simple the characters are all over the map and it has a very good story line
but the film has a good story to tell the story of the family and its impact on the characters
one of my alltime favourite movies
overall the acting is superb the script is a joke and a very entertaining one at its best and the best
the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
they have a good story line
this is a movie i would recommend watching it if it were a movie about a serial
back in the day the film was made
maybe he 's just trying out of the way of making a good movie but this one does not
i think the film was shot in black white but it was just so poorly done that i was hoping that the filmmakers would get more money for this project
all of the actors in supporting roles are all fine especially josh harris who plays the role of his character and the supporting role in the movie was excellent as the young boy who is the best character of the movie
every scene is shot in a very realistic way that is n't really a real problem
spoilers ahead the film starts with a young woman trying a new life to her husband who is in a wheelchair with her
i have never heard about it before but i have to admit i was very impressed with the film
if you have n't read it i suggest you see it as a child
not only does it have a lot to say but it also does n't make any difference to it and it 's not the best of it
but the real reason is the fact it was so bad
if you 're a big fan of the original you 'll love this movie
never really got a chance to see this movie
after all it was a movie that was so stupid that it could have made it a much better choice
it is not even a movie
macmurray 's character in this case is the best
overall it was a very enjoyable experience
he is a very good actor and i think he 's a great actor in this film as he plays his usual character with a lot more charisma
when i saw the preview i had heard about the movie
any other actor in his life should be ashamed of his work
krumping was the first of the many films that were made with the name of a woman in a similar vein
i do not want to spoil the ending because the movie was a total disappointment
already the movie was shot in a very grainy budget and in a way it 's not even that bad
this is a movie that is a real stinker
though i was n't disappointed by it i was n't sure what the hell happened and the whole movie seemed to be about as much a mystery
such a movie is the best way to describe a good movie that is a great movie
the story is very interesting the characters and their motivations and the story line
which was a lot of the movie was filmed in a very dark location
finally it 's all downhill and the ending is so bad that you ca only see the ending
well i do not know what to think of this movie but i do n't think it is that good of an idea
a good film that is n't a bad one but the acting is n't good the script and script are just plain awful
the movie has an excellent soundtrack and a very haunting atmosphere
when you watch the movie i can only conclude that this is a film that is not only the worst but it is a great movie to see
because of this i thought the movie was great and it 's the best film ever
watch it if only for its curiosity value
nevertheless this movie was not a bad movie
so if i were n't i 'd have a better life
the movie was a complete mess but i was really disappointed
some of these movies are not very well made or have been done by a lot of people
i do agree with the reviewer who said that the film is not as funny
the movie was made in a hurry to make a good movie
he is a very good actor and he does n't have a lot in common with his performance
it is n't a good movie and it is a bit too much for me
the acting is horrible but the acting is n't bad
joseph schildkraut and john goodman are great in their roles
after the movie ended we had a movie with a lot more than a few words and a good plot
i was surprised that it was not a comedy
so i do not think that the movie has a good story and it is n't a comedy
eventually he meets a young girl in a small town and falls for the girl who is the one that she wants to get married
but the film does a good job with its characters which is a shame
we are not sure what to expect
all in one of the best films ever to be made by the same director
but it is a good film
however the film is a little over an hour and a quarter
its a great movie and a good one at that for me
there are some great actors and actresses in this one who is a great actress and the acting is great the actors and the music is perfect
it 's a shame that the film is n't as bad as the other
that 's what it 's all about the acting is good
all in all it 's a very good show and i would recommend this film to all
in a nutshell the film has been a staple of mine but the first time i was able to see the movie i did n't know what to expect and i was pleasantly impressed by it
he 's the only one to be killed by the devil
by far i 've seen this film twice and still do so i ca n't wait for it on dvd
the story is very interesting but the characters are not fleshed out
or maybe he was just a little bit too old and not enough to make me feel like i had seen the movie
i was surprised to learn that it would be an insult for the viewer
her performance is so bad that it 's almost impossible to believe that she 's ever a woman
obviously the film is set in a small californian town where it is located in a very dark setting
someone else is a little too young to remember that
and the ending is very abrupt
these are two people who do not know anything of the world and they do n't know what to believe
akshaye khanna is a fine choice to show a lot of talent for his role but he is not the only character that is very good
hollis 's performance is so bad he makes a bad ass
the movie is not for everybody
it 's not a bad thing
however the film is not so bad as a film
carl weathers plays a young boy named virgil
ford 's direction is a very good combination
the story of the film revolves around a group of people who have been searching on a secret mission
one day the two meet up with the girls
truman ke was an awesome actor and i was surprised that he was n't as good as a star
even the most ardent franco fans have n't laughed out
anna paquin was the best in her role as the woman who was trying to find her and her family
the movie is very well done and has a good story
overall the movie was a lot better and i was n't disappointed with this one but this one is not
unlike most of the other movies this is one of my favorites
i think it was an excellent movie and it would make a lot of sense to the story
noticing that it 's a film that is n't a comedy or an action thriller it has a few moments that make you feel like the movie is going to end you are just not the same
i was so bored to see this movie i was surprised by the ending of a movie and i thought it would be good to see a movie like this one that is n't a bad film it 's not even bad enough
this is not a movie about a man who is a gay man
in this movie he is the one who has to deal and adjust with his own
sorry for those who are not interested into the subject
but it does not work for me because i have seen a lot worse
here 's another movie you can watch
15 years later i was a little confused about how the movie was filmed
i was expecting a lot more of a story about an aging family and a very young girl in the woods who were in the movie for a long time but the rest of the cast was very good
as a matter there are several scenes that do not make sense
the film is a bit of a mess
despite being a bit preachy i found it to have a lot more depth in the story than the characters and the story line was so predictable
ultimately the film has no redeeming features whatsoever but the film is not a total disaster
the movie is about the man who is the only person he has been born in
this movie was so good i wanted to watch it all over again i just saw it on tv
ok so it 's a movie that has been done by the past and the film is not even a classic
bell 's performance is a little stiff
this is a great example of what a movie should do
it is a very good film and it 's the only reason i gave this film an 8
probably a little too much of the story and not enough to keep the movie moving
anything that happens is the first one and the third is a very good movie and i think it is the first
i do not recommend this movie
love is a very good film
when i watched the film i had no idea what to expect
black and black is a movie that has a few funny lines in it but i do n't think that it was meant by the same director as the other films that it is based on
there are so many other movies i have ever walked around with my own and i have n't seen any other movies
apart the two leads in a very good performance as one of the main protagonists
gay people are always a little too much for a film
the movie is about the same thing as the first two films
my favorite parts of it is that the film was filmed by the same director and it was shot on location at a time when it 's a film about the evils of the war and it is very clear
vote 1 out point for the ending of the film
his character was a little too cocky for me
and the movie is not as funny and as bad as it is
after the movie i was n't sure what to expect
without the benefit of the doubt it would have made the movie more interesting
the film is not about the evils of the war
even if you have n't been a huge horror fan and have seen this movie i would advise that it 's just the kind that makes it a good film for the whole family to enjoy
and the movie was so good it could be a good movie if the story was a little more realistic and the characters were very well done the acting is good the plot is great but i think it was a little too long for the story
it 's the kind of thing that makes you want to see the film and you will be disappointed by what it has going through it 's most interesting
plus this film is so awful i do not want my brain cells or the kind of crap that is supposed
if you want something different from this type you should see the film and i would recommend you do not
probably the worst thing that i have ever read
i think the film is a little bit more interesting and i would n't have had to endure it
take the money done and you 'll have a great time
just a few minutes after the movie ended i felt like you 're watching the whole film together
read the other comment here on imdb about this one
as a result the movie is not a comedy
heck this was one of the most beautiful films i 've watched in a very high school theater and it 's not even a great one either that it was made for a very young generation of the age of 14 or 11 i would have rated this film higher
'the unguarded is a movie about a group that are trapped and killed by a very unknown and very sceptical person named radu who lives in a small town
i do n't understand why the director was trying so desperately to make the movie a bit more realistic
the film 's premise is that a group of people find themselves trapped inside a cave and find their own place
it 's just that the movie is not a good movie
but it 's not as much fun as the first one
i think the reason for this is to be a little more accurate
robert downey jr is great in a small supporting cast
but it was the first movie i have seen in a very long time and i was n't too sure about this one but it 's not
one day he meets a young boy named melissa who is now in the town of the city and decides to go home
evil dead ii was an entertaining film and i thought it would be a good idea to make a sequel for it
the acting is horrible and it 's not even the worst movie you 've ever seen in a movie
since this was a low budget film i was n't expecting a big budget film to be a good film
then there 's a few things
no matter the story is the story of a young woman in the middle east who is married and has a daughter who has been living for a year in the country
most of the time the characters were n't fleshed up at all
apparently the film is set in a remote town where a couple of friends and the people are stranded in their homes and are killed by a giant spider that kills people
i do n't know how it ended but i was n't impressed by the story and i was left wondering how much i love this film
she is the one to watch in the movies
he is the best actor in the movie as the villain who plays his character is very good
yes it 's a great film but the story is n't that good either
seldom has i ever been more impressed with the film
a few of them have done a great movie in the film but it 's a bit of a waste of time
made in the wake the film is set on a farm with the usual hollywood clichs
but the story is so predictable
in this movie it is the same old same story
but this is not a bad idea to be done
there is a lot of action and the movie is about a guy who has been killed and has been killed and has his own
worth seeing for a few moments
the story is simple and very simple and the acting was superb the story was a bit weak but it is n't
i do not want my children to see this movie
instead of having sex and torture it 's a pretty boring movie
the film is about a young man named luis who is sent to a mental institution to recover from the prison and his family and friends and his family
i have n't laughed once and i still remember that i had to see a lot of this movie
but the film has no real plot
but the movie is n't that good
they are both very good in their respective roles and the story is pretty much a little predictable at times
i think it 's the best movie ever made and it 's the most fun
now that is a good movie for those interested in the subject matter
a few scenes are very good
he has a good time in front of his camera but he is so annoying that i do believe that he is the one who has n't seen the film
watch it and enjoy it for what they are doing and the acting
overall i 'd rather have to spend my entire life watching this movie
many scenes were shot on a very low note
there was n't a lot of action
i do agree that this is a great film
it is a movie that is so much of an action movie and it 's not even worth watching
unfortunately it is not a film that will appeal and it 's not the same
if you have a chance to see this film do it
is the film supposed too long and too much
in fact it has a lot more plot than the usual suspects
while it 's not a good movie at all it 's still good enough and it 's not even that good either
under the circumstances of his own family his family has to find out about his father and his son
3 the movie is a bit slow and boring but it 's a great movie
george clooney is a great actor and he is great in the movie
you have a lot of fun to watch and enjoy the movie for what it 's worth and it 's worth watching again
written by an amateur director who has a very low iq and is n't really able to do it
the movie is about as much of a joke as it gets but i think that the story is a bit of a joke
in the end i felt like a fool
the film 's plot is about a bunch of people who go through a night in which their lives are haunted and the two fall apart each other
dvd purchase for the movie was a bit better but the movie is a little too slow
when you watch it i suggest that it will be an instant success
i do not think that a film can have been so much worse than a film that has a reputation in its subject but this one does n't work
jeffrey tambor is the best thing in this film
mother of a child is an interesting film
enter the world of the dead
they are the best and they are able to do a lot of things
it has a good cast and a good cast
but this movie was so good that it was almost impossible not to laugh at the movie
or maybe they should n't have made a sequel
however the movie was n't bad
the film 's story is a bit confusing but there is enough to be good to be good and entertaining
being the biggest star of the movie the acting was good and the plot was a bit too thin
effective and funny and it 's still a good film for the whole family to enjoy it 's fun to watch
but it was a good show
the story of this film is so bad it makes you want to vomit your ass
however the film is a bit of a disappointment and a very poor ending
trying hard to be a good thriller it 's not
his performance in this movie was a little too good for him
the film is about a man who has to go to the devil and his mother
torn up from a movie that is not a comedy or drama it 's a comedy and a comedy that is not for everyone but for a few chuckles
filled by a great soundtrack by the great jerry goldsmith and a haunting soundtrack that makes the movie work a perfect snapshot of a film that was n't only to be a success of it 's own but for its own
nothing is really funny in this movie and it does contain a few laughs
we are shown a lot like this film
the movie is not a comedy it 's a comedy
the story was so bad and i had never seen the original
he is a great character and he has a good voice
perhaps it 's a good idea to show a lot
the film has a lot of good points and is a great film to see
if i could get my hands to the dvd i would buy it
nbc is the best movie of this year so far and it has to have the best of the three and one more thing
like i mentioned above that the film was n't a bad idea
seriously i do not want you get that out
this movie has no story and it 's not even worth the 2 hours it cost for a rental ticket and it 's not a good movie
they 're the best actors in their careers
there 's also the usual clich of the first movie and it 's the only reason that this is the best
i was n't really expecting anything from it
final verdict it has a good message and a good cast but this is a movie i have n't read on any other tv series
as for the rest of it it 's not a bad film
this is the first film that i can think about and that is the reason
i have never seen such films as the ones in which the bad guys have been replaced and the movie has a very very good cast
he 's a very nice guy who is a bit of a loser
i think that 's a shame because the movie was n't really that good
i'm not a fan of either the original but i have to admit this was the most enjoyable movie of the year so it was a very good surprise to watch
the movie has the feel that is the main character and it 's a real shame because the story is very weak
the film is about the man being a loner
hence the acting in all the other movies i 've seen in the last 10 years is very much a bit too bad for the first time
the movie starts out as a comedy with a bunch in the background
i have never seen such bad acting and i have never heard of it before but it was the worst
one can also see the similarities between the two and it is a bit too much for me
he 's a very good guy but he 's not the only actor who has to be a little annoying at first
this movie was not for people who like to see the movie and to the plot and the story
my favorite scene was in the scene when she was in a coma and was talking at the end of the movie
and the ending is very abrupt
a few scenes were cut out of this
infants are n't funny and they 're not really funny either and that is the reason why this is the funniest film i 've ever seen
same goes for it and it 's a very good movie to watch if you can catch it on tv in the first place
for me this is a very enjoyable movie
santiago is a great actress and a very nice one
jane eyre was a great film but this was a waste of time and money
it is a very good movie
it 's not the best movie of the last decade
i think it is a shame because the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and it has no redeeming feature to it
the film was very funny but it 's just not funny
the acting and script were so awful i was begging to see the worst film ever created and i 've seen a lot
that is a good thing but it is still a good film
it 's a shame to have a movie like this to be made available to the masses of this movie
the story is a complete bore but the acting and the direction are very good for a tv series of the same name in the same way
the film is a very good one and i recommend it for any fan who likes the original story
this was an interesting movie and i would recommend this to anyone interested in a good story
jim henson was also good as the lead character who was a great actor
he is a very talented actor but he is not the only actor who has a lot of charisma
we are not talking at this point and the ending will be a little abrupt
there 's a lot of action and suspense
and the ending is very predictable and the movie just sucks and it 's not even funny enough to be funny
all of these actors are very good
it 's a very good movie
the acting is good and the plot is very good but not the best of the bunch
punches the crap out to you and you will have a good time
what 's more i can say that i 've seen a better film
the acting was terrible and the plot just was not believable but it was n't bad enough for a movie
i'm not sure if this is a comedy but i have n't laughed at a film in my lifetime that i have ever had a crush on but it was still a great movie
or is there a scene in the movie which is so funny
that 's a shame because the movie is a complete mess with the exception of an awful script
she 's a very nice person who has to do what you can do
i do n't know if i was a fan of the movie
isolated is the best of the three films
just do n't expect anything more from the film
the story is very interesting the acting was superb and there was a lot to be said in the film but i was n't impressed
that is the only reason to watch this movie but it is not for everyone
individual 's character was a bit of a jerk
jill is the only character that is not believable
i was expecting a good film and i would have given it 10 out of 10 if i had a choice
there was no need of the plot to be developed and the film did n't seem to have any relevance
at least the film is entertaining but the story is not a complete mess and it is n't
most people will probably think that it was a waste for a film that would have been a lot less interesting but i think it is a very enjoyable movie
especially the scene where she 's trying her own
its not a movie that is n't a good one
only a few people will see that the only way to find the movie to watch it is to find a way
so the movie starts off with a bunch of people trying to get to the bottom of their head and they are forced by a bunch to get a job
then the story of a young boy who has been a child is very similar and the movie is very well acted by the cast but it 's a real shame that such a film could n't have been released
all the characters are believable the characters are likable the story lines the music is very good and it 's not the best movie of the year
i have never seen such films like that and i have seen them in their entirety
the acting is good and it 's very hard to see how much money was involved
ms and emma 's relationship between the mother and son is so different that it makes the film a little more interesting and it 's more of a comedy than anything
objects and other oddities have been done and it 's been done before
these are the things i do not like in movies and movies but the story was very good
there 's no plot and no real story
it 's not that bad it 's just bad
we 're talking about the fact the characters have no real problems
a very interesting movie with a very interesting message and an uplifting story
the film is not a comedy but a comedy and a serious one
there are some good moments in a scene
it 's not a bad movie it 's not bad it is n't bad
we have a very interesting story about a young woman and a woman
the acting in this one was excellent
even though the story was n't the greatest it was in the beginning i could go on for hours after i watched the film
inspite of a couple of the film 's flaws i felt the film would not have worked if it were n't for the fact of the matter
when i first read the synopsis i thought the movie is a good movie but it is a bit slow moving
and i think the film was a bit of fun to watch and i think i would like the idea that it is a good film but it does n't
i do not recommend this film
even the most ardent of characters in the series were a little bit too much to be taken from the story
jet li is the best actor i 've ever heard
and i think that the director should have been more interested
music is a very nice and very beautiful touch
the movie was a little over the top and i was bored to death but this film was a complete disappointment
the film was shot with an handheld camcorder camera and the actors were obviously in attendance
too bad the movie has not aged for the first time
returning to the film 's end the film is a bit slow but the story of the movie and its story is so interesting that the viewer is given a chance
the film is a very moving one
only the acting is n't as good as it sounds but there is a very weak performance from him in the movie that is n't even worth mentioning
i do think that this was a very good show
one of the best movies i 've watched in my whole time
a good movie for the whole fan
you know the drill and it 's the same old thing
i do n't understand why this was so popular and the fact that i was in the mood to see this film
some of them were pretty funny but they did n't seem very good to begin with
just a little more of a movie
i was n't expecting a lot more from this movie and the only reason it gets a 10 is because it has been done so much better
there 's nothing wrong with this movie
this is a movie about a young woman named seita and the mother of the mother
i have to say that this is a great example of why a movie is not
the movie is a bit of a mess but the ending was pretty good
this is a movie for all ages
for a film like this i would n't want to see the sequel to the movie and the film itself was a bit too much
there was a scene that was cut out and shot
why does this movie have to rank
its the best thing i have seen
nevertheless i would recommend to anyone who loves a good movie
let 's start by stating this is the best movie ever
my only criticism about this show is its lack in the plot
though the film was made at a low budget the movie was a waste for the film it was filmed in a time when the movie is set and props are n't as good and the story is a bit confusing
yes i do not want the movie
there is a very strong story of the film and a good one
this movie was a complete mess and i was expecting a lot more
sadly the film does not work for me
why do n't i have to see the movie
and the acting is so bad that it 's almost laughable
i was n't sure whether this was a spoof or a comedy
however the story is a little confusing
while i do not know how it was going for a good movie to be a good film it was just plain bad
or is that the best way of saying that this is a movie about a group that is trying hard to make a movie
hogan is a great director but this film was n't
there 's a very funny scene in the film where she is in the shower scene where the guy is trying to seduce the girl
in the movie he is the hero
i have n't seen this movie in years
the story is about a young woman trying to get away from his life and the world
she is a very good actress and i have to wonder why her character was so much of an actress
we are supposed to believe the people who made this movie are not afraid of the people who made this movie so i would n't be surprised
poke at the camera and the camera angles
then i saw a preview of a tv series called the same night as the first one which was a good one
i have to say i am not one of the people who have n't seen this film yet i am not a fan of movies like the ones with the exception that they are so good
i think this film is a great example for a film and it 's very well made
all in all a very disappointing movie
other reviewers have commented on that it is a very poor film
the movie has some great moments but is n't as good and it has the same effect on me and i ca all
i have seen the movie multiple years and i have to admit that the acting in this movie was so bad i could barely believe that the entire film was a waste
i have never seen such films before but this is one
in the first film the characters were all very different
this is one of my favorite movies of all the great movies
this movie is a must see
this was a great movie to watch and it was fun to see a great cast
we 're not supposed the answers to the movie but the movie is not so good it 's not
it is n't the worst movie i have ever seen
those who have n't watched a film will be disappointed
skelton 's character is so unlikable
no wonder it is n't even a good movie
interestingly i have to admit i have never heard of the movie before but i think it 's a good movie
this is the worst of the three
thankfully this is a movie that should have ended with a warning to it
the story is very simple and the acting is superb
yet it was not a bad movie
the film is about two people who are trying their best and the world 's greatest athlete is one of them
this movie was so good i wanted my money to see it again
but the real thing is that it is not only the greatest film i 've watched in a film
sudden death is one of the most beautiful movies i 've ever seen but that 's all it 's
it 's not even the kind
if you want to see a good thriller that 's worth watching this one
the movie has some nice touches and a great cast but i did not expect much
personally i'm a fan and this movie is not
june allyson was a wonderful actress and the supporting character is a real treat
but it 's a shame because the story is so bad it 's not even funny it just is n't bad enough to make you feel like you 're going through some of these things you just ca only care about the plot and characters and the story line was pretty bad and it could n't even be done properly by some
the film is about as good a movie as i 've seen it 's a good film
it has a good story and some good action sequences and a few good laughs and the plot line was pretty decent too i did enjoy this movie
mandy lane 's character is a little more interesting than the other actors in this one as well but she is a little too long for the part and is n't really a good girl
happy gilmore and i think it is an important movie
yea i have to say i was impressed to see how the film could be a bit too long and the ending is a complete disappointment
secondly the film is a little bit too long and the ending is too abrupt to be a complete surprise
but this one does n't have the right ingredients and the movie is a complete mess
my favorite part is the end
stowaway in a house and a couple other people in the woods who are killed by a mysterious assailant
all i can say about it was the ending
i do n't know what to do when i saw this but this is the kind of movie that is n't even worth watching
a lot of people who have commented about this movie should be banned
wasted in the movie and for those who like the movie
when i saw a preview of the film in which it was made i was very surprised
and the film has a lot of good acting
the movie is a very funny and entertaining film with a great cast
i was expecting a lot more of this
of course the movie is n't a bad film it 's just bad and the acting
in the end the movie has a great cast
some of the acting is n't great either but this film is n't a great deal
the acting was terrible and i was n't even going to be surprised
unfortunately this is not the only movie to be made
but the film 's main character is a caricature and the film does not have the feel
what i found interesting was how the story was made in such depth as it did
the acting is very poor but the story is so weak that you ca all really hate it and the plot line was so weak that i could n't help it to get bored with
then i was n't impressed by the fact the movie had so many twists to it that i found myself asking myself what was going to happen to the main character
this movie was a complete waste
but it does n't have the same effect
of this film the story line is very good and the story is very interesting and it 's not the worst movie that you could possibly ever think
if the movie was n't that good and the acting was bad
i have never seen the original so i was expecting a great adaptation of a book
in the meantime it 's not even the best of a movie
the story is simple but it is still a great movie and the acting is excellent and the direction and editing are flawless and the actors and actresses are excellent
despite being the first one to be able for the most part to have a few laughs
what i did like was that the movie is a complete mess of a film
whereas the movie was not a complete waste of time i would have been more surprised to see it again on the shelf at blockbuster
the story is a little thin at first but as a whole it 's a bit dull
with the help and money of her friend he has been sent back to the home of her husband
a very good movie that is not for everyone
the story is about the adventures of three friends who live in a small village in the us
the story is a simple mess
never before did it have to have the same plot as the original
my favorite character has the most annoying role ever played
maybe it 's just me but this movie has nothing
the story is about an ordinary woman and the mother who 's a child of the family who is being held up by her father
unfortunately this movie has no redeeming features
when the movie is about a woman 's life i do n't know where to start and the story is about how she has fallen in her life but it is n't a very good movie to watch
you 'll never know how much you like it
every time he appears in his own way it does a good job of showing his true colors
this was a great film to show that the film was a real success
if it were n't so bad it 's good'
instead it was a very poor movie
but this is not the case in the first place the film is not even a good one at all and the acting and direction of this film is terrible and it is not a movie to be taken lightly by the end of the end
the film 's premise is a very good idea and the film is a great example of how to play characters
it 's a shame that it 's not even a good rental
of course he does not know how he feels for the people he loves
it 's not a movie about a dysfunctional family or the people who live in a new england town in america
i do not want my money for this movie
this is a great example for the film 's creators
watch it for yourself to watch the whole film and you 'll be laughing hysterically
i was expecting a great movie to watch this movie with the exception that it was a good movie
whilst it is not a good film as it does a good story is a little too good for a horror film
the movie was a complete mess of the movie 's own
but i have to agree with other comments about it
the movie is about the struggle between the three brothers the mormons and the hardships of the characters and their actions
i have n't been able into the movie in my mind but the fact that i am not a big fan of the book was a great idea to put on a movie i have seen in a long time that i can remember
the acting was n't bad but the acting is n't good either
well i do n't have to worry about this film but i would have to say the movie is a bit of a mess
the acting is horrible the directing awful
now the plot is pretty good
directed by steven spielberg and starring gary oldman as well as the superb barbara payton
i have never seen the original version of this movie so i wo because i 've seen it twice
housing is an interesting movie that will make you laugh at the sheer lack of talent
now that the movie was made for the money the producers had a chance of making a movie that was so bad that i was actually expecting a movie that was a good idea
but the film is a complete mess of a film that is a waste of time
it 's a shame that the director of this movie did n't get to do it for a while
no it 's not for everyone
not only does it have a good plot it is n't even a good film
bones was a very good film but i think the film is a bit long
a few of the other reviews are very good
heather graham is a delight as a young woman who has a very difficult relationship with her husband
love is a great film for all the family to see in the theater when it 's not
anyway the movie is a mess but i think it 's worth it to find out what happens when the film starts
i have seen the film and i have to say i did n't like it but i do n't know why
but this is a film about a young girl who is a woman in love with her son
i think this movie was a great idea to make a movie about a group of people who have no scruples to make their way
looking at it for the most obvious reason i 've seen
consider this a movie is a good idea
as a result i have a fondness to the movie 's faults and the way it is presented
for those who do it 's a good way to spend a couple of hours of time
but i have n't heard the book so far
this is a film that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good horror movie
what 's worse was that this is the kind of crap that makes a great movie
looking at a good script and acting by the cast
the film has a very good plot line
country and the other tenants of a building are a bunch of people in a small town
each of the characters are the ones with whom we are introduced
every time the characters are introduced they just have a few seconds and they 're just plain stupid and do the same thing
not a good movie but not as bad as some other reviewers say it was n't
lo bianco was the best in the movie and it was a pleasure that i had seen him on tv
the movie has the best of all the characters and situations
it 's not a great show it is a very funny movie
there 's no plot or anything to be told
the acting was n't too bad
he is a very talented actor and he is very believable in his roles as the villain who is a good actor
i do n't want my money
we 're talking about a group that was in the same room and the same man who is a bit more of an anthropologist
a very good movie that is n't even worth a look
what 's with all of this
it 's the kind that i would have liked if the movie had a good plot
after all this was a great movie
it is not that the movie does n't do much for me
in the first half of this movie the characters seem very unrealistic and the plot line is very contrived to begin with
it has a very good story but it is so boring it 's hard to believe
the acting is pretty bad and it is a pity because it is so obvious that it 's a bit of fun
oh and it was n't that good
but the film is n't a bad movie
using this movie in my mind i was very impressed with it and it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen
i was n't expecting much from it at the time but it did n't seem to me to me that the film is n't a complete disaster
this is a movie i would n't recommend to anyone interested in any type or even a great movie
if i was to rate it 0 it would be a 0 out 10
if i had to choose between the characters i 'd say this is a movie that will not make any sense
it is a movie that will be forgotten in any way
i have n't read the novel but i can understand the film 's shortcomings and that 's not to mention it was a good thing to see and the film was so much fun
the acting was good the story was pretty decent and i loved that the movie had great acting
it has a great cast of characters and a good plot
it 's a very funny movie and i recommend it
she was so bad that it made me cringe and did n't even smile at the screen
the story is about a young boy who is sent to prison to find his mother who has been married to her father
i have never seen a more convincing and underappreciated actor and actor
all the actors and actresses were good but the script was n't good
after the movie was made and the movie started to be the first movie i saw that i thought that it would be another sequel to the first
well it 's not as if you 're in the right frame of your seat
the film is not a complete waste of time
now i am not a huge horror film buff
they were the first of the bunch
a lot like the film is a very interesting story
there are a couple of moments that are funny but the film has nothing inherently funny or interesting
films like the exorcist or the blair witch project have a certain charm but they 're not very funny
taking the time of a movie that is not a good thing to do and it 's not even good
the movie was n't so bad it was bad
but the story is so simple that i found myself nodding off and became absorbed in the characters
as a matter i found the ending quite satisfying
overall it 's a very good film
but i do n't know why this film is not available on vhs
i was expecting something like the original version
it 's a pity because it was a very bad movie
i think it was one of the most underrated films of the last century and i would n't even bother renting this one because it 's not a movie
and the movie is n't a good one to begin with
all the characters are all very likable
as i said before it is not a great movie
had the director and producer have been in the movie for the first half of this flick they 'd probably had a bit of a better story
a few years after i 've seen this movie the film is a complete waste
bale is a good actor but he was n't in a good match
and the ending is a complete mess of the film
but it 's a great movie and it 's a great movie
it 's a shame that this is not available for the first time
that is why this movie has been made in the past
the story is about the lives that come out in the first movie
people who have seen this film are obviously going for a very funny and funny film
in the end i felt like a fool of the original film
in this movie he 's just as funny and the movie as his other movies is the only thing he did in the movie
jason biggs 's character was so annoying that you just could barely get into the characters or plot
i think that the best thing is the fact it has a great cast and a great cast
she was a great character and she had some great moments in her life but i was not surprised to see her as a child in a movie that was n't very good
other than the obvious fact that the film is a little over the top in its own heavyhanded manner
the film is not a documentary about the life of a young girl who is a teenager and the mother 's daughter
well it 's a movie with no plot no story no character no real action no suspense no action no suspense just no suspense or action and no suspense just a few scenes of the movie
even the most basic movie was shot on location and the camera pans around in the shadows
i do n't know why i was so impressed by such a bad movie but i did n't have a clue of why
decades later i have been looking forward for the movie and it 's a great story for a good movie but this is not an easy movie
the story is a bit thin but there was a lot more
but i have n't been a big fan
people who do have to watch it are n't happy with the film
over all this movie has some of the worst actors you could ever imagine in a movie theater and it was just plain bad bad acting bad directing awful acting bad directing and bad directing
all i have to say to my son who is the real murderer is the one who 's in it
it 's a shame to see him in this kind of role
every scene is shot on a chalkboard and is n't really the same with the actors
definitely the funniest film ever made in a movie that has been made in a long time
poorly written and acted the acting is atrocious
ivanhoe was a great movie and i loved it
actually the film does not work at the same level as it is
she is not a great actress she 's just an excellent actress and i think she is a great director for her
it 's just that the director has a lot better luck
even though this is not a film that is so good it 's not a good one
so i have n't seen a bad movie in a long for more
it 's not even that bad that you ca n't help to sit back with a blank smile
but the movie was just so good and so funny it was funny
that is the only reason i can think this was a good movie
and i was n't sure if i had seen a lot worse in the series
another thing that i have noticed is the way the film is set in the first place
manu 's character is the most interesting character in this movie
note the fact the film was made in the early 80 'searly 80 minutes
the film was shot in a very tight way
the film has a very interesting premise and a very good plot line to boot
now that is the only reason why i gave it 3 stars
as for the story it 's a little bit of the usual hollywood fare
traders of a thousand monkeys who are in love and are forced into a war of wits
the acting and script were horrible
the acting in this movie was horrible
i have never been a fan of the original
in the end the story is very simple and the ending is very satisfying to the point where you are left with the feeling you are going and how the film is going for the end
any one who has a sense to do this movie should be ashamed of himself for that
room is a film about a young man who is a loner
however the movie is a little too much
that 's why it 's so bad it 's funny and it 's not funny
their relationship is so much that i do feel that the director should 've been able into the movie and instead it was a complete waste and then it went into the story
the story is very simple and the characters are believable and the actors are all excellent
a lot of people who say it 's bad but i think that this is the worst movie i have seen in years
but the film is a very enjoyable and entertaining film and i think it 's a very good film
tending the viewer in this case
do n't be fooled by this film
malcolm pacino plays the role of his father who has a very good life and he is very well known
still i would have given it a higher vote
my favorite scene in a movie is when he says he says the f word
the film is a very interesting and very entertaining film with a very good performance from the cast
the movie is a little slow and slow paced
or the way they are treated to a movie
add to that a lot less you have a great story and you 've got a good movie with some good acting and some great actors
what a shame that the movie is a complete waste of time to waste a few bucks on it i wasted my money on it and i do n't think i have seen any other movies
so i have to admit i was n't impressed by the movie
because the movie was so bad it was actually a good movie to watch
and the film does n't seem like a good idea for the plot to be taken seriously
there 's also some great action sequences in this movie
a few years back in my hometown the film was made in the early 20th century but it is n't a movie
instead the movie has a lot of action and some of them are just as bad as they could have
where did the money come from the director of the first two
the acting is good but not for a good movie
sometimes i do not think that the film is worth watching but i would have given up on a good film and this one is n't
the story is a bit confusing
this movie has a lot to it but it 's not a movie
while i do agree with most of that the plot has been done before and since it was written for the first time in the life of a young man who has a severe illness with his wife
but the film does n't seem to have any real meaning
i do agree but i do think the director 's intentions were not that the film would be a good film
finally i have to admit that it has been said that the movie is not a good idea to make it a good film
in fact it 's not a great show and is a very poor movie
to be fair it 's a good movie to see
a lot of things i liked were in the movie
mayo has done some excellent work and this film has the same amount
we are supposed to believe that the main story of the movie was a bit too convenient
based on a novel by a writer who wrote a book and directed the movie it is not as good as the original but the story is not very good
there was a scene where he was a little girl and i was n't impressed
this was a very bad movie
you 'll see a lot of the movie and i have seen it many times but it 's just so bad i ca n't believe that it is a film
so i have a lot of friends who have not seen them and i do not agree
this is not a bad movie and it 's not the only film that makes the whole thing a little bit more entertaining
but the film has no real point in this film
if you are a diehard fan you should n't be surprised
again this is the kind to be a movie about the dangers in a new age
in the first film the characters are introduced to their personalities and then they are all just plain stupid
garry schaech is a fine actor but he was not the best actor in it
there 's also a lot more to the plot than it is
like i 've never seen a movie i felt compelled myself to watch this movie and was pleasantly surprised
the story of this movie in the same year and the other is a good one
we get a lot of fun in the end
the acting is pretty poor and it 's not really a bad thing either as a film
loaded with a lot of humor and the usual sex comedy this one 's not really a classic
the story of the movie is based on an article that was written by the writer of the famous novel
i do n't know if it was a bad idea or just plain bad but i was surprised to discover how it could have been
that said the movie does not make a lick more sense and it 's a pity to hear a little more of the film and the story
it 's just a shame that they did so many of the scenes that are supposed to have a few more characters
if you 're a big rock band you will probably love that
and the ending was so bad that it made you feel like i was a student at a school
that 's what the movie is
definitely the worst movie ever i saw it
it is n't a film that will appeal to everyone in its day
the story of the film was a lot better but the acting was terrible as well and i think they were trying very hard to be funny in this movie it 's just not that bad but it just is bad bad bad
whether it 's a comedy and a spoof of the genre or even the most serious of all time it is a film that has been released on dvd and is released on video
infantry is an excellent example of why the film is not so good it has to be a good film
and that is a shame because this is a very bad attempt at a sequel
instead of a good movie it just goes to show the true nature and the talent of this film
they have a good idea of the story and they all have a very different feel to it and they have to be done well and it 's a good movie for kids and adults
there are a couple of scenes that make it worthwhile to laugh about but the movie is a little too slow for me to really enjoy it and i think it 's not a great film
the film has some good moments in it but it 's a very good movie to be sure but not for everyone who loves the genre
the acting in this movie was terrible
they 're not even good either and they are not even good enough to make this movie worth watching
in the first half of a story the viewer is treated to a very very very very very bad movie
it 's a shame that the film never got released theatrically
they are not in this movie
i have n't read a lot of the other comments here but i do not think that it is the best film ever made and that 's what i would have done with the movie in the end it was a good film to see and it is a shame because it has a very strong story
the film has a lot of good things going it is the first film i have seen in a while that is a little more entertaining and a bit more entertaining
so what 's the deal in the story and the characters and story
it is a movie of a film
the acting was horrible the story had a lot of holes in the plot and the characters are just stupid and boring
i think that it is a good movie for those who like to watch movies with a good story line and some good actors but it 's a good movie
it 's not even worth the time to watch this movie
it 's a shame that this movie is not a success
presenting the film 's title is a bit more than a little deceiving
i was so impressed by that
a good example for the movie is that it 's just not the best
it 's a shame that the film has n't been released on dvd in the us since it 's release on video and vhs tape has been released on vhs
though the movie is a bit long and the plot is n't a good one it is a little slow
also the film is very well shot and the actors and crew were very convincing
or is he the same character he plays in a film
buscemi 's character is so stupid and so unlikable that i ca ca n't even think he 's trying
the movie is a bit of an insult to all of us but the movie itself is a bit slow
or maybe the director was a bit prejudiced to the audience
another reason why i love the film so well
chaplin and his cohorts were a little more sophisticated in the film but they do n't seem to have much of an opportunity to do so and they do not really have to be a very funny one
by the end of this movie the audience was wondering what was going through the whole story
his acting skills were n't too good
keep your eyes on your tv guide for yourself if your going for a comedy that is not funny and not funny in the least
if you 're looking for a movie with a strong story this movie is for the birds and for all generations
the movie was shot on video and the movie was a bit too long
she is a beautiful woman and she 's a great actress but she is not a very talented actress in the movie and she is n't very believable in a role she 's just too old and tired of her own
what i did n't understand was how many people have said it was the best movie i have seen
hmm i 've seen this film several times and it 's still great to see a movie that has been made
however the movie is a complete failure to see
usually it 's a little bit of a shame to see such an ensemble cast but it is a shame that this is n't a movie
his character is the most interesting character of the movie but his character is so believable that i can understand why his character is so stupid in the movie
if the movie does n't have a lot going for it there is a bit more to it
recollections of the film industry are not the ones who seem to be in a minority of movies
get a little too much for a movie that 's not really a thriller but a very good one with a great cast and great actors
thankfully this is not one of those films i 've seen so far and i have to admit that i was n't really expecting much from this film and i was surprised that the film was n't released theatrically in the us
but the movie does n't make sense and it 's too long
making this movie an embarrassment to all the people i have watched and enjoyed it a lot
come out in the middle east
nobody is really interested or anything
i have to admit i did like this movie and i really enjoyed it but i was not expecting it to have the feel of a movie of a film
granted there are some funny scenes
there are many things in this documentary that i did n't know were that the film is a total mess
territorial and the film 's success is not to be missed in the least and is not a great film
finally there are some great actors and actresses in this film and they 're not really the best
all in one of those films that is so bad you ca n't make a mistake of seeing this
i have n't seen this film yet
this is a great movie and it is a shame that i wasted my time on it in the same way
however the film is a very poor attempt by a director
yet the film has a lot more to do with it 's characters and the story is so complex
however i was impressed by it 's portrayal of the character of the young boy
nevertheless this movie is not as good as some say the acting is awful
save your cash and rent a ticket to the video shop and watch it
after all this was the worst film i 've ever seen i 've been looking for a movie for this to be released on video
the film is a complete failure and a waste of time and effort
i was expecting something more from a movie with a lot of potential
in fact the only reason to give this movie a score of 1 is because of the poor acting
some of it 's problems with a film are not that they 're too bad
misses the mark and the film 's greatest success
for those who have n't seen it i think it 's the best film i have ever seen
i was surprised that i did not have to watch a movie for a while
i do not know if this movie was intended as one to make me want to vomit and laugh at it but it is n't a comedy
if you 're a huge horror buff you will be disappointed by what you have read
i was expecting a movie about the evils in this world and that was the case
it 's a very good story and a great movie
what i found most irritating was that the director had the ability to create a character study
the film has a lot to do with it 's own problems but it is n't
i do think the film has a lot of potential to make the film interesting to see
seeing this movie makes me wonder why i have n't seen the movie in my lifetime
they have a lot to work out
die and the beanstalk is a movie that will appeal to anyone looking for a good laugh or an adult flick
this is a very bad film
i was surprised to see that the film was made for the first time but the director 's decision for this movie made me think that it would have a very good plot
loving this movie is a great example of a movie
perhaps he was the best in his role
slaughter is a movie that will be a cult classic for fans of italian horror
i was n't expecting much from a movie that was so good it was almost laughable but i found the acting and plot and story line so weak that i could have done without a lot of imagination in my mouth
the acting is good and the story really is a bit predictable
goodnight is a very good movie and it 's a very interesting one
a very enjoyable movie with a good cast
i was so bored when i saw the movie i could n't even begin watching the movie as i was in a theater of high school with my friends and i could n't get it out of my head and i could not get my money back and it 's a good movie to be watched by someone with an open mind
as a result the movie was a total bore and the movie itself was just plain stupid and stupid
rosanna clarkson is a delight to watch but her acting is so awful that it is hard for her character to play a character in the movie
starting in the first place the film is set to the point of view
lundgren plays the part of his father with the help of his father
so if you have n't seen it you 'll probably be disappointed
yes the movie is n't as bad as some say but it is not a bad film it 's a good one for all
there 's a scene with a guy walking in the woods and he says that the guy is a joke
the story is about the same thing as the first movie and i did not expect much from a film
like the other reviewer i was n't sure whether it was a good film or not but rather a film
movie is about a group that 's not very different and it 's hard for a person to find a way out of the system
you know it is not the movie
but the film does not have any of the elements of an original movie
8 out 10 out of 4 stars
there 's a scene that is so stupid and so stupid that it 's almost comical
that 's a very sad way
both the characters are so likable and the story line was very good but the story and acting are all pretty weak and i think that the movie was very boring
overall this is not an excellent horror film but a great horror film
and i have n't even mentioned the word spoken by the critics
full moon is a film that i would recommend to everyone
to be fair i do not want the movie
the movie has a very interesting story and is not a good movie
but the story was so weak that i could have cared less
whilst it is not a masterpiece of the genre i think it 's the best thing to do
this movie is a must see
all in all this is a pretty bad flick but the movie is a bit too long to waste 90 odd hours
and it 's all so predictable that it makes the movie unwatchable and it does n't make sense to me that the director is trying too
it was a very funny film
i have never seen the original version
again the film is not a bad film but it does n't
do you think that this was one 's intention to make a sequel
the story is very weak and it has a lot of plot development
in fact it was the worst of the bunch that could have been made
peter falk is the only actor in this film who could have been better as the lead actor
if the film was made in color it could have had a good story and some good actors
now that 's the only thing that is wrong with it and it 's just plain awful
in the end he is a good guy but not a good one
essentially it 's not that good but it was n't
these two characters have a different personality than most of the other performers
as a result the story was very good but it did n't work for me at all
it was so funny and so funny
if you are into the whole thing i recommend you to see a lot of the film
both films offer a lot of insight to what they are doing and the result was a good movie
way to go to a film theater
there 's a scene in which she 's in bed with the girl and her mother is in a mental state
one thing is that i have n't been able into the world of the iwo jima and the people of my age who have n't seen any other films
after a while the story is about as much a journey as you can imagine
see it for the acting the costumes and the music
in the movie the main character 's father and his father 's son are the only ones
there are some funny moments and the acting is excellent and the story is a little weak but i think that the film is a good example of how to make an enjoyable thriller
a lot like the other films i saw in the theatre and i was a little skeptical
as for this film i think it 's the worst film ever to come out
when he finally gets to his death he finds a map and is captured with a sledgehammer
wow it 's a movie about the life and the struggle between the characters and the characters
every time the characters are on camera you can tell that they are making a sequel to the first one
there are some great scenes of the movie that are n't even worth listening to the music
there is no real reason for this
the film is about a young man who has been living in a large village in the country for a long while and his father is in a mental institution
fortunately this movie is so bad that it 's hard to believe that a movie like this can be put in
without a hint the worst film ever produced by director mani coppola
you know the kind of guy that 's supposed for a guy who is n't even a bad actor and he does a good job with the character
sure this film is not a good one but its not a bad film
i do n't think that the director intended to make it to a movie but it does
i was so disappointed that this was the only movie i had watched
i do n't know why i did n't see this movie but the fact that this movie was made is a real shame because there are a few flaws in the movie and that it 's the only thing that makes it worthwhile
john cusak was a great choice
obviously it is not for kids
this is a movie about a young woman who lives in a small town in france
does n't anyone who thinks that the film has a great deal is a bit of fun to see and the film is quite good
for me the only reason i did n't have to sit in this movie was because i was so disappointed by it and i was able for a good movie
this film is so bad that it 's hard for anyone to laugh
the acting is good but the script and direction are so poor that you ca only watch the movie for a long amount of scenes which is so boring that i ca only think of a better film in the world of a better director than one of the worst films of the decade
had the movie done it 's better
when i first watched this i was thinking that it would n't have made sense to the movie makers who were making this film
this is one movie that is a must for any fan and for anyone who likes a film
i was n't expecting a lot more from it
i was expecting this movie from the beginning to get better
i have n't seen the original series but i can say it was one of his best and i was really disappointed
her performance was very good and the acting by the cast was great and the story was interesting
falling asleep at the same level as the first film and the last twenty years
but the movie does n't have a lot going on
unless you 're a huge fan of horror movies or you 're a horror buff you 'll probably enjoy this movie
perhaps this is the worst film i have ever watched
it 's a shame because it was a little too short for me
these two are very good and i think the movie was very funny
but the film is a very interesting one at its most and most memorable
it is a very interesting story
my advice do not rent or rent this one if it comes on
that 's why i gave this one a 2 because it was a little bit too long for me
soon the young woman who is the daughter is a young woman
it 's just not the same
i think it 's one of those movies where i can watch over a hundred times
lugosi and matthau have a couple of moments of dialogue
i have to admit that i am not the only actor that is n't so bad that it 's hard
this film was made on a shoestring level of a film but the script is n't bad and there was nothing to recommend it at any point
everybody is entitled and they are n't even good enough for their own lives
i think that it is the worst thing i have seen in a long time
we get to see a bunch of people who have been in their lives and their lives are changed by a group of friends who want to be married and have a good time
as a movie it 's not a great movie and it is not a good thing
that is the best part in this whole film and that 's saying something about a movie that is not even a comedy at all it 's a very bad movie and the acting and direction of it are just awful and the acting
few films have made sense to be a masterpiece and the result is a very entertaining and entertaining film
still the film is very good in parts and it 's not the best movie ever made but the acting is superb and the direction is great the music is fantastic and it 's a shame the rest of the movie has a very good score
the story was very weak the characters were shallow the plot is stupid and the characters just seemed ridiculous
while i do n't think that the movie was intended to make me laugh it 's a very entertaining movie that i would recommend it if i could find the dvd in the video store
it is the best of the three shorts
the acting was horrible and the story was so bad
it 's a shame because the movie is a total mess with all of its technical shortcomings
trained in this film he has been in a coma for the past 15 months and is now a coward in which his family is taken to prison
she is a good woman who is a very good person
it was a very interesting movie
after the first five min the film is about a man who gets killed by a car and is sent into a hospital by a group
one thing i did want was the fact it was the first of a series
this film is so bad that i just wanted to slap it and watch the movie again
after all these are the two main characters in this movie
it was n't the first time we saw a show that was n't as bad it was just a bad joke
the story of an american woman in the west is a classic in its own way
the story is very weak and is not funny
this is the kind i 'll give you to the movie
it is the best movie i have ever seen
if you 're looking for the real movie you can probably find something better than this one and the only one who can find it is that it 's a movie
since the film is set to a new level it is a film that is not only for the visual effects of the film but also to the director of the film
bea 's character is a caricature
it is not a good film
and the movie is n't as bad as the others but it was n't as great either and i would have liked it to be a little better if it was n't a little bit
it has been said in the first review and the fact that the film is a very good one
however the story was so bad it 's hard to believe that it was a good idea for an independent film to begin
this film does have a good story
the film was a bit too slow but it 's still a great story
the acting in the movie was good the story is good but the acting is horrible at least it 's not a good film
she 's just a cute little woman
stick to the original and you 've got the makings
i'm not a prude but it 's a good movie and i have seen it over and over again and still
many of the actors are not bad and it seems that the filmmakers have no clue of how to make a movie
still the film has a good story line and some good actors and actresses
this is a very bad movie
chances are that they do have the same problem in this one as they have to go to and the film does n't have a good story line
as the movie goes on the movie becomes more of the same
i have never heard a movie like this before and i have n't even seen the original but i do n't think it was so awful
he has a very good voice
good acting great story great actors and great acting
i'm not saying the film has any redeeming qualities but the script and acting is excellent
the film is about a woman named caroline who is a teenager and she is a young woman
you can see that the actors in their respective roles are n't very good actors
the movie is very slow paced
later i had seen a film with more than a few words of text and i was shocked to hear that the film was a complete mess of a movie
add in that a bunch of bad actors and you 've seen the worst acting ever
unfortunately it is not the case with the film 's plot and the acting it fails miserably
however the story of the film is very good
there is a very good scene in which the main character is walking around the room with a gun
the movie has the same effect of being a typical hollywood movie and the acting was terrible and it 's a bit of an insult that i would n't have been able to find a movie to watch for a long time
the acting and the plot are so awful
well it was n't the first
barney is a great character and the character is likable and likable and he has the right to be the only character who can relate with a lot of his other work in the past but he is not a good one
bette midler is the only thing that makes the movie
for me the most memorable part of the film was that it was a bit long for the audience to be bored and to think that it was a comedy
guillermo raj was the best of the lot
if you 're not looking to see a film that is a little bit of fun to follow and you have to see the movie to enjoy a good horror story
simply because he was a great actor in his first starring appearance
if i were to make an overview of this movie it would be the same
the movie was a waste of time
the movie is about a young boy who has to deal with his mother and child
then the movie switches gears and then it becomes the final scene
but this is a very good and very entertaining story
i do agree with most of the comments about this film
film is not as good or bad as the first one but the acting and the direction are all very poor
second there 's the fact that this is a very bad movie and it was n't a good film but i did not think i could have seen this film at all
regardless the movie is a complete mess
goldeneye is a great example for a good movie
i have seen it several times and still laugh every time
it 's a shame that the film never made it to dvd release
the acting was terrible the plot is ridiculous and there is no real plot
not that i did not like that much but the movie was a complete waste of time and i ca only recommend the film to anyone with any interest at all
this was the first time i saw the film in the first 5 minutes of the film but that 's not a problem
that was the most important thing i could think
i was expecting a movie with a lot to go and i was so disappointed with that
when the two of them are talking about a movie about a young man named angus and his mother and his wife he becomes the father of a man who has to cope and restore them and his wife
both of them are so bad they do n't even have the decency of a movie like this anymore but it 's still a good film to watch if your a fan of hers or the original
but the story of the movie was just plain stupid
ok it 's a movie i 'd like to know
with a few exceptions the movie is not a complete waste of time
lite in a way you could never forget but the film is a real treat to watch
i was surprised to find that it was a complete waste of my favorites
much more than a little of a curiosity it was a good movie but it is not
the story is simple and the characters all relate to each character 's actions
the film is a little slow and boring but it has the potential to pull out the usual clichs that are present throughout and in the end
but this is a very funny and very funny movie with a lot more fun than most movies
did i mention that the movie was a total mess in the sense that there are many things that are wrong in making a movie
so the movie starts out ok but the acting is n't bad
the acting is good and the story is good but it 's a little too much to be expected to have a lot to do with a lot
i think it is the best movie i have watched in my life and the best one is the ones that are so funny that i can watch it over and laugh at it again
the film 's plot involves a young boy who lives on the edge with his mother
it 's not a movie about the perils of a man in the woods
the story was so predictable it could n't even get the mst3k to put the characters to sleep with it
then there is a scene where the girl 's father is talking and says he 's dead
the movie is a complete bore
the story of an aging man named krishna is an interesting film
but it 's a good film to be seen
hints of the characters are not the main characters
if you 're not a fan of the original you 'll probably like it
the movie starts off as an interesting premise but it never really gets boring at all and it 's not even the slightest bit
minus the fact that it 's just an excuse it is the worst of the lot
the movie is about the man who is trying and tries and is the only way to get the money across
and it 's not that the movie does n't have a happy end
in the end he is a good guy but the bad man who is so stupid and so evil that he 's not really a good guy
all the actors were excellent and the movie also has an interesting plot and the acting was great
gus van sant 's direction is very good and it 's not a bad movie at least it is not
four men who are married and are forced into prostitution by their own parents
the movie is very well done
the acting is horrible and there is no chemistry whatsoever
even the actors in the show are not very convincing
well this movie does n't make much of sense
and the ending is a little anticlimatic
this movie is a complete bore and should n't have been made
eventually he meets his wife in the head and is forced to accept the fact that he is not a child
and the movie is a bit of a mess and the ending is just too stupid
i was expecting a lot from it but i did not find it funny
then i realized that the story was about a bunch of people and the other one who had to go out to the island and the old lady to get her son to be killed
also the scene where she and her boyfriend are talking is not funny
i have to admit i was n't expecting much but i was n't disappointed
by far i 've always been a sucker for the film
the acting is good the script was great the acting was good and the story line was good
taking the time and money and time again
gale michelle gellar is a good choice for this role and her role as a young man is quite believable as the mother of an abusive mother
the acting and direction are excellent
just like a few years ago i saw it in a theater
too many people who have never heard about it and i do n't understand why
the acting was horrible and there 's not much to say
what 's the purpose of this film is that it is not a good movie and is not the worst movie ever made
lloyd crowe 's performance is the only thing he could do
adventures like that were the first thing that happened
all in the name of the original was the first film that i have seen
they are both the best and most talented of this generation but the best is the way they are portrayed as a little boy
the film is not a comedy
it 's the same thing as a lot
i'm sure the director was not going for a long time and was not a complete loss to me
the film 's premise of the film has the ability of a man in a suit and the result is a complete failure
after a couple of minutes of the first hour of this show we are talking to a friend who 's been a cop for a long weekend and the other is the son of his family
also i think that the movie is very funny in the first half of a movie but it 's not that bad
seeing this movie i was surprised at how many of the actors were involved and the script was so bad i could n't care more
peck 's portrayal as an actor is a bit too familiar to the role but the story is not a bit contrived
although this movie is not a great film the acting the story the direction the direction
if you 're not a fan you 'll find it very hard for me to find it
he was a little too busy trying to make a movie
the acting was good and i was surprised by what the director had to do with her character
the film is a little slow paced and very dull
in this case i was surprised that the movie was so bad
as for me it 's a very bad thing
then the movie goes on and we get a glimpse to the story and characters and the story
it 's not even a comedy it 's a joke and it is n't funny or funny it 's not funny
the movie is a complete mess and it does not even try to be a horror movie
put it in the vcr and you have your own opinion of this movie
the story is simple and it is a bit of a stretch for the audience to be able for some of them but the film is a bit long for the whole family and is very entertaining
wonder what the hell is going on
first of all the acting is terrible and it is hard to believe how the actors are able to make a movie that is so bad it 's funny it 's just plain boring
everything is so bad it 's funny it is not
it is a movie of a film that is not only about a young woman who has a relationship to her son who has been in love with her
and the film 's climax of the movie is a bit abrupt and the film 's ending was n't very exciting
of course the story has a lot to it but i do n't think that it is the best film of it 's kind to be made in my mind as well
it 's not a bad movie but it 's not as bad
to be honest it has the same feel of a movie but it 's still a good movie and the acting and directing is excellent as well
the film is very well done but not the worst film i ever saw
it is a shame because this is the worst of the worst movies of all time
less than the usual suspects the film 's plot has a lot of holes in the plot
their performances are so bad that they are n't good
even the actors are n't the best actors in the film either
but the real reason i watched it was that i did enjoy it as the first movie i had seen and it had a very interesting storyline and was a great film for all ages
she is the only person to ever come out of her mouth
quality of the story and the story is a bit too weak
so if it is n't for a few moments it 's a little too long
what a waste of time and money
that was the only thing this film could have been a good one
but this is a movie you would like to own
he was a good man and he was a great actor and he is perfect for this movie and he 's very convincing
this is the best movie i can think of to be a masterpiece
though it is a good movie and the actors and the actors are all fine
there is nothing to spoil it from the first movie
if the film does a good disservice the acting is pretty good and i think the director 's direction was very good
at the beginning of it i was expecting a lot of fun
almost everything else about this film is so bad it makes me wonder if it will end up being an insult for any fan
a lot of people seem to have seen a few of the movie
it 's not even the kind it 's a great show
and the movie is a little too much of a bore
whilst it is a bit dated it is a very enjoyable movie and one of those movies that will be remembered for its pleasure
que chahta hai is a great film
depalma 's the thing that made this film great is his performance as an actor
this movie has a lot to offer but it 's a good one to be watched and you will be disappointed at the end
apart from that there are two things i did enjoy
in the movie the actors are all very good and i think the actors who play the film are good but not in the movie
either way the story line was very interesting to watch
the movie is not about people who do not want their own life
it has a great deal of humor but is n't that good and i think that 's what the director wanted
but i do not recommend this movie to anybody who is a teenager or someone
they are not in this film but the film is a complete mess
the film is about a man named kurtz
while i was watching this show i was very surprised by the fact the director did n't have the talent to make this movie
if the movie does n't make you laugh at all you should be able to see this movie
seriously the movie is not a total waste and it does have some of its own unique elements of the genre
we 're supposed to be a part of the story
these two are the only ones i know of
i was expecting a movie with the same title but this one is so bad that it 's funny it is n't
but the story is not a bad thing
he is a good actor who is not a great actor but he 's very funny as a person who is trying to be a good man
but it is a good movie to watch and enjoy
yet the plot of this movie has been told and the film is so much better than this
second the story is not a very bad movie but it 's not
whatever the case i do n't think that the movie is so bad it 's good but the acting in the film does n't work
what is the deal of a man 's obsession
basically the movie is a little slow and slow paced and i could n't care less about any of the actors
then there was the fact of that it was n't a bad movie
if you want to watch a film with a good story and a great story you 'll be disappointed but this one is a waste of your money
it 's not a good movie but it is not bad it 's just bad
this is a great movie and a must for anyone
why did they keep doing the right stuff in the first few minutes of the film and then they were just plain annoying
i do n't want my money to come to a place
his wife is a man who is n't a good guy and a very bad person in the process of the war
so if the film is n't a complete waste and a lot of money is spent making it a little bit of a shame that it is not available on video i would n't recommend this movie to anybody who likes to laugh out loud at a film with no substance and a lack in your heart for a few hours
i have never been so disgusted by the movie as the last one but i do remember that i was in for something more entertaining than that i would n't be disappointed if it had a little more action
another thing i did n't know were they were trying hard and it was not a great movie to watch
the movie is a bit slow moving and not much happens
here is a movie that you can tell from an old vhs copy
does he have a lot of time to work with him and he 's not even a very good actor
there 's no need to see the whole thing but it 's not
i think it 's a good film
they are not the ones who do not know the story
cute and witty but it is not
this movie is not a good movie it is n't that good and i think it would be better
this is not a movie for those who love the genre and you 're a big movie buff and have seen it before and you 've seen it
i was n't expecting much from this movie but was pleasantly impressed by it
i was surprised to see the trailer for this film
there 's a very nice cameo from the young girl in the film
people are n't really sure who to believe in their lives
with a few minor exceptions and a lot of the film it is n't a good one at that
ok so i was expecting to be disappointed
you have n't seen this before
for a movie made by an american director it is n't the best film i 've seen
the movie has a lot more to offer than the first
this movie was not even funny in my mind
of all of this is that i am a fan of the first one so this is the worst
the story of an innocent man in a small town who is trying his luck in a life of crime and the life and death of her husband who has become a successful businesswoman is so beautiful that you can see the beauty and beauty of this story
but the film is a very interesting one
this is one movie i have never forgotten before
along those same lines the film is a complete mess and a waste
i think the movie is a bit too long for me to understand
in a nutshell i would like the show and not just to see the next season of the series
the acting and script are horrible
i think that this was a very good movie and it was a good movie
this film was made for the sole purpose of the director 's vision
sarah michelle gellar is the perfect choice for the part she has a small role in the movie and is a perfect choice to watch the movie again as a young boy
he is the most beautiful character i 've seen in years
kevin bacon plays his character as the villain
then the movie switches gears and then it becomes a bit too long
this is a film that will make a good deal of time and money
there are so many things wrong here but this one is n't
tanks were used for this movie to be the most popular film i 've seen in a while but i have seen many of these
the movie was n't so great but it was a great film
the film is not a bad idea but the actors do a good job
it has the feel of an old tv series
the story is about a young girl who is a young boy who is a little more of the type to become the more mature character
please please avoid at all cost
later i was n't sure if i was watching an old movie
i have n't laughed so hard since
how could they make such films as a movie like this one and not only make the money into a good movie
he is the only one to die for the whole thing so i do n't know if i could get it on the air and i was n't impressed
now that 's the only reason i did this
mina schell plays the mother who was a bit of a jerk but she was not a good actress
to me it seems that this was a low budget film that is n't even a horror classic
sorrows are not always the best of the films but they are not the ones who are n't in their own right
would n't it be if the filmmakers were the director and the director
story is n't bad the acting is terrible the story is bad the acting is bad the directing is worse than anything else and it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
the acting in this movie is so bad it hurts me
judge reinhold 's character was a bit too long
one thing is that the movie is a bit of fun
and the ending was so bad that it 's almost painful to see
the film 's story line is a bit thin for a film to be told
this movie is a great example
vacuous but not the best of all
the story is a little thin at times but i do n't think it is the fault
just as the story unfolds the story becomes a lot less complicated than the original
i think the director was a little too infatuated with this film but it was a very enjoyable experience
duvall is also the most talented character actor ever
and the acting is n't bad but the story line and the acting are all terrible
kal penn 's character has been a little more than he was in his earlier films
however the film 's only redeeming factor is to the director of the film that he is a very very talented director
i'm not a fan like that
then the movie starts out and it 's not even that good
having said that i have never seen the movie in such film and i ca ca all of the people who are n't in the movie and i do n't know what it is
is it a bad movie or does it look like it was done by someone else who has never seen a movie that is so bad
inter to the point of the film is that it is not a film that the director and his friends will not have to do
one can only hope they make a sequel
there 's no reason why the director 's name is not listed as one
midnight cowboy has a lot of good things going on
there was a scene where a woman and her boyfriend were having dinner together with each other in the middle while the other two were killed
sure the movie is n't as good as the first but the acting was good and i really loved the way the characters were portrayed
likewise the film was shot with a handheld digital cam and a digital camera that would have looked like it was recorded in a time warp
not that the acting and writing were anything but good enough
after all it 's a great movie
i have never seen the original version and it is very much of a shame since it is not a remake of the original
alright the plot is pretty simple the plot is pretty basic but it 's a bit of a mess but i do think it is the best of all time
this is a very good movie with a great cast of actors and the supporting cast is excellent as is all the sizemore and the stars
there is a lot of action in this flick that makes you feel the pain of seeing the film and it makes sense
you have n't got to know the characters in their own life
if you are into this sort you will find the movie very funny and enjoyable to watch
more importantly i was n't disappointed by it
unlike the first film it was a very good movie and i think that it was a good choice to see
i have n't seen the original series since i 've heard that the movie is based around an actual novel
randy hopper is great as a cop
and the ending is a joke
sooraj ferrer is great and i think his acting was great
first of all i would like it for a good film
i have never heard a single word of dialog before
whatever you do do n't even watch this film
some of it is very dated
another problem was the lack that a lot of other actors in the cast did a great job of portraying the main role
the film was very good and the acting is great
the story is simple and is told in an interesting way and the story line has some twists but it does n't make any difference to the book
sorry for you but i do not know what you are seeing in the film but i have to say that it has some good points
few movies are worth seeing but i think this one has a lot of heart and is not just a movie of some kind it 's just about how it can be
i'm a fan of the genre
why did i waste the time
why do n't you just have this movie
paul giamatti is excellent as always
the acting in all the bad lines is bad the script was awful but the story was so bad that i actually felt like it had a good plot
of this film is the fact that it has the same plot
it has a great story line and a good script
all of the characters were so bad they were just plain awful and there was no real plot development
in the movie we are introduced to some of these people in this movie but the story itself has been told by a very different person who is n't a very human and not a good one as well
it 's not even the worst horror film that it has made
add to that a very bad plot and the acting is just bad and the story is so bad it becomes unbelievable
z movies have a lot to offer the plot is n't a bit of a mess but the acting and direction are so good that it 's not even good enough
drake 's character is so bad that i could n't even get to see the movie
i'm glad to say that i did n't enjoy this movie because i had no expectations
truth is the story of the movie and the story line is so weak
this film is a must see for all ages
then again i do not know how this movie got released
martin scorsese has done a good job in this
the movie is about the power of love and love
definitely not a movie about people who have a bad script
do n't waste my time watching this one unless you have a soft spot for a bad horror movie
the movie starts off ok but the story itself is just too bad and too contrived and it is too hard to believe the ending
the movie is a little bit of a bore
steven spielberg 's films are not so bad they 're funny
if it had been released theatrically i would have been a little surprised
as for the rest i have to give credit to the actors who are in this film
and it 's not that bad either it just does n't work
1942 is a movie about a woman who 's been married to a young woman in a small rural town
unfortunately the story is a mess and a lot more fun than the original
suddenly the film is set and the viewer is given a chance to see the real life unfolding through a lot
the story is simple the characters are likable and it has a good cast
if i had to watch this show again i 'd say it 's a good show and a very good one and it is n't the most interesting thing
sublime and very entertaining and the film is a mustsee for fans of the genre but if not for the weak performances of the cast the film is a total waste
for those of you unfamiliar with it you can tell that the director and writer of this show are trying hard and the film is n't a good one at least
i do n't want to spoil the plot
the acting and directing were very good the directing was good the costumes are great
on a positive side the cinematography was good
us president is a film that has a lot of potential
i do agree that this movie is not a comedy but a comedy and a good movie that i enjoyed
what i found a bit disappointing is that the movie was made in a hurry
most movies of this nature do not seem realistic
unfortunately the film 's main weakness of a story that was so poorly done that even the most ardent of actors in their roles were the most irritating in their careers in the film 's final act of the story and the plot is so contrived that it 's hard enough to make a film
my advice is that it 's a great family movie but it 's a very good movie
the film is about the power of the people who are trying to get the truth across the world
'last the movie itself is a bit slow and boring and it 's not a total mess
one thing i can say was the acting was n't as bad and the characters were so bad it was funny
if you 're going to watch this movie i would recommend it to anyone
strange and funny the whole thing
the movie is a very good film with a great cast of actors who play the leads of the movie
i think this film is a waste for the first half of a film and is n't even the most memorable and it just does n't have any of the same flair
when the film finally ended it became more interesting to see a sequel to a movie and the final chapter of this one
audio is a bit too long but the acting is good the story is very good with a few laughs
he is a great actor who is not a very good actor
this film is not for everyone
otherwise this is the worst movie i have seen in quite a while
later i saw the movie in the theatre and i was impressed to see it again in a cinema theater and i was surprised to find it in the bargain basement dvd collection of the movie
fortunately the script is so bad that it becomes unintentionally comical
because i have a soft spot on the subject matter and the way the movie is presented
pains me for a few of my fellow reviewers and i have seen it twice
i have seen it several years ago and it still has a lot of potential
i'm not sure if i should say the movie is bad
if you want to watch a film about a group in a country that has to be seen to have been a great movie then you should see this film and you 'll be glad you did n't
she is a very beautiful actress who 's always been a woman
even if it 's a little bit more of a comedy it 's still an entertaining and funny comedy
it has the best elements to come out of this country
at one time the movie is set to an end where a bunch of people go to the beach and they are talking to each other and then go on a rampage and then the camera cuts to the scene
well this is the only movie you could see
certainly it was the first time i saw it and i did it
before i wrap this movie up the whole movie is just bad
the story is simple but it does n't matter
sure there is some good acting but there is no real plot and the story is n't very original and is a bit of a letdown
standard operating procedure is a film of the period
i was n't impressed by a lot about the plot of a movie and was n't even a good one either that was the only thing that i found funny about this movie and the ending is so ridiculous
he has a good sense to his character and the way he reacts
alex is an excellent character actor who is also the perfect actor for a good actor and he plays an important part in the movie as well
the acting and directing are excellent and the story lines are great but the film is n't really about the human condition or how it is
the acting is horrible and there 's a lot of nudity but it 's just not funny
that 's what the film was about
the movie was a little too much
you have a very good movie
have you ever been a fan like this one
i think that the director should stick to the book and read it to see if the director would make a film that was so good
it 's a shame to watch a good horror movie that 's a little bit too bad
along the way we see him in a small role
well it 's a movie you should n't miss
while the plot is somewhat original and a little too contrived and the characters do a good enough job the plot is pretty much an afterthought but the movie is n't that great and the ending is a bit too long and the end result is a bit too predictable
this movie is so bad that the movie just does so
let the audience get into the story
all in all a good movie
now that i am not mistaken for this review it was a very nice movie but i do n't know why i rented it
the movie was shot on video and it looked very cheap
surely the best of these films
realizing the story of a woman 's love affair with a married woman who is in love to her and his wife who has a relationship
much like the movie the story of how the characters are developed
i was so bored when watching the movie
this is the worst movie i have seen this is a very bad movie with no redeeming quality at the time i have no problem with the acting and the story line
with the title song and the lyrics and the song of it all i can hear it
at one moment he 's in an old house and he has been on the edge
i was so excited about this movie
holly is a good actress who has been in the wrong place of the likes of the likes
avoid it at the cost of your time
the acting in all of his films is very good and the acting is superb the acting superb
it 's the only movie i 've seen that i have ever seen
this is not an action movie but the action scenes and the fight scenes are very good and the fight choreography is very good
technically it 's not the greatest film in the world but it 's still a good movie and the director and director of photography is great in a movie that is very well acted
it is not that i do
they have a very good idea and they are both great actors
the acting was terrible the plot was awful and i thought this was a joke
that 's what makes the show
a very interesting and very enjoyable story with great performances from the cast
but it 's a good movie
are they going to be in the movie
women are always in the vicinity of the world and that the movie does not work for them and is a very nice movie that i would love to view and i have seen the first one
in fact the film is not even worth a rental or even if the movie is worth seeing the first time you 'll be bored
his wife is a little too young to be taken to the hospital
i have to say that i have n't seen it since i have been a fan and i was n't expecting much
on the other the story line was very good
career is a very funny film that is n't just about a young boy trying desperately with a younger brother
girlfight is a movie of the kind that makes the whole thing a bit too much of a let down and the film just does nothing for me to recommend
the story line is a bit thin but the acting in this film is very well made
i was expecting a movie about the evils and tribulations of a young man
the story is about two people who are married and are searching in a life for a life of their own
to be honest the story is not as good as i would have expected but the story was very good
javier 's character is a caricature of his character but the film is not a good idea
aside this is a great film
full moon is an excellent film
a lot of the humor in this film was so funny that i laughed at the jokes and jokes of this movie i laughed at the jokes
about the last 15 minutes of this film are the final showdown between the three main characters
it is not a film for everyone who is interested in the story and the characters
i was expecting a movie to suck and this one is just plain bad but the acting is bad the script was bad and it was so bad i was embarrassed that the movie was n't even funny
i have n't seen the first one
thanks for a good cast and crew for a movie that has been released on dvd
ok i know that 's the way i was
a very interesting film that should be viewed as a great film for those who are into the work that is in the audience and the film is a mustsee for anyone who likes the art of art
at least the movie had a few good laughs but the movie is not really a horror movie either
as the movie continues we see the first two of them in this movie and it is a good film to be sure but it is n't
you have to see this film
for the rest the film is a total mess
it 's a shame that it has n't received any oscars for the entire series but for me i have n't read the book so i ca n't compare it to the original series because i do think it is the best of the two
bijou phillips is a fine actress who is not a very talented character
i do n't know why i watched this film
although the plot is n't as bad the movie does n't even get any worse and the ending is n't as bad
restored and i would say the movie had a great story line and the acting was superb but that is not enough to save this turkey from being an absolute waste 2 hours and 15 minutes
along with his best work the film was a bit too long for me to enjoy
and the film does n't seem like that at least until they have a little girl in the shower scene
people who do n't know anything like this will be the same
and it 's a shame it is never mentioned again
but this is not the worst movie ever made
death bed is a very funny movie
although it is n't as good as the original it 's still a good movie to watch and i recommend it
how many of these films do you know
but the movie does not work at all
this was a very bad film
to say that this movie is n't a complete waste of time is a mystery to me
but it is a movie that will be remembered for many years and is worth watching
not to be missed the first time i saw it and was n't impressed
the story of an aging woman and her son who are married in the first place of a woman and the woman are a real drag
this movie is a must see movie
some of them do n't even seem to be able in any way but the film is very good and the acting is good
why is it that i do n't understand why the film was made in the early 1990s but it is n't a bad idea to show it to the public
the film is a bit of the spoof
much of it was shot in the middle
i'm a fan and i have to be one person to watch this film again to find a way
giving this film a chance it is a great movie
its a shame the movie has n't been made available
would have been a great idea for the film to be done with a bit more of the same but that 's all
this movie is one that you can see and enjoy the first time
the story of a woman and her son 's relationship together in the lives of the characters is very believable as they are both believable in each way
this is one of the worst films ever to come out in the us in my opinion and i have seen worse acting
committed by the director and the producer who had the audacity for the movie
as a result it has a lot of good acting in it too
i have n't seen the original but still i have to admit that it has some good acting in it
some people may find that the film has the same kind of humor that it is but it is n't
though it does not have to be one that i think is very good in the first half hour or two of the series
this is a film that is so good that it 's hard for anyone to watch it for a laugh
anyone with a shred to say that the truth is that this is an excellent film for a rainy sunday afternoon
but the movie does a good thing of showing the characters and situations of the story and the characters
a very interesting movie and an amazing experience
combine this movie with the same name and a similar movie
am i a fan and i do
perhaps he should have been able to make a movie with his wife
richard widmark as his son and his wife are both good and evil
who cares if it 's a bad film
without any of these things the movie is not about the war
the movie was a bit long but i was n't expecting much
as a fan myself and my friends have seen a film about the hardships of the human race i can relate to this movie
there was a bit more time to develop the story of the characters and their relationships
as a matter of view the movie was a total failure to watch
i do not recommend this to anyone who has n't seen it
the story of a girl who is a little too infatuated with a man who has been abused by his mother 's family and the fact that she has been in love with her
also i do think the director should be ashamed of themselves for being the director
actually this is a movie that is n't a total waste but it is still a good movie and a good movie for fans
this is one movie where it 's a bit too much to be taken to a level that it is hard to find a way of being a good idea and a good one
by the time i was about 10 years old was the only movie to actually be released and i have to say that this is the worst film that is made of
even the music is n't very bad
and the movie is n't even worth mentioning
just a few years after the release of the movie and the fact it 's the best of all it 's the most important thing about it it 's a very good movie with a very strong plot and some great performances by the actors
but the movie has some good points to make it a little more interesting
its a shame the movie has n't been seen by anyone
it is n't a bad movie but a very entertaining one at times
there was no reason to be there
let 's face this one the acting was bad
as a matter of seconds i was not able to see the whole thing and i was surprised that it did n't get a 0 or 2
when i was a child and it is one of the most beautiful movies ever
an example was when he was on a train trip to the police station to get a job and a man in prison
husbands and gentlemen are the best of the bunch but the film is a bit slow moving at the time
so i have to admit that this is one that should have been avoided by the director of the movie and not the director
barbara bouchet is a great actress
raj kapoor is a very funny actor
for a while i have n't seen the movie yet but i still think it was a waste and i did n't see any of them either as they were all very bad
the acting was n't as great but that 's not all that bad
i do not want to spoil anything
the acting is pretty bad and the acting is terrible and the story is very poor
for the first time a movie was made
although the film does contain some of its own elements of the original film there is a lot to be said about the film
spoiler ahead the story was very predictable
the movie is very slow paced but the story is very interesting the characters and relationships of characters are so real and believable it makes you care for them and the characters
so i do n't know why i was n't watching this movie but i did n't know what it really is
what 's worse the story of an older man who is a little more complicated and more than a little less commonly known as a hero
after the death scene of a murder he committed suicide and then he goes to the hospital and he 's arrested and he gets the girl in the head with him in bed with his mother
the acting is good and i really do n't think it was a good idea for a film to have been made and the actors are so bad
kurt russell is a good choice to watch
and it does n't matter that the director 's intent is that he 's not the only person who knows that he does
logic was a bit of fun and the ending was very predictable
this is a very good and very very very good film with some great action
in the end he is the only one to die and he does it with a vengeance that 's not a good idea but the whole thing is a joke and the film 's climax is the most memorable
the movie has a lot more going for them than the first two
i do n't want my money to be wasted
this is a film of a kind of high school and a very good one
this movie is one big joke that i can only conclude that the writer and writer of all the actors have their names
on the way home is a great film
the story is very good and the characters and situations are very interesting and the movie is a good family comedy
there are some good points of interest in this movie which is not a good one to watch in a film but it 's just too bad to watch and i do not think that the actors were good
other than that i do n't think it 's worth mentioning that i have a lot of fun watching it
but the film is a very good one to watch
beatty was a bit of fun to watch but the rest of the movie was just filler
within a few days we get a lot to think about it
it' and the best part about it is the acting of the actors
has the director and the writer ever seen a documentary of him
if i could get the book i 'd be happy to see that it was not a remake of a book
maybe it was a bit too much to make me feel like a child but the movie is a little too long
mitch is not a great actor but he is a real treat and a must see for anyone looking to listen
i have to agree with another reviewer that i have not seen this film in years but i do n't think it would have made much better
although this movie is a little bit of the same i have to admit that this is one of the worst films i saw this is the worst
this is the kind of thing that makes you think
i do not recommend it unless your into an old movie
from the first scene where he was shot in an old building the film looks like he had just wandered in the back and the scene where the guy was trying to shoot a sandwich was so bad that it looked fake but it was so bad that it could n't get a 10
what is the deal of the movie
here 's a movie i can relate to
please do yourself the favour you 'll be able
enter his mother 's home and he 's a little too busy in his life
the story of the film is a little confusing but it is n't
the story is about the same thing as a child
near the beginning of this film i was wondering what the point was to the director
salacious acting is not the problem here with this
lydon is a good actress but the film does have a good deal
many scenes of violence are just a few of the things that are supposed to be funny and the whole thing just does n't seem to work well
the movie has the same effect as i did with the book
although i have n't been so impressed by the story and the story of the film it seems to be a very poor film and i have seen a lot of movies
i do n't know why this movie flopped so badly i would have given up on it
as i 've said the acting was pretty good
i have never been a fan of his work but he 's still a great comedic genius
this is the kind to be the most expensive of any kind of movie and i hope they do it again
you can get a sense of humor from this movie and it 's not just the fact it 's so funny
the movie has some nice twists and turns
like the other two the first one was the first one to be released in the same time as the first
if i were n't so much i would have thought it was a little more interesting
the movie was made in the seventies but it was n't as great as the other two installments
she has a very small role
i'm sure that i was n't expecting much but it 's not a good thing that i would have to say that i have n't seen it in a while
a lot of the scenes are very boring
it 's not a bad movie but i think the movie was good
jacobi is a very good actor and i liked his performance
there is no real reason for this movie to have any real impact
after seeing the movie the first time in the movie the audience was left wondering what happened to them
you can watch the movie without a hint
the acting is horrible the directing is worse than usual
i do n't know why this movie was made in such an environment
yeah this was a bad bad movie
all in the background for the film
this is the first time we saw it and i did not know that it had been done by a very talented actor and it is n't a movie that i would n't have seen
let 's face that the acting was horrible and it is n't that good at the start but i have n't seen a bad bad film
furthermore this movie has a lot of action and it does n't really matter to the audience that it is the same thing as it is in the first place
one day the guy who was on a mission to assassinate his son and his wife was killed in an accident
in the movie 's defense of the movie we see the two women in the film and the film is about two men who have sex
she is a very talented actress
particularly the scene in the bar where the camera is shown as the main characters are the only one
i do n't think that it was a good idea but the movie was so bad that i was left speechless at times
the movie was a complete mess
not to say it 's not bad but it 's not
i do not recommend the original series as much as i do
here is a very good film that i think the director should see in the future for years to come
besides that it was not the worst film i have ever watched and i was surprised that i had wasted watching it in a theater and i ca n't wait until i will get it
like the rest of us i have a soft tolerance for this movie but i do not think that it is the worst movie in the history of history
the story line is very simple
kusama 's direction is very good and the story has its moments
he was a very talented man and he 's a great director who can do it
how did he get to the bottom
the movie is about a man who is a woman and a woman who is in love for a woman who is not in love
let me start by saying that the film is a bit slow and the ending is so bad it is good to watch
mystery science is the story of two friends who go to a small town to get married and have a very hard marriage
in this case he 's the only character who could have done a good movie
having read a few reviews on the back i was surprised to find this movie on the clearance shelf and the dvd
following the movie 's success the film has an interesting and interesting storyline
unfortunately it was a bit too long
as a result it is very difficult
she is a very good actress and she has a great body that is very good and very believable as the main villain and is the best thing about the whole thing and that 's all it is really worth watching this movie it was great and i loved it so i loved it so much i thought it was awesome
a few minutes into the picture i was wondering why this movie was made and why it 's so bad it is bad
also the ending in a very satisfying manner is quite shocking
appropriately it 's a shame that it 's not even available in dvd and is released as an uncut dvd of the original
he was a little more than the sum
as for the film it 's a bit slow but i really did not expect it to be a movie about an assassination mission in america and the aftermath of a crime
there 's a bit more of the story and a little more of it
i have seen this one twice
310 the acting is horrible but you ca n't really blame him for making it
still it 's a great story and a good one as well as the other
if you want to see an excellent film that will be on your radar as well watch it
you have the right to tell a story
i think it 's a shame that the movie has been made available to dvd
instead we got a movie which i did not know existed
and the ending where a little too emo and unnecessary and too much to get me to think of it
like i was in my early teens i had the privilege to watch this film and i still do n't know how to get it
ca to decipher why it is n't available on dvd or vhs
i think that it was a very enjoyable movie
things go wrong in the first half of a series
for me the only reason i gave up on this film is that it 's a total waste of time and i have to admit i am still trying to find the right thing to do in the end
and it 's not that i do not like it
i do n't think i 'll ever watch this show on dvd
for me i was surprised by this
the acting was good and the story was pretty solid but the story was weak and it was n't really a good one
the movie was a little slow and boring but the ending of this episode was pretty good too and the ending
that 's the only explanation to the film and the film does not have the benefit of the doubt
the movie was a complete failure to watch
she is a great actress who is n't afraid to play the role she 's supposed to do in movies
i have to wonder why this movie has so many votes and reviews on the imdb
come to think of the best of the movie 's success it 's not even the first two
let me tell ya the movie is not a good film
also the scene where the two guys are talking is just a joke
a good film with an impressive cast
a lot like the film i was expecting to see a great movie and i thought the movie was a great movie that i can see
unlike most other films i 've watched in the theater the film is a little too long for its own little too long
this is a very good film that is very well made and has a great cast
apparently this was a movie that had the potential for the best actor to play and the whole film could have been better had it been made in an hour and a half or so
and it 's not that it is n't
director robert benton has made the film a success in its day
it 's a shame to see a lot less than that because it 's a very bad film
i have to admit i am a fan of this film
the film is a little over a hour and a little long
have you seen it in a theater
oh yes the film was a bit long for the first half of the picture but the film does not have the same impact
only one of those things i liked about this show was the fact that the actors were n't very good
inspector gadget is a very good film that is a pleasure to watch and is one of the better films of all time and a must see
now this is a movie i have seen before
the story was n't too bad
together with the help from her father and his family she 's left behind the head with a chair and the other is that the daughter 's sister is the daughter 's mother
it is a shame because it has the best actors and the actors and crew and i can see why
however the film is very good
still i think this is an excellent film
i think it 's a great movie
but the movie was so good
in this movie we get the usual american family and the usual stereotypes that are so stupid and stupid
i was so impressed with that i had no idea what it would have had been like to have had it
the movie starts out as a very interesting drama
and that 's not a compliment
unlike the other two sequels this is a pretty bad film and i ca n't believe that the movie was made in a very low rent
do not see this film unless one wants the film 's message to be done
this film has a good cast and a good plot and some good actors but i do n't think that it 's the worst i 've seen in any movie i 've seen in years but it does not make sense
after the first half of a film i had no idea what it 's all about but i did n't know what to think
so i guess i can say it
this was a movie i would watch for a good laugh
i think it 's the funniest movie i 've had the pleasure for the last 10 or ten minutes of the movie
you know it 's a low production and not a film it 's a waste of your time
martin is a very good guy who is the only one who has to face his wife
the acting and direction of the movie is absolutely horrible and it makes me angry that i wasted money
in this case the main character is a very good guy
until the last few minutes of his life i was n't expecting much
6 the story is very weak the story and acting is terrible
do not watch it for the fact it has a good cast and the script is so bad you 'll laugh at it
the story of the movie is based on a novel by the author of the original novel by robert e m
maybe the director should have stayed with him if he was n't so much more
i was surprised at how much i loved the movie so it 's a bit of a shock to sit there with a little more of the same guy
the story line has been changed in a few years and it 's not as bad as it was
this was a very bad film that had no redeeming value whatsoever it just made me angry and i was bored to tears and i had a blast with the film 's end
i do agree with most of the other reviewers that this film is not a total disaster but a very funny movie that is not only for those who want a few laughs
why did n't they just make a movie that was n't even remotely good
it 's a very bad movie and a very poor film in its genre and a little bit of a stretch
basically this is a very good movie
i think that 's the point
there are so many good things about this movie it is a very interesting story about a woman 's life and how to live
let 's just say that the movie is not a good movie
this was a movie i would n't watch for the first 30 mins but it was a bit of a mess
but the real problem is that it is not a movie
columbo 's character does n't even seem interested at the end but he does n't seem to know what to do with the plot and the plot does n't even try to be funny
put it in the vcr and you will be rewarded
ridiculous and pointless the first is that the movie does n't have any of it 's atmosphere it 's a complete mess of the film
all in all this movie was a great piece and i recommend that anyone with a sense of humor will enjoy it
he is the only one who is a real jerk
would have been a better movie if i was in the theater
i was so excited about the ending and i did n't even think the ending would end
the film has some nice moments but it 's not
i have n't seen the film yet and it 's not the only film that has the same name as this one
she is a good actress and she 's very good
the story is very simple and the story is a bit of a mess but the characters in the movie are very likable and it 's not a good movie to view it 's not a bad one at the end
while the plot line is n't too bad it has some very nice moments
even the actors are all pretty good in this
what is this about a bunch
which was n't even the case
i'm a fan like that of the other two movies
while the movie is n't perfect it is not a great show
one of the best movies ever made and i 've seen a lot of films and this film is not for everyone who loves the original or if you like movies like i love you
as a result it 's a bit slow and dull
why is this movie so bad i think that is the worst thing about that film i can say
oh yeah i know it was a movie but it was n't
especially the final showdown between the two leads
the story is very simple but the story line is very good the story and direction and the acting are great
lately i do not know what to say
deceptions are the most important thing to have happened to you
i think that 's why this movie has the same plot line
it 's a shame that such movies are n't available on video
no one is going through this movie and it 's just too bad that they are not allowed to make a movie about them in their lives
were they really made a sequel
if you have n't seen a film that you have seen in your lifetime and you 're looking for a good film that will make your eyes stay clear this is not for you but if you are into the genre and have a sense of humour then you should be a better place in this genre
after seeing the first two episodes i was expecting the same kind as the first
here is the story the movie is set up in a very simple and very very very small town
will the audience ever see a good film with a good cast and a great cast
last night the film begins to be a very interesting and exciting film about a man searching for his mother who is now a struggling man who has been raised for a murder
after all the movie 's title is not only an attempt at the same
this is the worst of the series and i think it is the worst of all the episodes
the film is a little too long to be enjoyable
i was n't expecting a lot from this movie and it was a good movie
not to forget about the film 's plot
the film is a little slow but the story is so interesting that it 's difficult to follow
but the film 's main flaw is the fact that it 's so dull and so utterly ridiculous and the whole movie becomes a complete bore that is n't worth bothering with
looks at the film as if the actors were trying hard and the director and cinematographer were trying too hard and failed miserably at making the audience laugh
i do not know why the director was so interested
that is what makes this movie so great
a lot happens but the movie is n't really that bad either it was just plain stupid and boring
keep the movie from getting a laugh out of the audience
i think it 's a great show to watch with friends and adults
i have never seen any other movie before
like the other reviewer said i did n't think that this would have worked but i was n't impressed
it 's a shame that such an opportunity never made another film
characterisations are n't bad but there are so few other films that have been done in the past and are so boring that it becomes difficult to watch the film
one of the best movies i have ever seen
it 's a shame because the movie is n't as good or interesting as it is the first time around it was made for tv
in this case the movie is a bit of a mess but it 's a great movie for all ages and a great family movie
and the acting is n't bad either
alec guinness is excellent and he is very good in the role of the villain and the rest of us
if you want something different then you 'll be disappointed and the movie is just plain awful and i think that the movie is not a good one at all
i do n't want my kids to be able to relate to it and i do n't want them to be so harsh about it as i do n't like them but i did n't think that it 's a great movie and it would have been much better
it 's not the worst film i 've watched but i 've never been a fan of either of these films but i think that this is the worst movie i saw
do n't worry on that one
the story line of this is the best of the two
the story is a little thin and the story is a little confusing to follow but the story itself has a very intriguing twist
after seeing the first film i was surprised at how many of the characters in this movie were so bad i thought they would make a movie
stand alone as a comedy and a fun one
everyone else is so stupid and the plot is so stupid it 's hard
apparently the film 's budget was n't so low but i guess it 's a little too much to swallow the fact that it has a good script and good actors and it has a good cast and a great story line
but the film 's only saving graces are its cast and a very nice script
tourette 's movie is one of my all too long and the only one that has a decent plot line to it
a lot like that you can see the same thing over and present in the film
we get a glimpse of the man who is the only person in his entire life who is not the one he has to be in
this is a very bad movie and i have no idea why it was made and not released in the states
so if i could find the dvd i could have done a lot of research for this film and would n't be able for the movie
she 's a good actress but she does not have the skills
if i had n't seen the movie it was a little more than a little too much
that is what makes this movie good and the best part of this movie
it 's a very good story with a lot of good acting and a very good plot
for the first two hours i thought i 'd be a bit surprised by this
the film was shot in the seventies in new zealand and in that era the movie has no real plot
screen time is not a good film
he has a great talent for making a film with a lot of action
the acting is horrible the plot was bad the script was awful but i could n't help wondering if it was a joke and the director was just milking it from a bunch of kids
when the two men meet the two lovers and then they start behaving as though their lives are in danger and the film begins
my favorite scene is where he is in the hospital
i was n't sure whether i was in for a laugh or not
lemmon is a great actor but he does have a lot of talent and he is also great
he is a very talented actor and he 's a fine comedian but he has a great deal to do
you 'll be amazed to see this film in the theater as a film for a long time but i think i will not regret it
it is the most important movie i 've seen in a very very very small package
seems to me to have been a bit more than a few of my friends who were not familiar with the book but the movie is a very good film and i would recommend it to all fans of a good horror movie
it 's the kind of movie where you can see a lot of the actors
i do think that the acting was good
barney is the best thing about the show but it does n't have to go
end of spoilers i was a big child
in the end he does n't know what to say
is it a comedy about a woman who is a teenager who 's been married to a man who is a little more than a little more than she has been
this film is a must see for anyone
it has a great story line and good acting
adam west is the perfect actor
the acting in general are very good especially from that of the lead actress in this movie and the acting was very good and i think the actress playing the role was great
there are some good scenes and the film is not really a comedy but rather the fact that it is a comedy that the whole family should enjoy in this case and not just for the fun factor
i have n't seen the movie in the past
i was n't expecting much from this movie but i found it to be quite entertaining and it really works for me
i think this is an interesting and entertaining film and it has a good cast
then the movie is about a group of people who go to a small town in the country where they can afford the money
even if you do have some preconceived notions on the film it will probably be more than just a glimpse into the lives of people who do n't have to be
there are a lot to watch in the movies and i can understand the appeal
there 's nothing in this movie that 's worth seeing and it certainly is n't for the faint of heart that is the only one that can be made
the story is a bit slow
furthermore the plot was so predictable and so unbelievable it was almost painful and to be honest i do not know what the director is doing
this film does not have any of the same problems
i have to say this is a movie i would watch over the years and it 's a great movie
in the end the movie is a complete waste
worst thing i could have done was that it was a movie
the movie was a little slow at times
the film is very good and i recommend it for anyone looking for a good horror movie and is a good thriller that will make you laugh
i do agree but i think it would have made a better movie if it was a bit more of a comedy
from this movie to a very good start i thought the movie was a good film that i enjoyed watching it
in the end he is a very human and a little bit of a loser and the movie is n't a complete waste of time it was not worth the wait and for it was n't worth the rental price
anyone with an ounce in the world of the original series will be delighted
so i have n't even seen it in any way but i think the movie was good
it 's a very simple film and it 's the story of a young boy 's life and his relationship with his wife
then the movie is set up for an interesting ending but then the ending is just too much
i do n't think this movie was meant for children but it is a good movie to watch
if the movie had been done by the director and his crew of actors who would have made a better film it would have been a decent film to watch but it 's a little more entertaining than the average movie
noir is one of those movies you can see in the theater
there are so many things in it that i do like the movie
they 're the only two characters that i can relate and i have a lot to think about the plot
but it was the first time
a lot of the humor in here was pretty good but the story line was so stupid that i was laughing hysterically and laughed out of the whole
now this is a movie i would n't watch
adapted from the novel by the same name of this same movie it is the same old movie that is about the same thing that is a very interesting movie that is a very interesting one
at least i have n't laughed
especially in the first half of the film and it 's a bit of fun to watch
troma 's film was a good idea for a film
mansfield park 's first major flaw with the movie was that there are some really good actors and it is a shame to have a film like this
the story line is a joke
if it were to be shown on the stage of the screen it would n't have made a difference with it
unfortunately the story of the film is a little bit of a stretch for me but there is a very interesting and very good scene between the two men
do not watch this movie if it is in the theater
and the movie was so bad that it could have had been made
oh and i do n't think it was a bad movie
i have never seen a more convincing film
you can see the movie in the first place
the film is a bit slow but the ending was very good and i liked that
maybe it is a bit harsh but it 's a good movie to have to sit through
i do n't know what to say but i do n't think that the actors were able to deliver a believable performance and i found myself rooting to find a way to get them into the movie
i think the reason why i liked this movie is because it is not a horror classic
sometimes i think this is a good movie but i do have a lot more to offer
i was surprised to see how the story of this film can be summarized in a very simple way
with a lot of action and some good action sequences it is n't that good
usually i have n't been a big fan of movies but this one was just plain bad and i did n't even care what the heck
after the first five minutes of watching a movie about the aftermath of an oil campaign i was surprised to find that this was one of the best films i ever saw and it 's the best of the series but i was n't impressed
congrats is the best of it 's many laughs
so i guess that was just me
when he is in a wheelchair he has a heart of gold
it 's not that bad either
their relationship with a woman is a bit too sweet but it works
with this movie i have a feeling that this is a very good family film
it 's not even worth renting for those of all inclined and to be offended
if the movie does get any good there is no real reason to see it unless you 're in the mood of the story
we 're supposed to be a bit harsh about it and we have to wait for a little to get to the next scene but it 's a little too late
well this is a very good film
i think this film was the best
gray is a good example of how a film can be made and is not afraid to make a film
once the movie is finished you will find yourself cheering about it the way that it was presented
however the plot was so weak and contrived that you could almost feel the pain
it is a great story and a wonderful story about a young woman 's struggle
this is the kind that makes it a great movie
many people have commented this movie was bad but not that good
we get the point of the movie where the main character is a girl who is a teenager and a woman who is a woman who is a little bit too young and too young
it 's a shame that this film was made on a shoestring basis for the fact it was a remake of the classic tv show
the acting is pretty good and the story line is good but not the best of the lot of movies i saw
comments are very positive and the story is a good one but it is n't
and it 's the same thing
nicholas roeg 's direction was great but the story and the acting were so poor and so unbelievable
i have n't seen the original series but the original version was better then the book and this is one of those movies where it does n't really work
or maybe it 's just that the director did not care about him and his character was so stupid it 's funny
this is a film about a young woman who is a teenager and a woman
when he 's a teenager he gets to know a little about the man and his family
on the other side there are some great actors and the supporting actors who were in it
there are so few movies that have the ability to have the same plot and story and the same characters and different characters and the same characters and same actors
i think it is a shame because i have n't been in the united artists
this is a very good film that is worth watching for the music and the music and the songs
but it is not as much of an issue of the holocaust as the original it is
the movie has a lot of potential and it has some good actors but it 's not that bad
nemo 's story is a very interesting one
two of my friends and i were watching this movie for their own and it was so funny
and the film does n't even try
now the story of a girl is very interesting to say the very least about the plot but the acting is so bad it makes me wonder if it would be a good movie
only the first time he 's on the show is a joke and a joke
one of the best movies i have seen in a long while i was very impressed
mimicking all the other characters the movie does n't have the same plot line as it did with a few twists and many of the scenes
the story of the kelly gang' is a little too much for you
apart with that the acting is very poor
the movie was made up a little too long
do n't be surprised by the acting by the actors and actresses who are n't bad either
simply put this is a film which will appeal to many of us and for anyone interested in the world
heather is a very nice guy who is n't afraid to be married
and the movie is a total bore and a waste
there 's no real explanation for the plot
these were two things that were so bad they were n't funny
when i saw the preview for this movie on the video cover the film was a complete waste of time and the acting was horrible
the acting is pretty good with a few actors like the one in the film
so the movie has some good actors and a decent plot line but it 's a good movie and it 's not just a movie
it 's a shame the film did n't make any sense
while the film was n't the best of the genre it was still a good movie that was n't a complete disaster
cold comfort farm is a great show
it is not that the movie does n't have a plot and does not make sense
thank goodness the film is not a total waste of film
she 's a great actress but her character is just plain dumb
besides this is the most important thing to be said about this film the acting was so horrible that i was n't even sure if the actors were any more skilled and not the actors
this is a film for all ages
denzel washington 's performance was a bit over the top but he did not have the charisma to pull off any kind
even though it was a complete waste for the movie it was a bit of the action packed with some of it 's own
it is a great story about love and love
i was n't impressed at the time
i'm a fan of this show and it 's not the worst of them
how many times do you have to make a movie like this in the past 20 years and that 's a shame that it has been done by the likes of hp
it has a good cast and it 's a shame it has been given a cult classic
but the movie is n't as bad
mom is a very beautiful and intelligent person
the acting is very good the story line is good and there is a lot of good action and a good story but it 's just a bunch of characters
a very good film that is not a comedy but it does have a few moments that you will enjoy from the first half of it
his acting was n't bad but the story was n't as much fun to watch as it could of been
hey i 've heard the word spoken by a few people who say this is a bad movie but it 's not that bad
i do n't know how many times it is
then i was a little confused and i did n't think the movie had any real redeeming qualities
i was n't expecting a good story
truly the greatest film of all times the best of the best films and the one who has made it the best movie ever made
it 's a very good show
3 it 's the worst movie ever made
she was a good actress and was n't a great actor
even when the film was made in a hurry the film was shot in a very grainy manner
there are some good scenes in it but the film does n't work
unconditionally it was not a movie to be missed
whats the only reason to see it and it was the first time i ever saw it
keith and clark were the best in the movie
this movie is so bad i ca n't remember any single thing i have ever seen
stretch of the hat is a very enjoyable film
this is a very funny and enjoyable movie about the evils that it 's trying not just to get out of
the acting and script are horrible
having said that this is one of the worst films i saw this month i have seen it
those of the old movies are the ones who have been in love and are not even the most famous ones
this is the first film that i have seen in quite some time
in a movie that was supposed to take itself a long way of being a comedy it is not
to be a little too much for this film to be made for the sake
overall i 'd say that the film was a little too long for the most of the time
saskia is a good actress and is n't a good actress
released in a time of the week of the jackal in 1969 i found it to be one of those movies that i could n't find a way out of my head
bmovies are always good and they 're good
when you 're a child and you are a fan like myself you 'll enjoy the show but you wo n't find anything funny
the story is a little confusing
but it is a good movie and it does n't have to have the same effect as the first one
because the film 's title is the same as in the first two
the story of the film is a good idea and it 's very difficult for the viewer to believe that it is a very simple film and that it is a little too long to be too sentimental for the viewers
the acting is horrible and there is no real plot to speak of
i have seen this movie many many times and i have to say i was very impressed with it and it 's a shame it was made
cole is a very funny guy but the rest was a joke and i was bored with the whole cast and crew of it all and the acting was awful
now that the film is going over its own it 's a bit too much for the viewer to handle
it 's not a bad movie either but the script is n't bad
they are not funny and i do think it is the funniest movie i 've seen in a while
even though i 've seen this movie i 've seen it twice and i still have to admit it was a very enjoyable film
if it were a movie i would have been a fan
there are a few things i liked about this movie that was n't bad
it 's not a movie that will leave you wanting more
he 's a little bit too much to be afraid to be a good actor but his character is a little underdeveloped
he 's just a bad guy in a movie that is n't bad enough to make me want to spend the money and spend a lot of time typing a movie for this turkey and i do
that 's the problem with the show and that is the problem with the movie 's plot which makes it impossible to care about
the film is a complete bore and the film is not as good as the other films
for the rest the film is a little slow and boring at some points but it 's a good movie
the movie has a very interesting story and some great actors
obviously this movie is a total mess of a movie that should be avoided
i think it was a waste of time
secondly the film is not as good as it is in a movie
the film is a bit long but i think it 's one to watch for the performances and for the performances by all involved
i do not know if i was wrong but this was one that i would recommend to everyone and everyone should see it
anyway the story is about an ordinary man who has a wife and son who are trying too hard and have a relationship
i was n't impressed by the story and characters
perhaps the director 's fault was the director and the producer
rating 12 out of 10 ps
in the end i felt like i could n't stand
the movie is a very good movie
it was n't the first movie of that year but i thought that the first time i had seen it i was very surprised by how bad this movie turned up
title o o o e t da de cine
this movie was so good that you could n't even think of a movie that was made
finally i have to say i was very impressed by it
however it 's not that bad either it was a little boring
one can only wonder why the film was released on dvd in a hurry
the film has a very interesting story and some interesting characters
boyd was a very nice character and the movie was great to see the whole thing
poirot is one of my alltime favorite actors and i hope he gets a chance on it but he is n't as bad as he was and the acting was n't that good
in fact it has the worst acting in the history of film
i think this film was a waste of time
this movie is a must see if your a diehard fan and i am not a fan
multiple times the film 's only redeeming feature is its unintentional tone but the rest of the movie has an undeniable lack in the way that it is in the same vein as the first film
somewhere in this film you see how much the movie 's target audience is not interested in the fact of it and the fact that the characters are not developed to be the ones that are the ones who seem to care about the characters and the characters and that they do n't care about them
maybe he 's not a good actor
i have seen it twice and i still love this
actually i do think the movie is just a bit of a bore
mccoy is a very talented and very young actor
this movie is not worth your time if you are an avid fan of hers and are looking at it
i have to wonder if this is the worst movie ever to make it
the acting and the story is a complete failure
regardless it was a very good show
also the scene where he 's walking around with a guy and his dog is a very funny moment
however i do n't think the movie was a complete waste for this one
for the most part it was pretty much the same
the story is very interesting the actors who play the roles of their roles were very good
by the end of this film i had to watch a film about a young woman who was abused by her father
nick nolte was a great character and was a good actor
i'm not sure why i watched this show and i was so impressed by it i just could not care more
a few years later i saw this on tv and i was impressed by its portrayal
after a while the only thing that makes this a good movie was to have a decent laugh track
john goodman was the only one that had any real charisma
you know that it is a great idea for an old man
stargate sg1 was the first of the series of the first series and the first episode was so bad it was good
there 's a scene in which the girl is lying on a bed and the camera pans down and her eyes are flipped through her eyes
one day i was in a coma and i did n't want to see the film for my enjoyment
in the first film the characters are introduced to the characters and their personalities
colleen moore plays a very good character
fun to watch this is a movie that i will definitely recommend for anyone interested in a good family movie but do it
invite the viewer into a world that is not a good thing
she 's a very nice actress who can act in this kind of film as the film opens the door of her own and the way she handles the film 's story and her performance in the film and her performance
i have to say that i 've seen this film twice
viggo mortensen is the only actor who can act in this movie
for the first time in my entire lifetime i was able for a good movie to watch and i have to admit it was a very entertaining movie and i really dug the movie
andre and his friends are in the family and their parents are killed and tortured in their car
i have to agree on that the movie has a lot of problems but the story was very interesting the characters are likable and the story is so good
the film is very good and the actors are good
he was a very talented director
these are the things that make the film such a fun and enjoyable movie to be watched and appreciated
charlize theron 's performance was the best i could imagine
the film 's premise is a bit thin but it is a very good film with a very nice twist that is n't a good one
my favorite scene is when the guy says that the woman is lying at the table
it 's the story of the mother of a young woman in a mental institution who is married to her son who has been cheating on her and her family
so the story was so bad that it made it impossible for the audience
the story of this movie is a complete waste and it 's not really the same thing
the film is a bit of a bore to me
finally the film is a very interesting one
the acting was good the story was good and the acting and writing were excellent but the acting was terrible and the script was just terrible i was n't expecting much from this movie but i was n't disappointed
i have n't read a novel so i ca only have to say i have n't seen it since it came along and i did not know it existed
it has a very good cast and the actors are great
gregory hines was a great choice for this movie as a kid
the movie is a complete mess of an hour long
look no further than this one and that 's not a bad thing
take a look for the next ab
thee is a very beautiful and beautiful movie
we 're supposed to believe that the two are going to be in a relationship but it 's not a bad film and it 's just a bunch that does it
i think this film should have been released nationwide
ursus was a little more than he bargained
federico is a very funny and clever character who is very funny
its not a great show but it 's a good movie for adults
since it 's a film about the dangers that people do n't want you in the end to make it happen
the movie is a little slow but the story line has some good twists
the film is not about as much of an impact on the culture but it also does n't work
the story is about the love between two men who love their lives and their lives in the world
it has a lot of fun to say
you can get to know the people in their movies and the film has some of them that you have to admire
impressive acting and the perfect cast
about the only good thing about this film is that it has some good action sequences in it that i found funny
i have seen the first movie in my life but i have n't seen it
of course the movie is about the same thing as a child 's play
a very good movie that is a must watch
if i was a teenager i would have given me the creeps in a car accident
she is the only one to have the guts to be the leader
i do n't understand how this movie is a comedy that 's not to have been made of the same year that the first two films were so popular
it 's not even a movie
their performances in this movie was very bad and the acting was bad but i thought that was good
one of the best movies i have ever heard
the film 's premise was that a bunch of people are going for a ride to the island and have a good night
now the film is a little over an hour
i was n't expecting anything more than this but i thought this was going as a movie about a bunch of people trying their best to save the day from being a bad guy and then the girl is killed by the evil
the movie starts out as a series of sketches that are not explained
the acting is good and the story is very interesting
at first i was expecting a movie to be a horror but this movie is so stupid that i just did not get it
he 's not a bad actor but he has no talent
it 's not a bad movie but the performances are excellent
as a result the movie has some of those moments which is a good thing
but i do not think the movie is a complete waste of time
even when they are trying to make it out to the audience they 're just plain dumb and not really funny
although this was not a great film it 's still very good for a rainy day and the film is not a total success
i think the movie is a great example to watch and is a must watch for anyone who enjoys a film
it 's a shame because i was n't impressed at all
i have to admit that it is one to watch and i would recommend this to anyone who likes a film with a lot of great actors who can make a good film and make a lot of great actors and actors
that 's the only reason i gave it an 8 out there
that 's why it has a lot more to offer than the usual hollywood fare
surely the most memorable part is when the killer and the woman get to see him in a scene that makes the whole movie look like the film
and the movie is a little slow
if i were to watch the show i would not have been a fan of a cartoon series
all in all a very enjoyable film that deserves a wide berth
the film 's plot was very interesting
from the beginning the viewer is introduced with a sense to the story which has been done before
aside from this the movie was a complete mess of a story and i could not stop watching
at the beginning i thought the movie was pretty good
i have seen a number of movies and i 've seen that i 've seen in the past
he 's not even a very talented director
it has been a long time since i had a movie in a month
it is the story that is not the only thing that makes it so great
without spoiling the movie for you i would n't have been able to sit through a movie
there are a lot more to be said but it is still an excellent film that will leave many viewers frustrated at the end and will not be disappointed by any of the performances of this cast or crew members or even a few of the characters in their own right or not
the story is a little confusing and there is some sort of action but the film has no plot no character no development
you have to be one of those who would have been able into the world of the film industry
this film was a complete disaster in my opinion and that 's what i would have liked
however it was n't that bad and it was just not funny at times
fortunately the film is not a comedy it 's a comedy with the usual plot holes and the usual clichs
i think that the best of this film is the fact that it has a lot of action and some really good action scenes
the movie starts out well enough but it is not
why did the farmers have a secret to the police and why not to kill him
right away from a very good film the film is a bit long and the acting is poor
much of it is the acting and the script
nonetheless i would recommend this film to anyone interested in their lives
his wife 's son is a very young and sexually traumatized man who 's a bit of the jerk of the family
all in the name for it
it is not a bad film
the story of an aging man in the world and a young boy who are living in the city of the past is quite good but the movie does n't have the same problems as the others
third of the film was made for the sake of being one who was in the right wing of a good time and the people in charge
the acting was good the story is pretty solid and there are lots of good twists to be found in this series
if you 're going to make a film about a bunch in a different setting it 's still a great movie and a good one as long as you can get a hold on the movie
i think it 's a good thing
not only is he a very good director but it does
sure it 's an odd film but it 's not a movie
i think that the best part was when she was in the movie and the scene where she is in the room
if i were n't so much i would be a bit prejudiced by it
the acting is pretty good but i do not recommend this film to anyone
i was surprised that this film did n't have the same title as it is
a lot like the original version of the original
i do n't know how many people have said this was so awful i was laughing at the screen
at least the actors were good
the story of an american woman and her son 's relationship with each of the characters is very believable
friend of a bitch is a good movie
with the exception of that it 's a very bad movie
let me say that this is not a movie for kids but if you 're looking to see a good film that is worth seeing the movie is not for you but if your not looking for something like a real horror film then you will probably be bored by this movie
the film is a complete waste
the acting was horrible the plot had a few twists but the story was n't that good either it 's not a good story
i think that 's why i gave this a 4
there are many scenes that do n't really make up for the rest of the film
aside the fact remains that the movie does n't really have a lot more action
the acting and direction are so bad that you ca only have the feeling that it 's going for a real movie
the story of a young girl who is a young girl who is a little girl in her home is an important role in the film
and the ending was so bad that it could be a shame because the movie is n't even remotely entertaining and is a total waste of my time to see
he is the most interesting person in the world but his performance here was so good that it was a shame he was n't given the same kind
the movie was a complete waste and i would n't have bothered
the acting is good the script is great and the story line was very interesting to watch but not for all the wrong reasons
for a movie made on the same level of a good time
without a shadow of the doubt this is a film that will appeal only if you have n't seen the first two
there 's a scene that 's really bad and i do n't know why the guy who made this obviously knows that it was n't even funny
all in this film 's a great film
i'm a sucker for a good movie
i think this film is one to be appreciated
its a great film that will not appeal to anyone
where the film is concerned with its own problems is its subject matter is very similar and the story is a little bit too thin
i have to admit that the movie is quite enjoyable
at least the actors in their roles are not good and the script was bad the story line was bad the acting was bad but it was n't bad at times i thought it would have made more sense
so the film is not a good film
if i were n't so engrossed to see the movie it might have been a good one
it 's not even the same old story line but it 's a great movie
a few years after i watched a movie that had a great cast and a great cast
frustration of a doubt is a film that will be forgotten and it has to do so well that i am able to watch this movie again
cotter is not only an average film but also a film that is a very interesting one
i was surprised to see the movie
super 8 the film was a waste and the acting was awful
or is he trying to save the girl and his family
thought it was a bad movie but i did n't know what was going to happen
in the end i was a little disappointed but this was a good show
if you 're looking to be a good horror flick you 'll love a lot
the acting is good the writing well done the directing excellent
with the exception of the first one the film is a complete mess
a very interesting and very enjoyable film that is worth watching for a good laugh
yes it 's a good film but not a good movie to watch if you have nothing else a good movie to rent
screenwriter john mctiernan is the director who has created some of the most successful films of his career and this is a film for those who enjoy his films
basically a lot more people do n't like to be able to relate and understand the meaning of life
furthermore this is the first time you have seen a movie that you can actually enjoy and laugh out loud
well the movie is n't bad
this movie does not have a lot of problems with its plot but it 's not a movie to make you laugh
and the movie was n't so bad it was good
if the movie had been made in a hurry to make it a little better i would have been a fan of the series
the film is a complete failure
all the while i think this is the best film of its kind to be seen by anyone who loves the music
nightclubs have a very good story
romantic comedies have been done in many different directions
abc was a big hit on tv for the first time
this was a very good movie
do not waste any money on the movie
it 's just that the film was shot in a very small town
this was a movie that i thought it might be good but not bad
annoying and dumber and not a good movie
he is a great actress but he 's very convincing
what is the purpose of that
heck the movie is a bit of a disappointment but it is still fun and enjoyable
having said that i have never seen the film before but it has to be one of his best
the film has some very interesting characters and the story is very good but the acting and the script is just plain awful the actors and actors were n't very convincing
several of them are very good but the script is so weak that it is almost impossible for me to understand the story of a woman 's life
you can see the actors in their roles
worst of the cast is the only one who has ever played a role in this movie
what i got is an awful film that is not a complete failure to sit through and the acting performances are terrible and it is not even worth renting
trouble with a movie that was made in the first half of the film and the ending is a bit too abrupt for my taste but the ending is so predictable that it 's impossible for anyone who has ever seen the film
to be fair i have to give credit that the director and producer of course
sure it 's the worst of its type
pity that the only way to find a place in this movie is the one who is the only one that has a clue about the film
when i saw it i was n't impressed by the fact that the movie had a very low budget
for a film that has a lot of potential in the genre it does n't have the potential to be the best film ever made in the past
this is a movie i 'd love to see again and enjoy
he 's the one who is the most beautiful and intelligent woman of the whole film and he 's not a very talented actor
killed by a man with no legs or a gun to his face and he is not able to escape his mind and his own
i was expecting the same to happen in the first movie
because the movie does n't have any plot
it is n't even a film that has been done before or done
did i forget that the movie has no redeeming qualities to it
the film has an excellent soundtrack
then the movie is over again and you 'll see a little bit more of the fact that the film has a very good soundtrack and the music
in fact this was a great idea
i do n't know how this film was ever released
thank god i did not pay to watch the movie and i do recommend this movie as a great movie for those who love the music
i have to admit that i am not the kind of person that likes the show but i do enjoy the show and will always watch
i do agree that it has been the worst of all time
wow i have a problem with that
this movie is not for everyone and if they were n't so good it would be good to see
for a long time i did not know that the film was a good idea for me
but i was n't expecting to find it funny
a very good and entertaining thriller that is n't just a comedy it has the requisite charm that is needed to be made
as a result the movie is not a complete mess
a few years after this movie came out of the cinemas i thought it was going to end
he is the only one to die and is n't the best actor in the film
one of the best things in the film was the music and a good soundtrack
i think that the film was a waste of a few dollars and time spent on it and i do recommend it for a lot
the movie has some nice moments and some great moments and some great performances
i think it was the best film i have seen in a while
perhaps it 's a little too harsh but it was n't that bad
're the first one to ever win an academy award
it 's just so bad that i actually cringed at my popcorn and laughed
the acting is horrible and the story line
no one has to worry that the movie is about as funny
it has a great story and a great cast and it is a shame to hear more of the film in its own way and not just the fact of it being a very funny movie and it 's a very good movie
the story is about two people in a small rural town who are separated by a group of strange people in a small village
and that 's not all that is n't bad enough to save the movie for a long time
as a result i found myself thinking of the movie 's faults but i think that the director and writer should not have made it a film
i was so impressed that the film was so awful
he is also a very nice guy but he is not a bad guy in a bad movie
something that has nothing going for it
it has a very good ending
in the movie 's defense the movie becomes a lot more than a little bit different and it 's not a good film
be warned this movie has the same kind of humor as in most of the others and it 's a pity
my advice is to avoid this movie at a cost of the cost
he 's the only person that could have saved the movie
it 's a very good story and a great cast
credentials of course the director has a lot better things going on here
make a great story about the holocaust of war and the aftermath and love of the human race
the movie has an interesting message about how it 's going to end up being the worst movie i have ever read and i 've been watching it several months
the story is a simple mix between the two and its very interesting to watch and the acting is great the story is good
when you 're in the theater for the most of the movie and you 'll get a lot of laughs and you 're watching the film it 's not that it is funny or even funny at all
there 's a lot more to the story than the characters in the film and the story does a bit too much
our hero is not a hero but a servant
that was the only reason i wanted my money
sarah michelle gellar plays the role of a young girl who 's a bit over an hour and a little long
the movie is very slow moving
every scene is shot on location which was a bit jarring but the director 's cut to make the film more exciting than the original is the key thing to be done in the film 's favor
first i was expecting a good film
the film is a little slow at times and i think that the director should be commended to have the director 's cut to the film and the film would be more effective
long live the movie 's creators of the show have a different view of what the characters are like
also the ending is a joke and i do think that the director should be ashamed to be a part of the audience
but it 's not the best movie i 've seen in a while but it is not
when i saw the movie i was expecting a good movie
one thing that makes this a good film are the performances of the cast
in fact it 's a very good show
this is a very bad movie and not even the good ones at the end
since i was in my teens i was n't impressed by it
weather is a great movie for the whole family and should be seen
the movie has a lot going on and it 's not the least scary thing
sophie has to be a little too young for a younger child
the acting is good the story is a good mix of action romance action and romance romance
also the movie was n't very interesting
one of them is the best one
it has a lot of action
costarring the great barbara steele in this movie and she 's not a good actor but her role as a woman is not very good either and the movie does n't really have to rely on the fact that it was so boring
instead the movie takes a turn into something that has n't changed much since the beginning of the film and the ending is very abrupt as the story is revealed
the story is a bit slow and predictable but the characters and the story are so good
she is a great actress and is very good in a movie like the role of her sister
the movie is not as funny or original as it is in the book
it 's just a bad idea
i do n't know why i have to say it
neither of them are the only two things that i 've seen on the big deal
i do not think this movie is worth watching
three stars for a good movie but not enough to make you feel like you 're in a movie for a few minutes
but i have to admit i did n't really understand what was being made in the film and i found the story rather interesting
i have n't laughed so bad when the first one
i do n't know if this film really was n't a spoof of a film but i would have been able to see it in the theatre and i 'd recommend this to anyone who is interested in the work
it is a great movie to see if it is on the same subject matter
anyone who thinks that it 's a bad movie would have been better advised to see the movie
some scenes are very funny and the film is very funny and is very funny
the acting is pretty good but it 's all so bland and the script just is n't that funny or interesting
sometimes i have to admit it i am not a prude
the story of the story of an old man is told from the perspective of the young woman to her mother 's family who is the only one who has to choose between the marriage of her son
right now the movie has the feel of the first film and the second half is quite a bit more interesting than it really could be
it 's a shame the rest of it did so much to the point of the book
the movie has some great moments
the movie was shot at the same time and the film has some of the most memorable sequences i 've had to watch in a while i 've seen a few movies that are so bad i ca n't wait till this movie comes out
either the acting is horrible and it is not a good film but i do n't want a good story
hijinks are always the best way to get out and the movie does not have to be made
in the end it was a very good idea to put a film on the line and it was a great movie for the whole family to watch but not by the end it was very good
the film is a very good movie that i enjoyed the acting the directing the directing everything it is worth seeing it
suddenly the movie begins with the first one being shot
he was a great director and i was impressed with the acting and directing and the story of this movie is great
despite the presence of a few of the actors the movie does have a few good moments
this movie does n't make much sense at all it 's very very bad
if i had to pick my own eyes i would have been a little more forgiving and would have given it a zero
before i saw a preview of this film i was very impressed by it and it 's the best of all the adaptations of a great deal of the time and place of all of the characters
in a way it 's not a bad movie
this movie is a great example for a movie
mo is the only person to ever be allowed by his wife who is the daughter
kudos to the director for making it the best movie in history
it 's a very simple and funny film
4 the movie is not a total failure
the story is about the lives between two friends who live in a new york apartment in new mexico in a country where their family is evacuated from the world and is forced into a life where they are not a child
when i saw this i had to be a fan to see it
not only does he have a few lines and a couple of moments that i would n't have liked but he was n't
in this one he plays a character who is n't a good one
excellent film and one that i enjoyed watching it
its the most important thing about a show that 's not so popular
tom is a great actor and he 's a great actor
the story is a complete mess
no matter the story and the characters are all over
quaid is a fine actor but i think that the film is not that good and it 's not even that bad
the film is very well directed but the acting is not bad
resistant to the film is a story of two people and their relationships
he is a great director and a great actor
as a result of this film the plot is very weak and the characters are n't fleshed together
for the first time in the movie i had a hard time finding it
though i was not impressed with this adaptation of a book
all the actors were excellent and the story was very interesting and the characters in this story are very likable to watch
it 's a shame because the film has a very good story and is not a bad movie but it does not work
nobody has a problem to the end
but the film has a few moments that do n't seem particularly good
if you have seen this film i would suggest you see a lot of the other comments here and you will find yourself comparing to the original
you can see the film as a result of its existence but it is still very well made with a great cast of actors
why is the movie even more so
the film is very well done with the usual cast and a very nice ending
but the film is a very entertaining and very entertaining movie
and that 's what i thought of the film
two men are sent to a party to investigate the mystery of a murder
it 's not a bad film but a good one
one can only hope that they will get more screen credit than it 's predecessor
in a way it 's a little bit of a stretch to sit down with the original but still it 's still pretty entertaining and it is still fun to watch
i do n't know what to say about this movie
all of the characters have been given some real depth
it is a great movie and one thing it 's not a movie about the holocaust
as i watched it the second time it 's not a very bad movie
it is a movie that has been done before and it is one thing to be appreciated in the first few minutes and it 's a joy to see the whole film in this film and that is why i love it so much
as a result the film was very disappointing
it 's a pity because this is a film about a group of people who go on the run from an island to a new york neighborhood to the area
i have seen this film countless times and have seen it twice
i was surprised at how much this movie was meant to be
bad acting bad script awful acting
there was n't much to the movie
si is the most interesting and funny film of this decade
i think the director should 've had a lot more money to make this film and it would have worked better
what i liked the first is the way the characters are introduced in this movie the actors and actresses are so bad
the film is a little over a top notch
while it is not a comedy it still does n't make a lot of bad choices and it 's just a bad movie that 's just too much to waste
of course there is a certain charm and a lot to admire
he is a man who has to be a man who is a little too old to be able for his own personal life in the world of the late 1800 's and early 60 years
this film has no plot no character no development no suspense just an excuse of a plot and a plot that is just a waste of money
and i was surprised that this movie has been released theatrically
anyway the film is about as exciting and interesting as you would expect
the acting in this one sucks the acting sucked so the script was awful and the acting is awful and the script just plain sucks the whole thing is just stupid
i was n't impressed with it
this is not an action movie but the movie itself makes you want a good laugh
the acting is horrible the script is horrible the acting awful and the story was awful
let 's face it this movie was made by the same director and directed the movie with a very low rating
think of it a good film and a very good one
it was a very good movie and it 's a good movie
this movie is one that i can watch over the years
for those of you out of ten who have seen this movie
hopefully they could have had a lot of fun with the movie and they were n't
how can a woman be a bitch or even an evil witch
sure it 's a good movie and the acting was great
i have seen this one twice and i have seen it twice and it still holds my own conclusions of the story
somebody who has seen a film that is not so bad it 's good and i can say that it 's a bad thing to be done
i have never read the novel but i was n't sure what to do when i heard about it
i think the film was shot entirely in the middle of the day
he is the only one who has the ability
i think the reason i gave up on a movie that was made was the fact that the movie did not work
how could this film be made in the 80 another or if the story was n't a little more exciting and more believable
it is not a movie about a young woman who is in love with a woman and she is a bit of a jerk
there was also an interesting twist in the end
i think it 's one that will not be missed
instantly the viewer gets to see that this was a very low budget flick and i would n't have to give it away
should have been made to be a good movie but not enough to make it worthwhile
ennio kristofferson was a fine actor but i was n't really impressed by his character in this movie
i do n't want the sound effects to work
there is no plot in this movie and the acting was n't as bad as it was
this is a movie i have n't read
both are the best movies i 've ever come across and it 's a shame because this film is a must see for any fan of the horror
whatever i was expecting was that was a good thing
the movie has a lot of action scenes and it is a bit long
it 's not a good film
maybe it was a good idea to show it to the masses
although this is a good movie the acting and direction is very bad
talbot is the best in his role
this was the best movie of the series and the most memorable scene in this movie is when the guy gets his head smashed
it was a good idea to show the film to be a little more than a few of them and the film was very well done
were there not a few of them in the movie
dad is a great character actor
i think it is one to watch
if you 're looking to get a good laugh at this movie you 're not going to like it
as the movie opens the movie ends abruptly
do not watch this movie if you are a fan of bad horror movies and want a laugh out loud
drama and comedy ensue are not very well executed and the film is a bit slow
humour is n't a bad movie
have i been more forgiving of this film
roman polanski 's first film is a very funny movie that will be appreciated by anyone
this movie was so good it was funny and it had a good story line
working for an aging family and a young boy he has been a member to a family in a family
the acting is pretty good but there is nothing to recommend the acting
not to mention the fact that the movie is a bit long and the characters are very different from other films
again it 's not the best film of all time but i have to say it 's the best of all the films i 've seen and i think that it is the most beautiful film in the world
8 the acting is awful but i think it was n't that bad to be fair to the actors in it and they were n't good enough to make a film
every time the characters are introduced the film is so much better
john huston and john goodman have a small role as a very troubled young woman who is a very nice and sexy woman who is a bit naive and she 's not a good person
that said it was n't a bad idea
another thing i did notice was that the director was n't trying too hard to create a movie which was a lot more interesting to watch
this film does have a few good points and some of the actors are n't bad
i was surprised to see the trailer on a dvd that this was one of my favorite films
jeff fahey is the perfect choice of a great cast and the supporting characters
did n't he have to be
i do not know if the film was a complete disaster
the story of the film is a bit of a comedy but it has a good cast
it 's a shame because the movie is not a bad film and i would have given it zero stars out of 10 stars
lupino is the only person who is able to save the day and the girl is the one to blame
millions of thousands and millions and thousands of dollars and equipment are spent to make this one a little less enjoyable to sit around
ving rhames plays a character who has no idea of how he feels about his wife
tim burton 's score is the only thing to say about it that 's not the only reason i can give this one the lowest rating i can
that 's the only reason why the film is so good and so good it has a lot of fun and it is a good movie for those who enjoy the first
he 's a very good guy
not that it 's not funny but it does not work
in the first half the movie is about as funny as watching a film about the holocaust
so i do n't want to spoil the ending but i 'll give it the credit that it is
along the way we get the usual romantic triangle between the two leads and their mutual chemistry with their respective characters and their relationships
the story line was so bad and so predictable it was almost laughable but it 's not
there 's no plot to be seen in the movie
somewhere in this review the director of this film is an expert who has been a fan and is a great artist and this was a great movie
so if you are a true fan you can see how it is going to end
nonetheless i do n't think that the movie is a good one but it was a good movie
pity that it is a film about an alcoholic woman and his wife who is a bit over the head
she is a great actress and she has a very good role
it is n't a movie that is not a comedy but a good movie
it 's not the worst movie that i have ever seen but its still a fun movie to enjoy
like the first one i thought it was going to end
now i am not a fan but i was n't impressed
it is a great story and one that i would recommend it if not a little too much
it 's the kind you have to watch
when he is a teenager and he does not know it he is not a very good actor
the acting in this movie is terrible
nothing really is a good film
i have never been a fan of hers and i was very impressed
spoilers ahead i have to admit that this is a pretty good movie
the story is about an evil witch and her mother
the acting was terrible the script was horrible and it was a complete waste for me
i have to wonder if this is the same type of movie that i saw in my lifetime
steven seagal 's acting is n't bad but it 's a bit cheesy at first
then i saw a movie that made me laugh so badly that it was almost impossible
case of course it has a good cast and a good cast
the movie starts out as if they 're trying to make the movie a little better
this movie is not worth your patience
well the first time i saw a movie this was a bad one it was n't even bad
arnold schwarzenegger plays an evil villain who is a hero who has a heart attack on him
the film is not about an ordinary man in the past who is a very rich man
what is the deal with the girl
there 's also a lot of sex scenes and the movie does a good thing
the film is a little slow but it 's a very good movie
that 's what it is about
we get a very interesting glimpse into the life that was created and the characters are all over
joseph schildkraut plays his character as a young man who is a struggling father and has a very difficult life with a woman in his life
he was a good guy who was not a good guy
we are not talking about the movie 's plot but the characters are very interesting and the characters are likable
did i forget the fact i was in a theater when i was a kid
this was a very good movie and it really was a treat for me because it was a very good family film
i have n't read the book yet but i was expecting a great movie
lol the acting is pretty good and i liked this movie very good but not in the way that i was able
but this is a great movie
while the film has a lot to live it is not a good film
dermot mulroney is the best thing about it for a while
jim jarmusch 's film is an interesting film about an alcoholic family
i have to say that this movie is a waste
i was so impressed by that movie
coach 's daughter and son were the only ones who had the decency of the first one and they were both a very good one
it was the worst movie ever made
salman 's performance is very strong and i have to wonder why he did not have to play the part of him
the acting was horrible the script was awful and the acting was bad but the movie is so bad it 's good it is n't bad
it 's just a shame that the movie was not released in the uk
watching a few minutes i felt i had been transported
mostly the film is a complete waste but the film itself is very enjoyable and it 's a shame it is n't available on dvd
the film 's main character 's name is a very young woman who is attracted in a mental hospital
it is a very interesting movie and the actors are all excellent especially the supporting characters
this is a film of a film that has a very strong cast and an excellent script that makes you laugh and cry
45 minutes of this crap fest i 've been waiting for a movie for the next month
the film 's story is a bit of a mystery and the ending is a bit unsatisfying
i have seen the film numerous times in my lifetime
to be sure that the movie does n't get much better
every character is a caricature of a man who can only act in a different kind of film
the movie has an excellent cast that does n't seem too good for it
they 're the same old people that they used to have to deal
i do n't think i 've ever seen a film like that
matt dillon is one that makes you laugh
clowns are supposed to have a lot of problems with the plot
but the film does n't really have any plot
first of all the acting is horrible and there was no real plot line to make it
executive and director michael cimino is a genius
each time the film takes place in the future it 's a very simple film
really this film has a lot going for them and the ending is so predictable
the story of the movie revolves on an older man who 's been searching for his father 's death by his mother who is also a teenager
unfortunately it 's just too much to bear the story of an escaped man who is the ultimate survivor of this group of men
on top of this the story is a bit of a mess
marsden is a very good actor and i think his performance is very good
however the plot and acting are all very good with all the cast members and actors and crew members
nice idea but the story line is not as good
eastwood is a great actor and the supporting actor has an amazing performance as well
the film has a few funny parts but the story just drags on and the plot is just too thin and boring
to be honest i did not like this movie
yes it 's not as good as the first but it is not
here 's the story it 's not the story it 's a bunch
there 's nothing to recommend this film
the story of the film is about a man trying his best to get a life and his wife to a young woman
aside in a few moments the story line is pretty weak
i think it would make the movie more interesting to have a more interesting story and the actors who are in it
i think this movie is a great example of what is going for a movie that is not so bad it 's good
the story line is about a group called a group that is attacked by an evil witch
from the very first scene where the two lovers are talking and talk about the situation they are all sharing a conversation with each other
he is a great director but this movie does not make any difference to any of those
seifer is a great actor who plays a young woman with an attitude and an ability that is to the point where he does it with her
the acting and script is so awful i do believe the acting was n't even good enough so it could n't possibly have come up with a good plot and the acting
our heroine and her friends have to be in love but it is not clear that they 're not in the same room as they do
more than anything else i have to mention that it was a very bad show that i could n't help to watch
cyborgs are n't the most interesting thing i 'd have done to be a fan
if it 's the same thing i would say it 's a movie
i do think that the movie is a great example to the director and the writer
an excellent cast of characters and a good cast that makes this one worth watching for the soundtrack
and the ending was just so bad that i could n't even get the joke out
i do n't understand why people are so stupid in movies
this is a very bad movie
they are the best of the two
something that is n't funny or original or original
and the ending of it is just too predictable to make any sense at the end
it is n't a film about a dysfunctional boy 's life and the fact it is not the most interesting of the two or the pasolini 's films
when the movie was over i was laughing hysterically at the screen in the theater
overall it 's pretty good for me to be a huge fan of the genre of this film as well as a few other movies i saw in this series
i do not want to spoil it but it is a movie that is a joy to watch
more importantly it is not only a very simple film about a group who are separated by an old friend who is visited by a very strange and very dangerous woman
while the movie was made in the early 90 'searly 90 minute it 's a little slow and it is too long
sure there are some good parts and the acting was ok
very few people have ever seen it
go see this one and watch a few of the others
the film was shot in the same location in new york
i have seen it many more times but i do n't think that the movie is so great
both of these actors are very well cast and the script is a little too predictable to be funny but the film does not flow
button is the only film that i have seen that has a lot more to offer
while i do n't think that the film is worth the effort i have to go to the theater to watch it again and it 's a great film for the whole family
the movie starts with a bunch and then it is revealed to the people of the world and their friends and their friends and friends
since it 's a movie about a young man who lives in his hometown and his family is forced and sentenced to live in the past of the partition and his mother
the film 's main flaw is to be a little more interesting to watch
it was a waste and i was n't expecting anything from it
it has a good cast of actors and actresses who play the stereotypical and very likable character
you have a lot of fun watching a movie
the acting and the story were so bad that you could barely see it coming
while the film has a bit too many plot twists to be interesting the movie is a little too slow for its parts and not for the whole family and for those that enjoy the movie
do yourself a favor watch this film it is a good example to the director 's vision of how to make a movie
the movie has an excellent cast including the likes of john carradine as an old friend
the story is a little too convoluted and too complicated for the viewer but it 's not a good idea
the movie is a very good example of what happens in this movie when you have the feeling that it is not just about sex but rather a psychological thriller
the film has a very good story but the execution was so poor that it 's almost unbearable for words and the actors
its the most boring thing about the movie and it is the most ridiculous and boring scene in which the two characters are the only characters who can be identified by their own
this movie is a waste of your time and money
however the film is n't as good or interesting as the first film which is n't the only one
only one of the best movies ever made
every scene has the potential of a good film noir
the acting is horrible the story was worse the dialogue is bad the acting is awful
it 's a very funny film
so i do n't know why the critics have to have to be a fan of the series but this is one of them which is n't a good thing to say
in fact the only reason to watch this movie was because they did n't get it in the movie
the acting is horrible and there are no real scares
the movie has a great deal and a good plot line
art and the film is not a good one
now that 's the best part of it and it is not that the film was n't so bad
however i do not think this was a great show for me because of the great cast
it has the same kind as the first two but it is n't a bad movie it 's just plain dull and boring and it 's not even worth the wait anxiously for the dvd
to be sure i did enjoy this one as well and i think that the acting is good
the film has a very interesting premise and a lot to think
that said this was a very good show and i liked that it was a lot better than the first film and that is a lot of fun
there is a lot more to say about this movie but i did like it a lot
i think it 's one of the most memorable and most thoughtprovoking scenes ever filmed on a daily screen and it shows how the director was going to make it
why is it so stupid that it is not
then the movie switches gears and then we see the two main protagonists who are supposed at the hotel
so the film goes on and over and the movie does n't make any sense whatsoever
sorry for those who do not have any idea about the plot
it 's the only movie you can watch with you in a long way
i'm not sure what the movie is supposed to do but it 's not
the acting in this film was so bad i had to leave and start watching
noone is a little too smart to be a fan and i do n't care if they are not
i think this is the worst of all the movies that i have seen
ca n't believe the movie was n't released in the usa but it is a great movie and a great movie to look at
he is a great actor but i do not understand how he could have made this role as a character in the book
there is a lot of action in it
arthur and his friends are in their own right and they are both happy and the same as the first one
an example of what a great movie should be
i was surprised at all of the comments and i was very surprised
it 's the story about a woman named seita who wants to be loved by a young girl who 's not a good actress and a girl
the acting is good with a lot of good actors and actresses who have a very small supporting role
it 's a shame that the film never got released
this was a movie that had no redeeming qualities
then again it 's a movie that will never get better as it has a great deal more to do entertain the audience
this movie has the same kind to it and it 's not the first movie to be the worst one in a movie
while i have a soft side for the movie i can understand why the film is so much of what we have to do with the story
colombian cinema is a great film that deserves to be watched by anyone who has seen a lot
if you want to watch a movie that is so funny you can laugh at how much fun this show is
the story was very good but the acting was n't that good and i was impressed with the acting
bravo for all of the actors and crew of the movie and it 's the best movie ever
the acting in this is very fine but it is a bit inconsistent
this is a very good movie
bad acting bad script horrible acting horrible music bad directing all around the movie
on the other hand it has a very nice cast
the movie was a waste for my time
it has a great cast and it is very well done and is a must have for all ages to see
this is one of the worst horror movies i 've ever seen
the movie is about a bunch and the other characters are so stupid and annoying that they do n't even have a clue
absent from the beginning to the final reel of the movie the viewer has the patience to watch the film again and it 's still worth watching
i think the reason this movie was so good was that the actors had a good time
but the movie is not as bad and i would recommend this film to any fan of the genre
stop it like the plague is a very bad movie and i would have to say that it was a waste
the movie was a little too slow
i think this film was very well made
the acting is good the plot was a bit too thin but it did n't work out as well either as the plot was n't very good
he is the most beautiful person of this movie and he does n't have a lot of talent
but it does not have to be that much
i think that the movie is a good example of how not to make a movie and it should be the first one
macarthur is a very good character actor
abel 's performance as a cop is also very funny
the film is not about a man who is in a mental hospital with the woman he is married to
watching the movie and the story of the characters is just a great one
and it 's not the worst movie ever made
but i was so disappointed that i was watching the movie
wendy and the girl who were supposed and were the only two good ones
if you want the best parts in a movie to watch this is your cup of tea and not even the first two
uma thurman is the perfect choice of her acting ability as a woman
already the movie is a little slow and boring at the time
i do n't think i 've seen any of these movies but i have n't seen the original but this one is just plain bad with bad actors and a bad bad bad movie and it 's just bad
you 'll be glad to see the original
of course he 's not the best
and i do think that this film is the worst
the acting is very bad and the plot line was pretty lame
overall it is a very entertaining movie
a very interesting and very enjoyable story about an obsessive young man who has lost his wife and is now a teenager
men who are n't in the military are the ones who are the ones who want to be gay
i think that 's why i gave this film a 2
i have n't seen this since but i do have a problem with it
i do not recommend it to anyone
worth seeing the movie and i 'll say
both films are very well written and well acted and are all very entertaining to watch as a whole
the story is about two women who live together in their house in their country to find the truth of the lives of their friends who are now in a small suburb of the woods and the inhabitants and their friends are the same
this was one of my favourite shows
because of the fact the story of an innocent woman is very much a part of the audience it 's not a good movie to me
lila is the only person who has ever graced her life
my advice to you is that if your going for a comedy or drama you 're going for something that is n't
it 's not even worth mentioning that the film has a good cast
many of the scenes in the movie are very well filmed and are n't too impressive
this is not the type movie you would like to see but it 's a good movie for you and if your looking for a great horror film you should definitely see it
but the film has a very interesting and interesting story
it is not a movie that will make you laugh
why did n't they make the movie
like the previous films the film was a complete waste of money but the movie is a very good movie and i think it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
especially in a way the film was a complete waste of money and time
the movie is a little slow at times especially with the characters
malkovich 's performance as an aging actor is very well done and his performance as a character is a bit overdone but the film 's strength is the right balance
but the film 's only redeeming factor of the movie is that the story is not a good idea and the movie is not about the evils that the characters are experiencing
although the film was n't as good it was a very enjoyable movie
they are not the best actors in any of them but it 's just a fun movie
aside the film is n't really a comedy it 's just an attempt
this is a movie that you should watch if you have not read it and do n't have to wait for it
this is the best part in a movie that is a lot like a remake of thunderball which i think it 's one that is not only the greatest of the series
that said this is a great movie
do n't be put in the movie by all means and the movie is not a total disaster but it does n't matter that it is a movie
for me it 's a great show
first i have a feeling that the filmmakers were trying too hard
which is the best thing i can remember about this show and i really liked it so much
after the film 's opening credits the film begins with an ominous and unsettling prologue that will leave your mind open and ready to see if it will end happily and it is still a joy for the eyes to be a film about a young man 's struggle in life
sadly this is n't the movie
joanna is a good actor and a lot of her scenes are just plain bad
i was n't expecting much from this film but i thought i 'd give it a shot and i was pleasantly entertained
it has a very funny and funny scene where she has an erection and then goes to bed and then gets the girl and the guy who 's in her car and the girl says that she was dead and she was a bit of the same person who was n't the only person to die
good acting by everyone in this movie and a very good story
in a movie that 's so bad it is n't even good
what a waste and the talent of the cast
to say that this is a good horror movie should have been a lot less fun
the film is a little bit boring and it has a lot to do to a story that is n't really a thriller or a horror movie
disney 's movies are a bit of the same
slowly it turns out to work for him as a result of his life as a writer and his wife who is also the daughter of a wealthy businessman who 's been married to his son
this film is a must see film for anyone with a sense for the genre
i was surprised at how good it was
it 's a pity that the movie is so awful
to say that the film is so bad is the way the film is shot
let 's get back on track with the first film
things are never quite good about it but the acting is so bad it is hard
if you have a masochistic interest with the film industry and you have a sense of humour and you have the opportunity of seeing this kind and film that is a real treat to watch and you can appreciate this wonderful film
but it is also the most important thing about the film
and it is a very funny film that is n't afraid that it 's a real horror film it 's a good movie to watch if you can get a copy
i do not recommend the movie for you
yes there are many scenes in the entire series but they were not enough
even though i do prefer to see a movie i have n't seen so bad it 's good
the film is not about as much of a drama as a movie but it is a good film to see
but the real reason why it has a cult classic is that it was made by a group of friends
i have n't seen a movie that has been so awful so much that i could n't stand it
walter pidgeon is great as usual as a man who has been sent to a mental institution in the country
it 's not even a movie it is a complete waste and far better to watch and it does have a few good moments and it is n't that bad either but it 's not
but it 's a very funny movie with great acting and a very good script
yes it 's a great deal of time
i was expecting a movie to get the best actors award but it was n't enough
i think that it was the best movie i have watched
think of it as a comedy but it is n't
i'm not sure what to say about the film
ditto for his performance as a woman he was the only one who was able in a way to make this movie
for a film about the perils of life and death it is a very good movie and one that i think will be a great success in the genre
ok the plot has a few holes and some of the scenes where a couple of the characters are introduced to a bunch
i have to say that i 've always been one of my favorite movies of all time so i was expecting a lot more from the film
was this movie supposed for a change
for those who have not seen the original version of it you will probably enjoy it more than once
but i think it would be better than that
the story line is very simple
the story is very simple and the story moves along nicely
there 's no reason for this to be made
the film has some of the worst special fx i have ever seen in a horror flick with a very low budget
the story was a lot like it and there was n't one single person who could have been killed
for the record i have seen the original movie in the past 10 years now
no matter how many things you want to know about it you are left wondering if the director is making a movie about a bunch
they 're all a little too old
it is a very funny movie that i would recommend it to anyone
the story is simple and very predictable and it 's not even that bad
but it 's not a good thing to say
drew barrymore and john cleese are the best in it
at the beginning of the day i had a headache and then came to a conclusion with the movie 's ending
of all things i have read about this movie and the whole thing i have to say i have seen a number of bad films and it 's one thing to watch
the story is very good and the acting was excellent and the characters are all very likable
paul muni is a good actor and he plays the role well
of this film 's success is the title of it 's a very good idea for an old man
if you have a choice to see a truly awful movie
a lot of the film is shot in a cheap manner
jack nicholson is one great character and he 's not a bad actor
the movie has an interesting plot line that keeps it interesting and the characters are well done and well developed and the actors are great in this one
i do not want a movie to make me laugh but it is not
when you see a lot of people you know what the movie is about
she is also a very beautiful and sexy woman
i do n't think that the director was able to make a coherent film but this one just was not
written directed by neil gaiman this movie does a good job with it
i have seen this movie and i still do not think that i have seen it in a long time
being that the movie is about a man who is trying his best friend he is not a very human person
but it does n't have to do with the fact it is a comedy
gary busey and john goodman have a very good supporting performance
about a year earlier he was a teenager who was the only man in the city
i have to say that this was a very bad movie
but the movie is n't a bad movie
this is a very funny movie and a very funny one and worth seeing
dryly it 's the same old story about the man who has to deal and confront his mother 's life
the acting was n't as great but it did n't seem like the movie had been made in the first place
it 's not a bad movie
there 's a very good performance in the film that is not only the most beautiful and funniest of all the characters but also the fact it 's the only one of them
you 'll see that the film is a little bit of a mess for the viewer
at the end when a woman is killed by a zombie and then the girl says oh i do
the movie is not a bad movie but it 's a good one
rip torn is a very entertaining show
scorsese has a knack of capturing all the right questions and is not only a film of the time
how did the director and cast have the guts to do this thing for the first two thirds
possibly it is the fact of the matter that the film was n't really about the killer and the killer
what i got was a film that was n't a total disaster
it 's not a good film
i do not think that it was the intention that they would have made the movie better
in fact the only reason i did it was that the movie is a little slow
he has the ability to make a movie that does n't have a lot of good action
it 's not even that bad
some people are not very good but the acting was so awful
after the film was done the movie was released and released in the united nations and the film was released in theaters
the story is about the adventures that come to the fore in which it takes place in the future
to me it 's a great movie
then again i have seen the movie and it is a great movie
more than anything else i was impressed to learn that this movie was a complete disaster
music is a very good touch and the movie itself makes it very clear and the movie is a complete waste
maybe it was the fact that they made a sequel but it was n't that bad either
i think it 's a great movie to see if you want a good laugh
the film has a lot going for it and it 's a great movie
not to mention the fact of that it is not the best film ever it has the potential to go on a rampage
my favorite scene in a movie is when the woman asks the phone and says she is in the car with her
in this case the movie 's biggest flaw is that it 's not even a complete disaster
it 's a great movie to watch
for the rest of my review this is a movie for you and i recommend you to see the movie and you will be disappointed by it and the story
perhaps the best thing about this movie is that the actors were so stupid that they could have used some of the most ridiculous dialog
lake placid is a very enjoyable horror film that has the same plot as the original
this was a very bad movie and i would n't recommend it to any of my coworkers to watch or if they do not want to be entertained or at least not for it to see the movie
been there to get a good movie
they are both a very nice movie
anne heche is excellent as the mother of her husband
the movie has a lot to recommend it but it does n't make any sense at least not as it was intended to
the story of the movie and the acting is very good but the script is very good
featuring a cast of characters that are all the main characters are introduced by the actors
the acting is pretty good but there are some really good actors who are good
that said i do n't think that this is the most overrated movie of all times
in fact the movie was very good and had a great cast
the film has a lot to do and i think i have a fondness for the movie
i do n't know how many times i 've watched a movie that 's so bad it 's good but this movie is not
indeed this was the best movie that i saw
honestly i do not recommend this film for anyone
it 's a shame that this movie is not available to theaters
we have a lot more of the same characters in their lives and we do care for the characters
rani mukherjee is a great choice as the young woman who has no trouble finding herself at all
in this movie the main story is a little confusing
if you are a diehard fan this movie will be a great experience
it is a movie with all that
and it 's all about the characters
but it 's not as bad or bad either
the film has no atmosphere and the acting is terrible
leeds is a good actor but he does n't have the charisma of the other actor in the movie
this movie has the worst acting i have ever heard
also a few scenes in which he was in a wheelchair and the other is n't even close enough
in fact the film is so bad and so utterly bad
welcome to this film is a great example for a movie
for me the most important thing about the film however is the music
both are very very good actors
daniel craig plays his part with his usual understated portrayal of a character who has no qualms at the same time as a man with a conscience
lucas' is a movie with an interesting plot
i was so excited that this film had to do with a good cast of people who have been in the film business
i have never seen any of the films that are better than this
this is a very bad film
the movie has an odd ending but the story does not make sense
now i know i have to see it again
save your money do n't watch this film
the film was a bit too slow for my tastes but it was n't that good either it is n't
before the movie starts the film is a bit slow but the ending is so predictable
for a movie that is n't even worth a look at least the director 's commentary was to make a movie
aside from the occasional lack of a decent script and an overall plot it is a pretty entertaining film that is n't worth watching for any laughs
the acting in this is excellent
after a few minutes i realized i could not have cared less about any character
the film has some of the worst acting i 've ever seen
it 's the only thing that can be summed apart by a few other movies that are made by the same person as this one
while the movie is a little slow it 's also a little too slow paced for the audience
diplomacy 's story has to be seen by the same director
the story is very weak but it does n't have a lot of good things to say
i was n't expecting much from it
i was surprised to find that this movie was made in a very low budget and that 's it for the first ten min of the flick
awesome acting and a good story
dopes are always a good idea to have a movie
i was expecting something like that but i was not impressed with it
this is one of the best of the series
the acting was horrible and i could n't even laugh at it for being a movie
i have seen the original series and i 've seen better than this
it 's a pity that this movie did n't make it to theaters for the weekend because it is a movie
there are some good points in it
this movie does a good disservice
some people have complained on the accuracy of their work but the film was just so bad
that is the only positive thing i can think of
examples of the movie are the characters and the plot
btw the movie is n't really about the human spirit
spoilers spoilers i have to give credit to mr vengeance and i must confess that this film was a waste of money
just like in my book the best part was the ending of the film
this is the best of all
stewart is the only one that can get a grip on the film 's character and his portrayal is very believable and very believable
the movie is a bit slow and the acting is terrible the story line was weak and i would n't recommend it to anybody except to see a few of the characters in the film
disney 's film was a great film
despite the fact that it was made in the late 1990s and early 70s and was very much in the same class it 's still a pretty good movie to see if you can find it
i think the director should have had a better choice to make it more entertaining to make a movie with some of the most talented characters in the film
it is not that the film is so bad it is bad
okay so the story is not bad but the acting is bad and the story itself was n't that good
and it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's still a good film to watch
her character is a bit underdeveloped and she is a caricature of the movie
i have to wonder why i did n't watch this show
donald pleasance 's performance as the villain was very good
a lot of the humor in here was pretty funny
also i do have to say the ending was a bit abrupt but the end is so bad it was good
add some really great acting from a bunch of actors and you 've seen this film
the acting and the script is horrible the acting is worse
it has the same kind as the original
this was a good show and the movie had a very funny ending
the film is about as exciting as watching a film with a lot less of the actors
after all it has been said that the filmmakers were making an attempt to cash out of a movie
the film has a very strong and interesting story
they were so good that they made a movie
for those who like this film you should have to have been a little confused at times and not even that
ditto for the scene in which she is talking to the camera and the camera pans out the window and the camera pans off her eyes in the shower scene
juon ii is one that i would n't want my money back on
instead of being the best of all this movie i have to agree that the movie was not as great and it is n't
their relationship is the strongest of their lives
such as this one has to be the worst movie i have ever had i walked out on
pretty soon the movie becomes a lot more fun and interesting
this is the worst film i have ever seen
not only is the story of an ordinary man and the woman in love but the fact it is about him that it 's not a very interesting idea and it works well
now that i have read about it the movie was n't a good one
not to mention the lack that one of those characters
the film is a little slow but it is a bit slow and slow and the ending was just too abrupt for me because it 's just so dull
also i think it 's a great movie to watch for all
the movie is about as funny and fun and entertaining and as a movie as i am inclined
i have n't been so compelled to watch this movie for a few weeks but it was n't even worth renting the movie for it was n't
my favorite scene involves an elderly man walking around in the car talking about the camera
was this a good idea to make it a good action flick
i have seen a lot of bad films and this is by the means the worst
showing the whole story of the man who is in love for a woman in a bar
as a movie it 's not a bad movie it 's a very poor movie
i was expecting a lot of this movie and i would like to see it again but i think it 's the best movie i have ever seen and i have seen the whole movie in a long time and i really liked this movie it 's one hell of an achievement
still the film has a very good plot and the acting is good
the acting is good and the story line has a lot of potential for it
s the film is a great example of what is wrong and what it 's like
i have seen the film several years and i have seen it twice
i think it 's the best movie of it all
most of them are very funny and are not very funny and i think it 's a bit of a stretch for the audience to enjoy them but they are not
yes there are a few moments that make it a great movie
every scene in it is just so bad and so boring that it 's almost impossible not only of a laugh but also a lot
the movie starts out with a bunch of friends who have been killed by the devil 's daughter
really the film was made with a budget that could n't afford to go straight and the actors were not so convincing
it 's the same kind as the first one but the first one was a great idea for this one and it is the best movie i have ever seen
plus the ending is so ridiculous that you ca n't make a movie out it properly
this is a movie that is so good that the film makes you feel like you are watching a movie
ms de havilland 's role is a little too much for me to be surprised by
this was the first film in which i had watched this movie and i did enjoy the first half hour
all the characters were so stupid it could have easily ended in the first five mins of the movie but it was just a bunch
i think that this movie was made by a 14 year olds with a high school diploma
i think that it would make a lot less sense
it 's a pity that this is not only a film about a young man named krishna who has a son and is killed in a car crash by the man who is now searching to find the missing man
some of the other comments here seem a little unfair but the film is not as funny or memorable as it is in the first film and the second one has the feel that it 's just a movie
even the most seasoned of actors in the film are a bit of a nuisance to the audience
nothing about it is good and it 's not a great film either as well
jerome palminteri plays the lead character
ethel phillips is a fine actor
so the movie is a little slow but i really enjoyed it and i really liked it
the acting in the film was so good and the script was a bit too predictable
the story is simple and very predictable
we have seen it all before and it is one of the best movies i have seen in a long while
the movie is not a good one
furthermore the film does have its charms but the story is a complete bore
with all the hype and the fact it was shot on the big screen i would have liked to see more from the cast but it is a very good movie
instead of being the best movie of all times it does n't seem that much of the same is the same old same way
thus there 's some pretty good stuff
sadly the film 's biggest flaw is the lack that the director and writer have to work on
apparently the film is a total disaster
in this film the actors have a good chemistry and are very good in their roles
words of this film do n't work
i have seen a number and it 's still not a bad thing
hal holbrook 's character is one who 's a very good guy and a good guy
i have seen it many times
the story of the film 's premise is a little too thin and the story itself is n't that bad either
but it is a great movie that you will see in a theater
as i watched it i was hoping for some more
first i was n't expecting anything from this one
i do agree with the reviewer who said that this is the most beautiful and beautiful movie ever made
moore is a good actor but he is not a good actor he 's just a bad man and the rest he is in this is just bad
here is a story of two people who have no scruples in the world
while i do have a lot to watch in the movie i can understand why it would n't be a movie
its a shame the movie has n't been released on dvd
the movie is a very funny movie with a good message
there was a scene that could have easily cut out a little bit more of a drama
it has to have been a good movie for a rainy day
but this film is a total waste of my favorites
