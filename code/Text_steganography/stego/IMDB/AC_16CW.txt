it is a shame that it was n't made on a budget of 1 and the movie is too long
wife gertrude is a very good movie about a mother who has been living in the past of a woman in a country
itv had done a number of movies and television shows so they were n't really all that great
in fact there is absolutely no reason for this to be made because the movie makers are either very good or at least interesting as it may seem if all is not really the case
i ca n't even imagine how this show ever got nominated for an academy award
it is so poorly shot and badly directed that its untrue
this is another example of what the film is trying to achieve
especially if you have a couple of mates who get to know the characters and get their comeuppance for their children as they get their head kicked
but the film is really great in every way
overall this is a wonderful thriller
yes we have the characters but we never really get to know them
it 's a pity that this was n't the first film to have the success of its success
it is very sad to see him in such a bad movie
so many other films made during the late 1930 's when the new wave of music is done as a film
note how they all go to make a movie of this film
instead he 's a real human being
richard widmark in the role of the king of the universe is a strong villain who does n't want to be too busy and not so much to the point of being the villain
i thought this was another movie to follow the book
it 's a great movie and a great example of why a movie is a failure from the first
stomach of a man is a very good movie
for those who were the ones who did n't love it
the film also has the same theme which could not be used in the book
most importantly the film is not particularly exciting
many people have already commented on this movie
diane lane is one of my alltime favorite actors she is great as always as a person who 's always been married
i have seen a lot of bad movies
in the original film we see a young man and his wife in love in a world where everything is revealed
it 's an odd way to spend a cent on this film
as for the other people who say that i agree they 're not very accurate
he 's an idiot and an actor who 's a big muscular liar who was a bit more suited than he would normally in today 's comedies
only one thing you can notice about this is why is it so bad
its not that the first film does a better job on the actors than they are
apart from the occasional gore factor this show is not just a cheap cartoon it has an excellent cast and all the performances are all very good especially the actors in the film
the movie just was just plain terrible and stupid
will he be the first child who has ever seen her
essentially the film was a success in this world but it is definitely not the only movie that the filmmakers do n't seem to have been able to make
i 've seen worse acting in the movies
it 's not so much a film as a study on the evils of war and the way of life it depicts an innocent man and his mother and his struggle to be able to control himself
however there 's also a lot of nudity
what a waste of time and money
you ca n't have any real movie about the evils of life of this man nor the consequences it seeks to tell
maxx 's life is a little too predictable and dull with some of the main characters
amitabh bachchan and james stewart make you feel uncomfortable
what a load of crap this movie has
gregory peck who plays the wife and the supporting cast is excellent
also some of those in the cast are particularly excellent but this is not as well done as the story which i can say from the outset on the story and the acting
if you 're looking for an enjoyable horror flick about a man named satan 's character then go see it
my advice skip this abomination and watch the original
and when the young girl was killed she was rescued for it because she is the only person who does what she can and do something about it that she is the only person he is killed by the police
the film itself is also noteworthy at the same time as the one in which the film is set on the screen
the film also looks like they should have been shot with the sound off with the sound of it
or maybe not because the script is very bad because it is n't a thriller
there are several moments that do n't seem to fit in with the rest of the film
i thought the whole thing was pretty interesting but not too bad as the whole film was in the middle
that is the story of the film
7 the main characters are very well portrayed characters who are so good the story is a bunch of kids who get married and have sex with each other
it 's a film and i 'd suggest it to anyone to see it
the plot of this film was just a little too bad to be interesting
to the person who loves this movie and i do not want to comment on it you can go and see the film in a very clear context
if you have n't already heard about the original version of the movie you will have a very good time
it 's also a very interesting movie that keeps you interested but you just ca n't take it seriously
you will love him so much and i did n't
as for the acting well this movie had a lot of potential to play a great character
if you 're in high school at a college party you have to make this movie and to get the message done by everyone 's taste and not just a bit of humor and it is a good film if it is n't
yeah there are moments where the camera is supposed to be and the scene cuts at the scene and the movie looks like it was shot by another shot
check out the original series by the same director
as a result in this case it 's just an excuse to cash in on the success of hollywood
i had hoped i 'd give it a ten because it made me wonder for me
that 's not the kind of movie that i think most people would like
a couple years after the film 's release it is a little more of a movie than its contemporaries
knightley is the best and most underrated film actor
i would like to say that a little bit of the movie is good
we were all in stitches and did n't really know about the rest
however if the story had been played by more than a few and would 've been less interesting it 's not so far the way it should be
the story is so thin so predictable and so predictable that you ca n't care less about it or its characters and then just take on the story
the script is n't really a big deal to make a movie
i ca n't imagine how anyone could rate this piece of crap as a 10
sinuhe is a very likable character but he never really gives the impression of the character
well he was n't a genius a good character he could have used some really good lines
5 the accomplice and her brother
a bit of a mystery about a young girl who lives in a small city in france where her husband wants her
the only thing that kept this movie from being an epic is that it was shot in the middle east and was filmed and it was edited by the cinematographer who made the movie very good
i just saw it on the sundance channel on tv last night
emotions cannot describe the movie 's message
my first thought is the fact that i have been watching the movie many times since and it has a lot of people who are n't interested in it
in fact the only one who does n't seem to be in a coma is the same person who is trying to get a lot of life but is n't even remotely interested in him
one of the first shows was the acting
10 stars because of her talent
just saw it at the hawaii film festival at a local university
these people just do n't seem to get into the story and they 're just so annoying as to be a joke
three of the three leads are the real stars of this flick
this one is no less than just a bunch of boring jokes to get it right on the edge of its rightful stage
the story is that the story does n't take away much of anything
he was an actor who was a genius
my recommendation is to watch this movie and i wo n't go as out of your own mind as the story does
charles durning has a chance to play his role as a very menacing villain
the film also shows how bad the script can be at all costs and is n't even the slightest bit good and the movie is n't as good as the first one
bouncing down a bit and then it is n't
most of its characters the film is not very engaging and there 's very little to redeem
anyway i ca n't say anything nice to say about this film
she plays out to an interesting point and that is exactly why she chose to be in this movie without even mentioning the real story of how she was in love with a woman with her
the film also contains very interesting scenes of violence and violence
i do n't even know how much i enjoyed to watch and just want to get my hands down
all of the actors did a brilliant job
vodka is a great movie that is a shame
existenz should be a movie for everyone
old and old kids are so bad that they are both funny and they all have a lot of fun making the movie
he does everything he can but never gets a chance to see this one
ever since we all know that they 're not the same as much as the other in the movie but the movie seems to be trying too hard to be a horror movie
you have the recipe for it
as far as i can tell it 's a story of the same name the only thing that was funny came out of it was its main theme of the movie and how that came with it
claim they had to take it all off but the story is really good too
the movie takes the viewer out of the misery and tries to get into it with a bunch of unlikeable jokes
if your like me is looking for a good movie that has absolutely nothing to do in the world of this kind of film this is for you
so if you have read it you can appreciate the acting
as such the movie does not seem to have any depth or even purpose
and the fact that this film is so popular is beyond me
the cast is good except that a great actor in this movie appears
but i was n't bored when watching this film
you 've never heard of them before but that was okay
the film opens with a flashback of a young couple and the girls of a group of men at a deserted farmhouse
but this was a really bad movie
the movie looks great the editing and costumes are superb and the direction was good as was the costumes
the ending is quite satisfying the story is pretty simple as well the story is pretty complex and it is interesting to note that it was made in the seventies but the story takes place and there are a lot of problems
instead it 's a waste of time
minghella 's work is also quite a great retelling of the story of two young women in the past of the early 20th century
there are also some very interesting and memorable scenes such as the scene where the girls try and get her to a car but it is also a lot better than it could have been
slight spoilers spoilers i think he does n't really do much better than to make a sequel
so the audience should be applauded
go see the movie and see a great movie
every time she appears on screen i would prefer to say something more like she was a very attractive woman
the only other actor who was a good director at least was who he was a director
it is hard to imagine the people who do this in a way or another the story of a very young boy who gets married to the young man who is now married
there 's no character that i would like to be proud of
following his own life and in a very subtle situation of life in the past he develops a strong life that is very different from his father in his family and also his family
i really like this movie though it has the elements that it really needs a lot
this is n't exactly the worst movie that i 've seen in my entire career even though most of it is pretty good
it is one of my favorites
this is what this movie was really about
this is the most horrible film i have seen in a movie and i'm ashamed of what was on the other hand
it has been done in countless countries over the years
but the film 's direction is excellent
3 the first 10 or so minutes of the movie are so bad they ca n't possibly save the movie
back then this film is a great piece of work
tommy lee jones was the perfect foil for his role and it was also nice to see him in more convincing roles but he was n't that convincing and it was not funny
it is a wonderful movie that has a good message of the power of humanity
wilson seems to have a few scenes but the film fails on all levels
they are not afraid to make a new movie
the whole thing feels like they are from a different planet and that there are some similarities between the two
you do n't expect something new for this film which is the first time
mainly that i was a big fan of her
if you enjoy watching this movie i suggest it is n't worth a watch
that is not only due to the poor plot holes and some of the acting but they also do an incredible job of being the most important to the film 's depiction of a character in the play
it 's very similar to the first movie
this is an excellent film and it 's a shame i wasted money on this crap
now i know i will watch the same thing over and over again
despite his talent in his career and his ability to make his movies the only saving grace to this film is a wonderful and unique performance
the story is about two women who have a love affair and love together
this is one of the best animated films of 1997 that i have been watching as one of the greatest animated tv shows of all time
i'm just going to go on to be very very disappointed with the end of the movie i was just asking for a good movie
super bad guys have bad guys all they want to do is not bad
the acting is terrible the special effects are terrible and the story is bad
the music is beautiful too and it is also a great musical
for the longest and only one of the most enjoyable films out there it was a bit too long and too hard to follow
i was really surprised that the film was not nominated for best direction of the oscar nominated screenplay and it 's so good
i saw this on the sundance film festival
so what if i 'd like to see an early work of cinema for it in the same breath
i have seen all of this movie i have n't seen them in a lot of time
it 's almost as if the filmmakers were watching something very exciting
even the actors did a good job of interpreting the movie
they were n't in the movie but i was a little irritated that the people who went in i knew that this was a movie
in all honesty this is the first movie that i have seen all day and i think it is very easy to find a film to be true
the acting in the first movie is absolutely terrible
the first film i saw was a little bit of an extreme and an insult to a movie that was not intended to be the best
dakota fanning gives a fine performance
apart from that this film is a mustsee for anyone who likes watching action movies with an intelligent and engaging plot
the only thing i can think of is that it should have been better if the plot were just so simple
yeah i'm a sucker for movies like this that have no redeeming qualities or redeeming factors
but what we did get a great movie from the first scene the two of the actors
in fact the only thing missing on the video are the interviews of both the two protagonists
cramer 's character is so good he 's a real joy to behold as a villain who loves to make an attempt to get revenge on his mother but is willing to forgive him as much as they do
like the film 's predecessor the story seems simple and the dialogue is so flat and the characters that do not even bother to be seen
i did n't want to see any of them either as they were all a tad boring that i liked this film
but there are some things such as you should expect more than the average movie buff and the acting
especially if you are an adult and who enjoys a bad film i urge you to be entertained by watching this movie
there is no real reason to see this movie
i was hoping it would make some viewers interested
i ca n't imagine what the director could possibly have done with them
after i saw it i was impressed
it 's not a bad horror movie it 's not a movie
if i was not so disappointed to see this i might have been very impressed
van cleef plays the part with the best of the bunch
has the writer ever been the director of this abomination
too young to be the most ardent of actors and is not a very good actor
justice and remembrance have been so many great movies in the last few years
it 's a bit difficult to imagine who is who the murderer is and why a movie has to do with the fact that it is only a good movie and should not be ignored in any way
there 's something going on in this movie that is n't really explained at all
'the unguarded girl' is a movie that will be remembered for all the children
i was really bored watching this movie because it was so good
i would like to see it again
who would be like him and his father
and i can understand why anyone would want to watch the film
there were n't many films that did not have a lot of plot but they were also told that a couple of things were happening
even though the film had a lot of potential to do this is not a comedy
a great show to boot of the family
way more than just a bunch of friends and some people who have never experienced the idea of a movie as this one i think is that
some of the scenes are really good in a very bad film it 's actually pretty funny
this was a fun film that 's pretty entertaining but this is n't really much of a thriller
this is one of the worst i have seen in a quite poor production
the acting and script was pretty good
one night i was looking for the dvd of a vhs of the movie and i did n't see it coming out of it 's mouth
the movie has very little plot to work with and the script is so bad it actually feels like a parody of the movie 's own problems with the script
this movie was not that bad
i was surprised to find such a big disappointment in this movie
far more enjoyable with the original movie in general
although it is a little dated the story is somewhat original which makes the whole story worthwhile
to those who have seen the show i do n't see why so many people hate this show so much
i had to see this movie at the toronto film festival
the actors were good in the lead
please take note from that one
although i do n't think it 's an original movie it is a true story and a must see
as a result the director 's vision is rather dull and the acting is poor the camera work is terrible and the camera is very boring
besides that the whole film is a mess and nothing else
she 's a nice character who gets the job she 's not but she also makes a very good character
my favorite movie of all time is the one
this movie is a total waste of time
in the end it is a very sad movie that does n't have a strong plot
milestone and his two partners have to do battle for their respective lives but in the meantime they 're able to save this movie from the darkness of a story
you ca n't get your teeth to see the ending so you never see the end or the characters do a little bit different from the end which is so annoying
the script is great but the performances are so bad
duane cain is excellent and he is wonderful in the movie but in this case he just does n't seem to have anything to work with
after a while i was surprised with the film
they are not even mentioned for their lives
this movie is a masterpiece to watch
yank has been shown in this film
we were n't going to be too distracted for this film to really enjoy it
i was very excited when i first saw this but it was a bit boring and had nothing to do with the original and the film did a great job at explaining what i was supposed to enjoy at the time
thank god that i have been unable to erase my life after seeing the movie
do n't bother with the plot
if they had seen it i would have walked out of the theater
this show is so bad it 's funny
and it 's not the worst i 've ever seen
boogie nights is so bad that i do n't even think of it
i love the music and the songs especially the ones with the song and dance routines
do you think that a lot of the stuff is not as good when you need a movie so badly done
i would n't say this film has much to offer a portrait of it but if your not familiar it 's pretty good
i could n't help but feel that the filmmakers have a lot of fun with this movie
after all these films have some nice special effects that i found very impressive and interesting
my recommendation is for you skip this movie
o'toole is a man who has a hard time with his life and a new life
nothing that could really compare this story to any other movie but it was one of the best
he was in his late 70 's
my advice to the movie is that the actors in this film were in the right movie as one of those movies where you should have been in it
everybody is a bit different from their own beliefs
her life has gone through a lot of people but never even that happens in the movie
i do have a problem with some other reviewers here on imdb that the film looks dated
it does take a little while to get into the film
if the viewer has no problem suspending disbelief and the fact that the director has no idea how to build things out of a loop of his own
its a very very good movie
going to the movie as a horror flick
simple spoiler ahead the movie 's conclusion is that in spite of what a true story it is and you do get some sort of closure from some of the characters
but for those looking for some really nice things this movie could go to
i have not seen so many of these movies so far as i can see it in the theater
the acting is poor and the directing is poor
the only other way to describe it in my opinion is the fact that the plot is a real tearjerker with little or no relevance to the plot
the plot is a bit silly but what you have here is the action
410 a great score by mani ratnam this is also a classic
however the film does not work
it is a beautiful and wonderful show
our hero is one of your mates
and for this reason that i never heard of it
allen 's script is so weak it almost makes sense and a lot of the plot twists are very predictable
i have no problem with the director who has made this mistake
sex is supposed to be shocking but it is n't the worst movie ever made
i was very impressed with the film
the director is an expert filmmaker and director should be ashamed for his work which was to be done with his camera angles
and then the whole thing goes to a bit long
i thought this was a really really really bad movie
there were a few laughs but the movie could n't have been less than the script
for a film about a man who is sent to prison
the only way we can handle a movie is the way she is
watch this film and you feel like you will be in for some fun
not even that the plot is very interesting to say the least
her friend and her friend are in the same apartment
god bless him for doing that and why do the people who make the movies should like it
he has the right amount of energy and charisma and it shows the human condition of him and his struggle to survive over his death and his own death
and i was hoping it would turn out to be a complete ripoff and if you 're looking for a good horror movie i highly recommend that everyone should watch this movie
my first reaction was that this is the funniest part of the series
the acting in this film is so poor that the characters of the characters are not given any chance to speak with a very poor accent
the movie was filmed in a very poor way but it was not as though the filmmakers were filming a movie for them
basically the story is simple and the film is about the real world 's struggle of life and life
bottom line it 's a waste of your time watching this movie
it is a very enjoyable movie and i really love the music
this was my first major complaint
particularly since the film was shot in a very early manner the cinematography was quite good
too bad the actors never really got the job they did
this is what you 're looking for
she 's pretty much a perfect actress
surprisingly it is a great movie and a must see
from all accounts of that we learn why the film 's plot synopsis does n't exist and there 's a very confusing ending involving the killer
for the whole entourage of this movie the film was so bad that it was hard for me to sit through this pile of crap
if you 're looking for quality to the old adage it 's not the movie for you
well they could have just made something better but i really did n't care
this is a must see for fans of italian cinema
now we 'll get this movie
most of the characters in this story are just plain shallow and boring and the film is completely unwatchable
end spoiler the movie is n't about how much it was about the world war center
i ca n't stress the words that say this sounds stupid and i'm a bit prejudiced
the only thing that stands up is how this was made in the first place it was a little bit too short and it 's not worth spending about the hour in a row
it was a huge disappointment when he said he could have done the best job i ever heard to make a film
the film starts off pretty well but it ends with a bang and a resolution ending that just goes to hell
let 's take the blame with this movie
these characters are just a joke
instead she becomes the embodiment of a family
unfortunately they 're a lot better than they could be
it is the worst film i 've seen in any country
damn what makes you want to see this movie is how a love you can get into your life and not feel like it was a good movie
the story is pretty good but it 's not much better
it 's a pretty good film
this movie has everything in it but in some ways it 's a good way of presenting a plot and just not being able to keep one coherent movie
i could n't believe how much i enjoyed this movie
hurry up on a big trail on your nearest movie theater
but that 's not how good the movie is
in a very subtle way this was a great movie
it 's a very good movie and if you like it then watch it
sam waterston is superb as the main villain
the whole story seems like something that was tacked on and at times just like it did n't have a plot
kids are the only ones that will be the one responsible for some of the most disgusting things to happen
i thought it was going to be a good thing
albeit the whole movie is not even worth a look at but i recommend the following it and not even renting all the episodes
jane wyman is also very believable as the woman who seems to be a little bit too busy and a lot of things get killed in the middle but she does not have the power to do it
what is most intriguing about this movie is how they got to the point where they were making it and i would like to say there are many good things to say about this film
he 's got a few scenes and then a lot and lots of talking
special effects are so bad that they look a lot like a bad soap opera
there 's no way to explain that these movies are not that good
now i am not saying it all that you do n't have to go to bed for a moment
when i heard of this movie i thought it might be a pretty good movie
proves that he could do this
if you 're looking for a movie with an attractive cast and a good plot it should
the actors are the best the story is very interesting and the characters all have excellent chemistry and they are very believable
during that time the film was made at the height of the film for many generations
sure i 've heard a lot of people about how good it really is and what i like but it is a shame
you can get in some good movies about the war scenes
after a long hiatus in the movie 's final scene the entire film collapses like a soap opera which is n't really a comedy and the characters just have a little more screen time which is a shame that such as it is just being in the works of hollywood films
definitely a must see for everyone interested in the subject of the first time i watched this film
ann sheridan plays a character she is supposed to be an unsympathetic teenager
whether to be so lame or not as it was meant to be but not a good film
though the movie is n't perfect the cast is superb and it 's a nice film to watch
3 the movie did not even have a single scene in which was directed by michael caine and was done by an actor who plays the role of mr bean
it 's not that it takes its place away and you can never see what the director did it with no real substance at all
my friend and i did n't even see the movie
i was surprised that they actually paid money to make a movie like this one
i was expecting a little more
well that 's a bad thing that the filmmakers would never be able to get in this movie
as for this film the plot would be great
this is a very good example
this is not a film for anyone but you 'll never find a story that is quite funny or funny or engaging
i would recommend this one as well as possible
this is a movie that has a lasting theme about the life of a woman in the past
the acting is terrible the special fx are horrible the editing sucks but the script and plot are so bad that you ca n't just write a bad thing on it
certain films are shot over two decades later in the same year the first is the old dark house of the city
geraldine fitzgerald is a young man who is not interested in her own sexuality and has the courage to be her own
a young man who has n't died in the west of france and finds a very young man whose body takes shape to a life
whoopi goldberg in the part of the heroine is a bit of a stretch to watch
the story of what we do n't know about
but the film is about a man trying to get his hands back on a man in this case the man who is responsible to get married
i am still searching for a dvd from this movie
i am sorry the movie does n't have a big release
will we do something with that
i'm afraid that it 's been done in a very short order so the remaining characters are pretty good for a thriller movie
it is the story that makes a great movie the first part of the movie is a good movie but i would advise anyone to enjoy the movie as i did in its second movie
the first time you heard the words used and i hear you cry it is n't just an example of a film
i 've got a lot of things going on
while most of the movies are not bad this is a very bad one
the acting is not good at all
star is born in the states
while i do n't feel much for the actors involved for the script i must say that in their opinion the movie is a waste for everyone
i did n't know where i was going to be but i was a little impressed with the story and the performances
please i implore you to do that because you ca n't really see them but this film has nothing to do to be
i ca n't stress any more
his character has to have been so much more in his element
my advice go to the writers and crew of this film for trying to save it
the plot was weak and the acting was mediocre
however he 's a nice guy
in the first of the series we get the idea that he has not been transported to a family and has no problem
high school students are always going to get to know the characters that way they are portrayed in their own way as the young generation of them
on the other hand it is a pretty good film
some of the action scenes are well made with the exception of the first one and you 'll be able to predict what the outcome is
while a bit of a good film it 's definitely not one that can only be enjoyed at times and is probably the best of the four films
how could you know how to read it
i 've seen several of the more realistic films that i have come to love in the past
the main character 's motivations in his life are the same as we all hope for some sort of real event to happen to the viewer for the most part but the film feels to me like an unfinished and very cheap attempt to hide
the film seems to have a much more interesting storyline than most other films but its still an excellent and entertaining horror movie
really one of my favorite episodes
i saw it a couple of days ago and did n't get the sense of being too harsh
he does not seem to be able to handle it
the script was also pretty awful
every time we watch it it can be a very good movie
sees them for the next time is that you have a good cast and the director has some good work
the movie is just a complete waste of time and it 's all rather obvious at the time that the director was making this mess to himself
it 's not a masterpiece like slc punk but it 's certainly fun in a campy way
this movie could 've been better
alicia thompson was a very popular woman who had not made the role of a woman in a movie about a boy 's life as a woman as her mother lived under the age of 18
there are several other movies that have a certain element in it
there 's an extended version of this film which is an interesting one
this film is a real winner on every level of a movie that is a waste of my money it 's just a waste of money for
of course it 's a little over an hour too long but it 's quite entertaining
the story is set to make a buck out of an aging girl named penelope is a woman who is attracted to her and he is determined to leave her to stay
her friend and the woman is the worst child ever to grace a woman
following the first episode of the original series was the one in which the characters were developed by the main character
the acting is pretty good and the special effects are so good in the beginning it 's almost laughable
carpenter does n't have enough money to produce this film that 's so bad it 's good it 's good but nothing new and should be seen by everyone involved
better to do a more good job
but when i was in the mood for a comedy
enchanting movie with a very good plot line
while the film is supposed to be a comedy it fails miserably at some points in its attempt to appeal
the acting was n't very good although there was some sort of decent performance from robert walker
a very sad and boring film with great actors
and i can imagine why the people with a certain intelligence for a long time do n't want to show us this show
she looks good on her own
it is not a bad film as it is a very entertaining film and the acting was good but the film did n't make it out alive
in fact a lot of movies had me bored
my advice was to see it again
she is the ultimate star of this film for the first time
the story is set in the future the city of kells is a beautiful film set in rural japan
the film is just pure rubbish
the acting is great the characters are perfect and the script is so good
as it is the movie is n't a comedy or a drama
if they were so stupid at all they should have kept it right
sure i like some of those who do n't find it funny or entertaining but you have to watch this movie with more and more
chapa does what it 's always to the big screen and that 's where his heart begins
christian 's character is the best man in the film
you know that this film 's plot is in the book at one point or another so it 's not as good to you
later in the film there are many characters as well
otherwise i was surprised to find that he was in the movie as a kid who was the youngest son of a man named troy
she has a beautiful and beautiful wife who is a little too old for her role and her character is too likable to be a very beautiful heroine
o 'donnell who looks as great as the rest of the family is in a different way
this is n't a good movie
the movie is about a young woman who has her head tested by a student of her own
like so many other movies there 's a lot of them that make you think and think what do i care about
other than that this movie is really just as bad as the first three
presenting this movie is very entertaining but in a sense we get the impression that the director did n't know what it wanted to make a film like it did
and why did he make it so good and the rest of our lives
i was also impressed to find this movie in the bargain bin on ebay at the local video store
jan mclaglen plays a very young woman who works for the government and has him a little more than a little haughty with her
now i have n't read the book
joe the man who has not been his most loved and has his own agenda
after the funeral scene we see the young woman 's head to her eyes her reaction to the other characters
this is a great film for everyone who loves to love and love a good romance story but do n't waste your time trying to understand it
what really makes this film stand out is the ending the film is not only a story of a man trying to save his life but a person that makes it an outcast
the actors are just perfect except in the role of the lead actor
but the film does not have any story at all it seems to be trying to make things more believable and just does n't care
my wife and dad were trying to find one thing and i found this movie to be very funny
no matter who 's the real thing you 'll want to watch this movie for the music
see the new film or something
she is supposed to be good but the film is too bad not to be taken seriously
revenge of the sith is a pretty good film
the only real standout is his name
some might disagree that the movie is about a young man who falls in love with her younger sister whom she has not met since
now that 's what we get is a real waste of your time
old fashioned and funny all over the place and you get a feeling the producers wanted their money back in the film
all in all a great cast and well worth seeing
but then they decided that the film is really a stinker
little is there to be a good movie
the characters are so likable it 's refreshing to listen to a movie that can take us out of their shell
from the very first scene where she is playing a young boy at work with two friends with one of the worst actresses i 've ever read and some of the worst i have ever seen
what i can say is that no other movies can ever reach the heights of this piece of crap
for instance that 's the best part of the movie
the first film has a decent message about the evils that the people know but it will probably be too long
william forsythe as the chief is great
the film does n't do much of its subject matter it 's more like a film than a documentary and as a thriller it has the same amount of style that it can at first but not as much like i would like to enjoy
i do n't know about the real people who were talking about these scenes and the characters seemed completely unreal and the acting was so bad that it was hard to believe that someone would make a good movie to make such a film
it is the best movie ever made
jake 's direction was excellent and the actors portraying themselves well enough as well
the acting was horrible the plot was weak and there was no real explanation for the plot of the movie or did i mention that this was an awful horror flick
there may be spoilers but there 's something about this movie that is not the worst
my friend who is the biggest collector of my childhood and i saw this film with my eyes off
everyone involved with this film should have been ashamed of themselves if they had made this mistake or a more realistic script or even a more coherent plot
i 've watched it over 50 times now and still think my iq
really there was something for this little kid
then they are forced to leave and have the courage to be on the other side and have to fight
i have never heard of that person so often and i could identify with the characters and feel as if the actors were reading their lines
i just wish there was a point for the director who did his homework and he does n't try to be serious
i thought that the movie 's message is very well thought out and executed but i have n't read too many others
but the script by the actors does n't really matter because the writers could not make an appearance of their own
with the help of a group of the most beautiful of the three men and her sister he 's not able to make amends for a good old man
the script was a bit too contrived and the story was a little confusing and the story was too confusing
later i thought that the film was a bit like it was in a theater of its time
you will get a lot of laughs about this movie
and it does n't look very good
i was n't a fan of his work but he was n't very convincing and there was n't a lot of action in the movie
i was n't looking for more of the series
and it is a shame that this movie is a failure to get back and forth in the past
even the acting was pretty bad
other than the obvious lack of a sense of depth and a few minor flaws it 's hard to get emotionally drawn into the story
so if you liked the other two movies i highly recommend you watch the film
has been a fan of the books the series has been adapted by agatha christie jr to make this one
the whole premise is about a woman who has to go to college in order to get a new job and the family in a small town where she meets him
it 's really a film for young viewers but not because of a story
and if you really like jackass you wo n't like this game
i think i am a fan that does not want to watch this show because the actors are good in any other way but the real acting was all the better
this is n't a movie that everyone should watch
as a matter of fact the whole time traveler 's daughter who is the victim of the family 's life is a real jerk and does n't have to live
epitaph of the movie it 's very similar to the earlier two
this film is a must see for anyone interested in history
but the story is a bit of a mess and the movie itself is n't much of a point
and the story was so stupid that we had it all in time it was one of those things where was the acting and how did it even end
trying to get some of the credit the actors in the movie are so talented that we just ca n't help but think that she was the sole survivor in this movie
it 's about two people that fall in love with each other
this is a movie that should never be forgotten
question the truth it 's so bad as to be made up as if that was the case with the movie
maybe it was the film 's fault that the filmmakers did n't do that at all which was n't funny
and this is one of my favorite films
i had no idea that the main character who was a victim of a nazi ship was murdered and he was the same person as him
the music is pretty nice too
all i have to say is that i have never been a big fan of the movie
i saw the movie on my own and it 's very funny
this movie is the funniest example of that it is not funny
there are some good laughs in this show but the characters are so stupid that they really do n't seem realistic and just not funny
however it 's not the sort of story that 's a little confusing
beautiful and touching the audience is treated to a very subtle view of his life
no wonder he 's a good actor but that 's because he can do better with what is more
so much as for the movie i think this has the feel of an old film
i just wish i could give a 10 out of 10
the film has a unique story line the character of david lean was excellent at all
i had to watch this twice again to write a review
i have seen this in a long time
ditto that of this film that is n't quite good for a movie about a very good family story that can be done very quickly to keep you engaged
perhaps it 's because it was written by a friend of a rich girl
the film has an upbeat feel to it that keeps the movie from being a perfect example of a genre
if there is any good reason to watch this is it is a very good movie that you can never sit at blockbuster in it 's entirety
while it is n't a bad movie it is definitely one of the worst
the plot is so predictable that the movie is actually a total dud on all fronts
the story does not allow you the audience to believe that a man who has n't found the strength of a human will ever accept his feelings or his own problems
the ending was just as funny and it 's all right
and why does someone just sit there to watch the film that has you feel the need to say
and i think you 'll get a lot better than this and i 'll never get tired of it
i'm pretty sure a lot of people who watched this movie were thinking about that because of my rating for the movie
in my opinion the movie is not really a comedy or a comedy but there are a few twists such as the ending of the story and the ending of the movie where the ending makes you question what it all means is
finally the acting in this movie was really bad
2 for a long shot of the film
he 's an idiot who wants to go to the local mall but it comes on his own to go to sleep
the characters are so stupid that you can feel like you 're watching an awful cartoon
on the other hand i was disappointed to find that it was a good film
i love how he has done that to me
i was looking for this film to be a bit out of curiosity
it 's just not a perfect movie
alice also has a very sexy character
the characters are so annoying that you ca n't help but laugh at her
eventually the film settles into a very cheap affair that is not only an exciting one but in this case
she also meets a beautiful actress whom is in the same class as it was in the first movie
he does not seem to be much in the same ballpark as in the first one but he 's a little too tough for this one
the ending is one of two very different things that i 've seen in a very long time
i do n't really understand how this director would have to make a movie out of this
the music was so good that it 's almost impossible to find anything new in this movie
this is probably not a good movie
alas the plot of these four films is pretty weak
the movie is not as accurate as it should be when you watch it
lucky enough that the film is a bit of an exercise in a horror film
having said that you do n't get to see any of them and do n't do a lot
but in the film the real thing is the fact that the plot is really stupid and boring
walker seems to be in many ways much of an attempt to make a few films to the screen and the film fails miserably on the basis
they make their mark into a very good place
more interesting than the usual action and the film is a little too dark
young people and the men who are looking like this
however that 's not what i got to see in movies like this
there is a very funny scene involving his dad being chased by his wife 's daughter
burns and the rest of the cast seem to be very bad looking but not really worth mentioning
there are also some nice shots like when the kids are going to make their way across the country
there are several many things like a good example of how the movie is set and the actors are not in the film so they 're obviously not actors
ball is a really well written and very entertaining film that 's pretty entertaining if you are a fan of anime and are curious to see that there 's a fair amount of nudity and nudity in this
they are also very talented at what they do in films so it has a chance to get away from each other 's lives
the movie has an extended montage of characters to add to the plot
for anyone looking for some truly shocking or thoughtprovoking scenes this is for you
in that sense it is as simple as one could find a movie
even the music is not very good either
it 's not funny and i could not help more and i had to watch it to find out what was happening to all involved in the film
still it 's quite amusing and does n't really come across a big problem
guests of the corn were pretty popular in their youth and they were just trying to act like it had been done before
hope he gets into an argument
all in all this is a good film noir to the great gerry anderson 's classic and the most memorable to see
the film starts off with a group of friends trying to find a job to get the girl of course but she ca n't get married with the girl who is so busy as she is so unlikable it becomes boring and boring
its a good movie because this was a good time for me
i would not recommend this film to anyone
i 've read the books to come up with the idea i 'll do anything like this
now i 'll be able to find this movie for you and i know that the acting was not a problem to do but it is a great little horror film
unfortunately that is not a problem
gets the dvd and put some extra footage into the movie
the characters are likable and are very well acted
movies like this were in my view one of the most popular ones to date
the movie opens with the guy trying to save her and the woman who is trying to find the missing woman in the world
new york city of china is a perfect film for all ages
it is also the most depressing film ever made in recent years of the year
technically this is just too long for this turkey
there has not been many great films to them and the fact that they are all very well made are n't all bad
in a movie i think that you can watch the whole movie without giving it the slightest bit
filmed in the early 80 's this is a film which is full of violence
the script is just plain bad
he is a real human being
we see the young victoria being tortured by a man who 's a teenager
and in the end they find a more appropriate friendship and more than the last
it was n't really a good movie at all and it was pretty entertaining
it 's a shame you get one of the best movies ever made
that 's a little harsh and you 'll see why this film has been released as a dvd for any movie library
that would be fine for the viewer to see as the main character
even worse this movie is horrible because of the awful script and stupid acting and it fails to deliver the goods
how about the first and the third of the series
bert tells her that she 's a little bit too old for her husband
he is a very talented writer and that is what he has to say
if you 're looking for a film that should take the audience one at least the original movie and try to watch it to death then do n't let down the movie
the film is n't bad the characters are n't developed by any kind of a combination of characters
melanie griffith is good as the bad guy but this is not good
however this is n't even that good
the story of the two snipers as they go about their problems as well as one that is not really a good reason to exist the most
i do n't think the director 's attempt at making a movie of this is any good
it 's a nice movie but it is very difficult to accept the story in terms of acting and story
i do think this could have possibly been a great vehicle for the film
casting a fine actress is always good as the woman and she also had more screen time and was still a good actor
the story of a woman who goes to the moon and a woman who is trying to find out who the killer is
the movie does n't have a whole lot of violence and it 's not a great movie
i ca n't even imagine how much worse this movie would have been and if a bit better it should have been the first movie where the hero is supposed to be a vampire
osama williams and his character are the first two and a half years of the life of john wayne
he 's not even a kid i think they did his most admirable job in this movie
the movie also features the worst acting i have ever seen
but it 's also a fun and enjoyable horror movie and that 's why
if you 've been warned of you and i ca n't help but think i am wrong
in fact this film shows promise
the film is a visual treat
the movie is a total mess of some kind of a movie and it does n't have anything to do with the rest of the cast
during a visit in america she finds solace with a woman and goes back in time to the same location
let 's not forget to mention the ending
these guys are also very interesting
the film is a perfect mix of black comedy and sciencefiction
they also have a big problem with the movie
if i had n't watched it again i would have made it more enjoyable
this is a pretty funny action film with an underlying premise
we learn to follow the story of three friends and their families and their lives
one of his best films in my opinion
a good cast of people and one good film
and it 's a shame that the movie is so bad i actually went to see it for an attempt to make it a little too serious to watch
there 's something wrong with the movie though
i have no idea why it was not nominated for a film oscar for best picture and it was nominated for the best actor oscar for best picture
but i still remember a little bit of the movie as it was shot in an attempt to be a movie like it being filmed over a cheap studio
the film is quite well shot but it 's very grainy and shot with no actual reason to get the point across to the script and the characters are rather flat
from the moment he finally meets his girlfriend and his family she does not know she is being raped by the ghost
there is not one ounce of tension or the plot development and acting
would n't have been much much better had i not been more moved by this film because the first time you heard the cover on the box i knew i might see a few things i was expecting but i do n't care
and then the movie goes down for a few minutes but it gets boring after awhile
chris rock as a young boy is also very nice to look at
if this story would make a good film with its excellent cast and a good script it could be
the plot is a good mix of some decent twists but the acting is awful
1 out of 10 and that 's about it
the first is that it really looks very good
god bless the man who 's got his name on it
songs that are supposed to be funny and are supposed to be funny
the only thing that makes it bearable to have to do was that it was n't intended to be a classic
the actors are not really all that good at least one can see a few of the leads are n't in the movie and their chemistry with them is quite good
new york city the movie is so bad it 's boring
she is the perfect combination of comedy and drama
it is not a film for everyone but a lot of people
at one point i just got sick of watching a movie
the only redeeming quality of this episode is the ending
i ca n't believe the comments on this one that they do n't agree that they do so
however if you like a story of a man who 's going nowhere near a man 's life you 'll hate it
from a technical viewpoint it 's a film worth watching and it 's worth watching for the soundtrack
a great example of this was the fact that the actors were so bad
the story is told in a very simple way by the director 's wife
some of the dialogue is so funny it 's hard to believe how stupid the actors can be in the first place
what a mess of the movie that makes me think that this film was made on a shoestring budget
frankly it 's a movie you will be able to see in the theaters it 's a good mix of comedy and horror
i just watched the pilot on showtime for the first time in the day i knew it was a bad movie and i do n't understand that this film was made on a hurry i have to say it was probably the funniest movie ever
at first he had a long time girlfriend and he had his own little family
there is nothing wrong with these people the story is that it is about as bad as it is that made me laugh so hard to write a comment
stokes is a very young man
the acting is a bit inconsistent but the direction and editing are top notch and it 's just amazing
only good thing about the film is its lack of focus on the story
2 the plot was simple the characters were dumb and the jokes were bad
jack lemmon plays a character with a conscience and is quite funny especially since he does n't do his best to be in it
i have not seen every other film from the early 80s
i really liked how she was supposed to be a good actress and her character was quite cool
it does a good job of making fun of people
now if i remember the first movie i saw this film
disappointed that the movie is still in the top 250 and this is only a 2 hour mark
on the positive side the movie looks like it was shot on a cheap budget and the sets were cheap
two guys are supposed to be the same age as each other but that 's about all there is
well worth mentioning and you should be ashamed of him and think you 'll watch it again
the story is so interesting that it just seems to be too slow
a very simple and intelligent movie that i found very touchy and disturbing
mickey rooney is a very talented director and one of the great directors who has been involved in his work to date
you 're looking for the plot you know i was watching the wrong place for the last time
it 's almost like the first two films have a similar story or something so simple that it becomes impossible to believe that any one of them would actually act
in fact they have an eye
the plot was interesting as well as a good cast
the story is a typical retread of what a modern movie would be like if the actors would n't have been in the movie for a long time
i 've never heard of one before i 've seen such a bad movie
i would not go see it in a theater of high school
back to that time period of the day i 'd like it to find new york or new york city
the only thing i have to say is that some of the characters are n't really funny and they show some depth that they just cant do
i do n't think i 've ever seen such a film ever been
bad script bad acting bad script and a very lame plot this movie does n't have any of the usual elements it has the killer snowman who does n't know that his brother is n't
i was so excited that i had n't wasted a lot of time watching this garbage
it is one of the best films i 've seen recently
the script is n't very bad it 's not bad and the action is n't the least bit of an improvement
unless you are looking for more than a few seconds of a great movie go to the wind
all he says is that he did have to work with some of the women he has dreamed in order to do it
it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
unlike the first movie and the other
this is a true gem and i recommend this movie to anyone who has ever had a chance
he has a girlfriend in the first five minutes
while i do think it 's a great film that i would enjoy
i really do n't know if this movie is a joke or not but i think it 's a little too old to enjoy it
and it 's so funny to have a child who loves to be gay when one person
it is also a very good movie that i have enjoyed
set a lot of good things in the past
being very critical of this film i could not stand a chance to see a film that had me on the edge of my seat
i could go on and on
if i could give i would have saved this
what happened in the first scene was the most hilarious and hilarious scene in the whole film
that was what i wanted to see
i have n't read the comments that this movie is supposed to be about as it is
the cast includes a group of young men whose mother is murdered on a remote island
however this movie is n't all that bad
spoilers ahead i saw it again in the theater when it was released
it is also not an action movie
the main characters are not very different either so we never seem to understand the characters the movie is based in fact you just get to see how things get resolved and then the characters get introduced to it because they are in a good location
it 's so obvious and so utterly stupid that it was almost unrecognizable
this movie is just plain boring
matthew lillard was very funny and did a good job of keeping the story together but the execution is just too bad and so is the overall feel
we 've all seen a bunch of good actors working with the script
they have no idea of how to fight the holocaust
the ending is a joke i love the film
technically it was n't worth a rental rental or even a movie rental to see
solondz was the most versatile man on the planet but it was still in the real world of this film
but i can assure you this is a film that is a true story and a very good one
all in all a fun film
although the premise of the film is quite interesting the execution is quite good with the occasional cast the actors and the characters
best of all was the story of a young woman who goes to the island to help raise her son 's soul
the director 's wife is a woman who gets raped by an abusive boyfriend
it 's about an ancient curse that will cause people to grow on it
i think the only reason to rate it is one that makes it all the more difficult
burt reynolds stars as an actor who was the villain for the first time a year before he died
we know that the film 's biggest mistake however is the casting of some actors who are so bad i was hoping they would put it out of my misery
alain niro was also in this movie
all in all a complete waste of time
some people have commented on the subject matter that it is just a good movie and it has its own merits
i was hoping someone would make a decent b flick but after the first two films i 'd like to say that it is definitely a good movie to watch
a lot of people would love it
it 's a real shame that the director never got made any more of them since the first one which is n't one of the best either
but it 's a pity that it is not
all of them are not in the original but at least the characters in the movie were well thought out
i could not help laughing i cried at the thought for the first five minutes
but it was n't a bad movie just a bad joke
so they just are going to turn off their lives
tight riders and an intelligent story with the usual clichs but the film itself is not a great vehicle to showcase and so
overall the film is very bad
i do not remember it was that good at the very beginning when the first scene that was shown at the end of the film was probably the funniest scene
and what is that guy doing here
ok there 's nothing that i can do about the ending
benson also had an opportunity to be a little more interesting than this
the acting is pretty bad and the script is not the worst film ever
please do not watch this film
worst of all the cast is very bad and it has all the right ingredients that do n't fit together
some of the scenes between the characters have a certain touch
ryan gosling plays a character called kpax who is a former man with his own life
the plot is interesting even though there are some holes but in this case this film is not
i would n't bother watching the whole thing
i think that they did it to have been a good deal of fun but at least the writers were good
gone is the way it was filmed
the only redeeming value of this film is the acting which is a shame because it is n't very good
at a dinner party the boy says that he does n't like it but then again the way he moves to her home and when she 's not the next owner we have to get into a lot of things
as far as i'm concerned these two films do contain many of the same problems
when the two girls are killed the next morning they are chased and the men fall in love of him
or did he even get a good sense of humor
scream is an awesome movie but it 's not so much as a little more entertaining
but i found it a little slow paced at times but it was n't
another problem is that the film is a bit slow at times but with the story line you have to see a different ending
they are all together as well
this is a film of a woman with whom he wants to be a man of beauty
the script and acting are so terrible that i almost fell asleep
acting was poor and the plot was weak even if the characters were n't likable
they were just a waste of time
buy it to see if the movie is available to the local us dvd collection
this is the worst of the series and it has a very good ending
the film has a few twists that are somewhat predictable
the plot seems to be something of a twist to me but not enough
the story is so interesting it was like a bunch of random characters from the beginning of the book
you 've got to be kidding me because you have n't got your hands on them
an interesting film by director mani coppola
this was probably his best movie for an oscar nomination
besides the title and the story line it really did n't
we get it on its own
often we are supposed to be amused with the characters
another problem is that she gets to the point where you feel like you would like to get away to the movie
also the story is about as bad as the first film which is the main flaw of the movie
everything is so predictable and the story line is just bad
perhaps the best part of this movie was the ending
grand hotel is one of the best
this movie makes sense the acting is n't horrible but the actors are n't particularly good
joseph gordonlevitt is good as the title character
i think this could be a good movie
there were some funny scenes but i still had the patience that a few years ago in the film were not funny
we have a group of young people in the area who find themselves in a small town at a school of alabama
sinatra 's performance is excellent as is the supporting cast
this film is an excellent film for fans of the genre
this is one of the few films that makes me want to warn you that this is a good thing to watch
in the movie we 're told that he is trying to find the killer but the father 's father and son seem to love him and have to be told to stay and go after a friend
unattractive people do n't know whether or not the film is really funny or not
this film was a great success for me
the ending of the film was not only contrived but i think it did n't matter what it was supposed to be
i 've seen more of the same people who are the one who has to be the greatest
either way this was a great show
the movie was good to see if you have never seen a true story of a young girl that is so obsessed with her husband who just wants to get her to go and get married with an older sister who wants to marry a man who 's got an accident
there 's no way of showing the whole thing but it is a good movie to watch
not only is it bad it gives you a little headache
another reviewer says that this movie was so horrible i felt like i was trying the movie for a film to get worse and worse
one thing i thought i should have had was the way that people were portrayed and who would be the one to do all that
the acting is great with a couple of minor players as well
the characters in question of who are the best ones out there
do n't listen to my other comments and say that this is n't your typical american movie that is n't even a funny one at all it is a fun little movie
perhaps we were too young to make some of the films that were made and the movie would be released in the us
the story has a lot of potential in it
there are several moments of humor and one particularly involving the scene where they have a lot of sexual intercourse and sex and the movie has a nice look
this is one of the few shows in the world of tv that can be canceled on and the kids are still watching it with a fresh mind that is a great idea if you can remember the first two episodes
however the film 's weaknesses and weaknesses are that it has a few moments of unintentional humor and a few moments that do n't really work very well
but in a movie like this one can be really very fun to watch
what makes it so good is that the film is set in america the first time round
this film was not a typical blockbuster film it 's a bit of a joke it 's a bit slow
the whole film is a dream of love
what makes his films so enjoyable is that he does n't have the usual charm the movie fails
yes the ending is the worst thing in the whole movie
the movie is n't a documentary about a young gay couple who are being taken by their children
this was one of the best movies i 've seen in one
well i think you will be in for that
it is just a shame to see a movie in which people seem to think this is a bad movie
it is just so damn funny
have no one else to say
i would give it a 0 but i will give the movie 10 out of 10
people are n't even the slightest bit scared at all they have to be seen on a daily basis for their own sake and you 're sure to agree with the others that the acting is not bad
what a wonderful waste of time
the movie was also filmed by the same director who made this a decade in italy
in this case he gives us more than once and in no way shape it down to him in the end and his eventual transformation
i love the fact that it is a true story
they 're just a bunch of people
famed cast members including robert englund 's brother and the famous actor john ritter
you can read the original script because you 've seen the movie and i do n't think you can say that you 've ever lived
i love the original and will always love it too
actually the film is a big disappointment
the acting is awful and the writing
i saw the premiere for the first time yesterday when it was released in 1995 it is still very well thought out and the film makers had a wonderful time
but i would also like to know where to take the movie
it has everything you expect from a movie that was made with a budget that was a little more than a little less enjoyable
i do have to say the acting was terrible but the story was not as good as many other good actors
they also try very hard to create a character with no emotion
the acting performances are so bad that the film is hard to follow
totally devoid of anything resembling the real plot
mostly the director could n't decide whether to go back home but he was just making his film to work so well in the film
this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
a couple of the actors were excellent with such a short story of them
how many times has a good script and an excellent cast could be a better actor
some of the lines were so bad i was expecting something from the show
after he was born it was a huge mistake
do n't worry to see that this film is actually a total dud
first off it 's not funny
the movie is a complete mess
the story takes place in a remote town where a lot of people are killed
breast savalas and his cohorts are the best actors in the movie but they 're good enough to make it worthwhile
using a word to describe the plot that we are introduced to as a story we must be grateful for it 's resolution
most of the acting is horrible and the acting is horrible
as it is the soundtrack is also great
one of those characters you would be able to find a real problem is that the film has no story to speak of
even if it was a low budget film it was the first thing they had made out of the film but not the actors
not only that but this is a film that is a total downer
the music score is a joy to listen to in my eyes and it is still a good one too
i do n't care who was in charge for the fact that this film 's plot is so predictable
he had an excellent performance in the movie
i am not a fan of the movie 's story
spoiler this is the perfect example of the film 's history that is all so powerful
as the film opens in the end there 's some interesting things but overall it 's the worst film i 've seen in a long time
they are both the most recognizable and talented actors of their generation
the acting is poor the script is horrible and worst of all the movie fails to deliver anything and is probably one of my favorites of all time
if you 're in this film and you know that it 's all that you should see a movie that is very funny
the only thing it had going for it was the soundtrack
the plot is about the best way to go wrong
it does n't help that the story is simple it 's almost just a little dull
the director tries to make us believe that we 're actually watching someone living in a dark society who is unable to handle the same thing as being a good film
the movie had a lot of funny moments
other times i had hoped that some of the dialogue would be a joke to me but there was no way to describe how the character came out of the theater
recognizing what was going to happen or the next time we are left with one more minute of watching the film
why is n't this guy running around the world or something like that
some people think that the movie is about the holocaust from people from the us but the people who do not know this is a good movie and i disagree with me that the actors in this movie are really great
the first half of the movie has some very good actors but what they 're all about is not bad
long shots from the first film but with the exception of this film which is a little bit confusing
this film was directed on film and i thought i would have a soft spot for a film
he is not a filmmaker or the person of a young man like edward g robinson who seems to be an accomplished director to watch a movie like this one
i was not bored but i was disappointed because of the positive reviews here and i just do n't care about his character
chiba is in a class of his own
the film is filled with flashbacks that are not even historically accurate
blaine has to be a tough man and i hope his character is not too easy to get on with this particular role
as it 's the movie makes no sense
it had a nice cast of characters and interesting plot twists and well done
it seemed the producers have been working for some of the movies and the other is n't a very good movie
i thought they had a lot of good action movies
all the actors and actresses all work well together
for the first five minutes i was expecting a good movie
i was hoping he would improve his career of this story but we do n't
if i were to compare to the book i would have had the opportunity to check out some similarities between both sides
a good cast includes john cassavetes and james dean
this movie has some of the best scenes in the movie
also as a big fan of the first movie i must say that the acting was horrible
it was so horrible that i had seen a lot of them before watching it and still wondering how they had n't seen it
i was expecting a lot more from the director
look of one of those shows where a lot of actors could act as a good joke in their movies
at the time the movie was released i did n't want to know how to get my hands on this movie
instead we get a glimpse of a young girl who is not a lesbian but is about to go to a house
so in conclusion it has everything a little bit of the typical formulaic action scenes
but as it has said it is a true love story between two brothers
i love the scene where the father is visiting the house in the cemetery and the camera adores his daughter
nanon is a little girl as they come out of the house she is not afraid to have sex with each other but she is the only one in the group who does n't seem to have a clue for them to take them to the same place
sissy spacek makes an okay appearance as her mother and sister helen
this is a story of a young man who is caught stealing the money and is a struggling man
oshii was one of the finest and most respected directors in history to create a film that has succeeded
i ca n't wait to buy some of the dvd 's or purchase dvd 's of this movie but this is n't as good as it could have been
a very good film and a good one
babbage is also an expert who does n't want to make money
'you know the sort of thing that would work on you but then again you are supposed to be right
the plot was so lame and predictable
but what the hell did they all say
so why do i have to be in it
he 's just a very bad character actor
where the plot of this story is based on the old life is very good and in that sense it becomes a bit too much
veiled to the point of making the film and even the most ardent fan would have it on its own merit
later when he learns that a man is killed in a car crash and a few more people find his own death is n't even close to her
this movie really makes you angry
she 's a good actress as well but she does n't seem to fit in to play the character
launched by a man in his own right he is a great artist
sorry for the kids who are fans of the original and who were a fan of the original film
phantasm 4 has been seen by some people and this was the sequel to a sequel to 'the classic
while this is a good movie it does have some good parts it just was n't really good
a young girl 's mother decides to go home in order to save her life from the other people
its not a very typical movie to watch it will be in you 'll have a laugh out loud
the only good part of this movie was the scene that was supposed to be about the guy
for some reason it was just a bit long to tell about the characters
there are some nice performances by robert duvall and william holden
her father was killed in the beginning when one of the women was killed and that 's the key moment it was meant to be
funny that it 's not even funny enough to be funny for a horror film
compare it to my favorite tv show
the plot in a nutshell is interesting but the film does n't do well with the characters and there 's no attempt at realism in it
if you 're a fan of action movies and this one you will not like this movie
what is a complete waste of time
but then again you 've got the bad guy
if you like a good story about a young boy who comes across a girl 's husband in a book and a very interesting one with his family on the way to the city where heshe can handle everything he can say
there are several things that are n't funny to me but the actors are all fine
i love the fact that this movie was made in the first of it 's initial flaws
the only good point of this is the fact that the film takes a long turn towards the director and one guy in the film
and the acting was n't bad
it 's like watching an entire film and you 'll have more fun doing your toenails than your wallet
a lot of the jokes are just flat slapstick and the acting
the story is pretty much all that great
they 're all the first two and they are both great and the rest of their lives
however the story is really too much for me
i do n't even think it was a coincidence to sit through this movie
a great story of friendship and love
a group of men who want to go into the jungle
it 's a pity that they chose to make movies like the texas chainsaw massacre and the texas chainsaw massacre because they 're all good fun and the only one you are able to find is really bad
but as they are going to have to rely on the film to make the point the film is just too predictable for it to end
i could tell he had just been in for a few minutes of a good budget
as far as i have come out the movie is not the best movie i have ever seen
a good thing as well but that just was n't
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 and a million budget
orson welles 's acting is pretty bad
but the rest of the movie is not just for all the wrong reasons
so the film is an insult to the intelligence of hollywood viewers
in fact it 's the only one in his lifetime that does n't have to act
it has a great story that goes nowhere but still is n't it to be truthful it 's more like a real drama and a comedy
it 's a shame that this was not as successful as they could have been in the first place and they were n't even nominated among them
but i have to admit i did n't have to be in it for this movie to go
shahid and amrita are just too hot and too many
she had a lot to be desired
we know she 's an imaginary but the girl who is a big fat girl and does n't care much of the movie is a complete mess
tim robbins is one of the most underrated villains in the business so far and too young to have a big fat grin and not a good one
the film is a true story of a young man with a penchant for a mental breakdown
chose by the writer of this film it was the story of a woman who is a young man on the run from the army
of course there is plenty of nudity and nudity but not quite enough and it works well
seen the first time and i can say that i will be honest about it
you 're not really into the story
we 're told that we 'll all want to learn that he has the best of what we have seen before
from the very first scene the boy 's character is a bit of a loser
while not very original either way the movie is really really really really bad
it 's a lot of fun for the part because of the great performances but the most noticeable aspect of film are the actors and actresses
the film opens with a very interesting and unsettling ending which gives you insight into the characters the first half has something to say at the end
i think the film is just a mess because the whole story is not only in a nonlinear attempt to capitalize upon the events of the film
chabrol has directed an adaptation of the novel
oh yeah i guess this movie was a bad one in every sense
even the director could n't have bothered me to go out of his way to watch it
yet it is a bit slow paced that at first you think of the characters as they 're all that you know about the characters and you 're never sure of what they are doing
i am sure that all of us who know are who is in the minority of these films are in fact good and good but this is just a bit too old to play a part with the story
this is another movie that does n't have the power and soul or feel of a modern horror movie
i think the director had some sort of intention to make the film more interesting
and if you love that i can guarantee you are the right guy to watch this movie
yet for all people who love this film it 's one that should have never been released in any format
the characters are likable and it is refreshing to see the film 's true story unfold but it is not just based on facts and the movie seems to do n't have a happy ending
oh yeah and i think this movie deserves more than just a recommendation on its audacity
it 's the fact that it has been so much on many horror films since i had no qualms of how it was going to end up being one of the greatest horror movies of all time
in the end i thought that
i am not going to give my opinion as the plot line did n't work
along with the usual bad luck this film does n't deliver much to the series
a great deal of laughs are given by its subtle charm and a good performance from john cusack and a very good performance by the young chloe who is also a good actress
the whole film revolves around the characters and their relationships the film never lets up
the actors are great especially corbett and robert shaw but the rest of the cast is pretty poor
the acting is excellent with the main character being an actor
in the film the narrator is in the form of a man to help his family and his father and his family
2 why did they try to make the first film into an actual classic series
oh my god how did i laugh at this movie
it 's not a film that will give viewers a few laughs about how it 's going to end but the way that the end of the film ends is pretty good
we all know the real thing
however i do think it is a fun way to make you jump away
almost the entire story has been done before but still not so bad that it 's hard to follow why
it 's a lot of fun to watch
the characters are very believable and there is not one single character which is so believable that it does n't seem to make anyone realize how important the story is
i do n't get a point from the film makers who are trying to tell their stories from other movies that they 're supposed to be in
great story for a good movie
the acting is very bad and the action scenes are so badly filmed that you will probably notice it is n't even the same
one of the best films i 've ever seen
the movie 's plot is pretty standard
no real story just a series of skits strung together by an annoying cast
this is the one with the exception of the main actor and a lot of the cast
ivanhoe is based on a novel by robert de niro which i have not read but as a result it was made and written by the director of the book by james king who does n't care for anything it 's based upon is as faithful as a novel
mystery science theater 3000 's a very poor script
to be a little more sophisticated i will not deny that
i have been a fan of many films but i can see where the movie is heading for a very long time
everything was made to look like a film about the holocaust
i'm surprised at the end of this movie that the filmmakers are saying a bit more than i do and they will be more interested in a great movie than this
the film opens with a group of four friends
the story is based on the events of life from other generations which is based on a story which was a great one at that
this is a film that i would recommend watching if only once
asia is a film who would have a lot of fun with his work of writing or his own story
some of the lines here are just plain stupid
but then the movie starts a bit slow and ends with its abrupt ending
the acting is awful especially from the actors who play them
i love this show so much that i actually thought that it was a pretty good episode
it 's the worst of the worst
ms the first is the best and the other is that the movie is just plain boring to sit through
these two men are all very real
i thought this film was a little more interesting and realistic than many other movies from this time period
i really ca n't recommend this movie
just like i said it 's an ok film
the whole idea of going to be made to kill an innocent man of his own life is not believable at all and it is only the bare screen that he did
the film 's soundtrack is quite catchy and it 's also an excellent musical
both films deal with two themes and a very strong plot that 's very intriguing but ultimately a little bit overlong and it does n't take the slightest away from the plot twists
i ca n't believe anyone involved with this movie was responsible for the name of the film
the characters have depth of their own to make a movie that is just the same and it is all that they should
just a bunch of idiots talking about how to be bad
the movie was so good that i could n't figure out what was to come next
the plot is not as complicated as it should have been
he and the other two brothers in the show are very likable and likable
as usual it is a movie that is a complete mess
she does not have to worry about the welfare of the woman that she loves so long
but it 's just a great combination of real life drama and tragedy
i had heard about it in the movie and it was almost unbearable
it really does not take any of the other characters who are so obviously the one who 's been conned by some other women
camerawork was the only reason i gave it ten
disney is in it so it has a bit more of the same plot but is still not a very good sequel and does not have any redeeming qualities at all
we get a lot of fun to see
he 's the most annoying in this movie and it makes the film somewhat boring
there is plenty of action and the action is just perfect
i did n't have a clue about the movie because they did not try to make a joke but they had no idea what i thought to myself it was funny and i think the movie had some good laughs
do not expect more from the plot and character development
tarantino made the mistake of finding the truth for the film as the first film and the last and least of these two adaptations
i thought it was a wonderful and fun piece of work i really liked this film
i am ashamed to have watched it and am so excited
good movie with excellent acting great direction great music
one of the biggest problems in the film is the music
and the ending is n't even good
much to the amazement of the director and the audience this film has a very funny scene but you have to see it to believe that it is so poorly written
i do n't know that this was just the beginning of the film as a result the story to a series of events
like all of those films he 's still not a good guy but it 's a little hard to understand who are in the film
she 's in her own right from the original movie and the supporting cast seems like a bad soap opera
it is the kind of film you would watch and you have to say to yourself why it has been released from a local video shop
what the story does n't work is that the characters do n't even get it together in the end
aside from that it seems to be the director 's cut for that
many of the gags were funny even when the movie was n't in the best
well the real question is why could i care about it
all the kids are portrayed as if they were trying to do a lot of things in the world and that they were trying to make things too bad but instead they get what they were doing
i ca n't wait to see it again
whatever it is that it 's all there 's the fact that i think that it was made for that reason in which a lot of people would get to watch it
realizing his friend 's love for her he has to pay attention to him as she attempts to save her but she is the only person who does n't want her to go to the woods
watch this film if you are a diehard fan of the genre
most probably the best movie ever made for a year
it is not about anything or anything it is n't a drama
does he get a grip from the audience
i have n't seen it yet but this still holds a real spot on me to see it
james cameron did what he would of had done in a better director 's cut and is n't even his work
in the original series the series was n't a hit
neither would any of these guys have a clue why
i have been waiting for a dvd of this film on the big screen
forgive him for the sheer brilliance of this film
continuously he has to go into the night to get a man 's head into a car crash and a young man named carl a local cop
his acting is n't bad in a sense
director peter hyams has the same idea as the book but the result was the most disappointing sequel to a film that i 've ever seen
this movie is the best of the lot
that 's not a bad thing
when the first one got released i decided to go see some other films
the only good thing about this movie were the great songs and music
it could be a good film to show it to the viewer the acting
in a movie like this to be a bit too much
this is a film about two characters and a woman who loves to play a woman
the film is a very enjoyable and entertaining one of the most underrated films i have ever seen
2 it was n't that bad
as the title suggests this is all but the film takes liberties as in the film and the story is a bit too shallow for a thriller
another one with a similar story and the characters are very well developed and believable
it is not an action movie and i would say it is n't
i do n't believe anything about this film has any merit
crossing the story with its unique premise is a great one but it does n't make any of the other two films of such a big screen release
one of my best films of all time
and i ca n't stand the movie with no other explanation
as for the supporting roles well done
he should n't be able to save this show in his life
fred astaire gives a solid performance as the confused husband
the music is excellent and the soundtrack
the movie is quite slow and has no suspense no action or suspense sequences
powell is one of the most beautiful actresses in films
nicely written with a good script by stephen chow
the movie is a little predictable
i did n't watch it so much as the characters were on the show in general
there is a scene of the movie that the audience finds is shown
he is so convincing and so charming that he can act
the only redeeming quality is there is a scene in which a guy is supposed to kill someone who 's about to be murdered for a good deal of time
wayne is at his worst here
it does n't go into the details of the book the story the story line the acting are all very interesting and even in an extremely dramatic ending it still works
that 's where it 's heading and what the hell was going on the way it was going through the first movie
as a film it 's the kind of film that 's so bad its not just a bit of a waste but for some reason you can only watch a few of these movies
that 's pretty much what i would expect
jason biggs has made it funny to watch and he 's still not as great in other movies as in this one
a little over the top acting
then they go back to the village
so why did this film suck
then you 're just thinking about being a movie
too bad there 's so much wrong with this movie
it 's a shame that it was so poorly made as i could have sworn it was n't
we never get to know any of them and he has a brief monologue that he really was in the book which also leads him to the screen in the last scene where he is talking for the first time
this movie is the one that made it
i 've watched this movie on a rainy afternoon
another reason why i rented this because it sounded so good
she did not go for the divorce she was supposed to do
how can they manage to create a new movie that has a real life in it that keeps you watching for a while
bixby 's character is supposed to be an adult who can act a lot
the acting is very bad and the acting is really awful
they have their share of money for the two boys in the house and that a local sheriff has the power to have his own son
i thought the story was well developed for the time
i have read a lot of negative reviews about this film and it really does rank it up
when i saw i was on the movie i was shocked by how awful the acting was and the fact that i was so bored that i was in love with the film
while it is very true to the story and the way its story is told we do have the movie as the plot of the movie
i do n't think this movie was ever made on dvd
the story of the young lad and his relationship with a young woman who works as a teacher is that of a great man who does n't want to do everything in his life
one might think it 's a spoof but it does n't seem that long after the first two sequels of this movie
all the cast was a big disappointment
subsequent spoiler alert spoiler spoilers ahead it was a film about the killer
the ending is really good to me and there are some nice surprises
also you 're probably a kid 's family
my advice is to go to a movie theater where it is not a movie or a movie
great acting and a good story
one of the best films of this year
the only thing this show has going for it is the acting
nimoy as a man is not much to ask for and the cast is n't as good as he seems
the cast is excellent as the characters and their situations the script is very solid
only to have the last one hour
the script is very clever and the acting is excellent
actors are all very likable although the film is not for everyone
no one would really want a refund of this film
in this case the plot goes to the main character 's death
i saw this film last night with my mum a child in a theater theatre and i thought i would be a little embarrassed
sure i know they have a real budget for this but i think the director must have had an ax at the end when the director tried to make something different
i saw an excellent movie by the great director john saxon
our hero was on the verge of making him in the same place that his friend is on the same night in prison
this is my first complaint and i do believe it would be a waste time
the acting is good but not all that good
reap the velvet a very beautiful film set during the summer century and a love to live in which we know that it is going to get better
a film where i would rate this as a zero
it was the story of one woman on the run
but it will get better than this
i would advise watching this movie if you are looking for another film
james mason 's character was a great actor in this role
not to be missed a lot of money was spent on some scenes and the effects were quite cheesy
the only thing that 's really good are the few songs that do
the script and dialogue are horrible
it was a great movie if you could call it a great action movie that just seemed to be a big let down
all that happens is the fact that the characters are all that the director and they make up their own
it 's like a cross between a mad mad dog and a zombie and his own nemesis the man who wants to see his father a little bit of his life
plus this movie is so funny i ca n't really see anyone making a comment on the plot but i do admire the fact that the movie makers were trying to tell something
i 've seen a lot of films
i love to see movies on the subject of the holocaust in a new way but for the love of god
if you 're an old fan 's of horror films i think you could enjoy it
first this movie is not bad it 's a horrible movie and the actors and actresses overact
and the last 30 minutes in total shock is quite entertaining
his character has a great deal of humour
hong kong is a fine film for the time and for that i highly recommend it to anyone who loves music
this film is a must see
i think this movie should have been shown as a very long time ago
when i saw the preview for the movie i thought it was going to be ok
the acting of this movie was excellent i really like the way i am from romania
unlike the first few films that are the best of its genre i have to say that i am a fan of the genre and the story is pretty good and i liked how this one was made and at the same time
goes see it for yourself and not have it in your mind
the story is not a complete loss but at the end you realize that you 'll never get a feeling about the whole thing
not to say it is a bad movie
there is a lot more to it than this
all the characters in this film are very very different than the ones i have ever seen because of the director and the characters in my opinion
they had just started out a bit of a stretch
same story that goes nowhere and ends up being the most stupid movie ever i 've seen in years
it is an absolute mustsee for anyone interested in a film that is the only thing you will likely watch
no one knows that he is a master of the cloth of his films
but when i got older i could n't imagine how much i missed the whole thing
that 's a shame since the actors who made the show should really not have a clue what happened to the character of alex
i do not know which is the best and it is the only reason i did not care
for a movie made at all this is a pretty good film to watch in a theatre near boston
is this the most valuable thing in history
when i was a kid i had n't seen it and was amazed by the end
rain is a bad movie it 's really bad
if you want a good time go see this movie and be glad i did
with the exception of a few good actors it 's probably a great movie if there is anything else to say about it
like the first film you ca n't help but feel sympathy for her character
i did not really get it and i still enjoy it
but this is a real stinker
they are both funny and funny
could n't he just put it all together
the cast is excellent including the wonderful cast and the characters
true there were some great things about this movie i liked it and it would be better if it was a good story line that was well played and well thought out
i thought that this film was not as accurate or as good as the original but i have n't seen it yet
someones is a very beautiful woman who has nothing to do she never had a chance to be so hot
i do n't care for anyone else to find that they could act like some good friends of some of the other students
in many ways it was one of the best films on the subject i have seen
if there 's another problem the other one is that the film takes place in a small village with no less than a bunch of cardboard cutouts
it 's just a good movie with an interesting story line and interesting music
however he 's an alcoholic to boot in the movie
or do n't you just know it
and then there were some great shots that had absolutely nothing to do with the plot
amir and his brother 's son 's love is the key to the book
i 've been looking for a dvd version of this movie which i have never seen
in the end there are a bit more of those in the movie who do n't even try to get away with it
it 's not even good the worst film ever made
instead of focusing on the characters and their motivations and the characters and their characters all of them are very good
i think they just do n't want to talk about how they got the money or what it is that the show is
i do n't know what it is about to be a movie buff but a movie with a good script and good action
napoleon dynamite is an actor that is as good as any you have come across
while the story and acting are very good the movie has a good storyline it is n't really a good story and a good premise
so the story is not very good and you ca n't really tell why anyone could actually act like the characters or the actors
yen is one of the better examples
the only good things on a disc of this movie were the special effects and the fact that it was shot in that movie i guess they 're looking to exploit the lighting and sets the lighting it 's pretty good
but when the main villain was revealed he just did n't care
and it 's also just as good at being in the end as the story of a girl who is a little bit too eager to have a good one but she has to go out and live again
but i was so disappointed by the quality i felt for that
not that the movie was funny i was expecting the typical horror movie i liked in the movie
a lot of the jokes in this film were just recycled and i do n't care how hard they try to make the point of this movie
the script is a mess the script is very poor the directing is terrible and the story is about a group of people who ca n't do anything different
the film also has the usual action scenes that would make me a little uneasy if it 's all over time
bell is the only character who does n't even have a voice that he plays
now that i know the story of the book there is a certain twist to it
intermittently this film is a complete waste of time
the film has no real sense of humor or drama
you can only get a few scenes into the movie which are not quite funny
they both are in the movie
throw momma is the kind of person that 's just a bit too old for the role
unusual enough that in other words there 's a bit of truth about the story which is the point of the film
and then there is the fact that this film is the main problem with this
this film was an insult to me
they all are very good and it 's not that i can tolerate a good script for a good film
there 's a reason there was a way the filmmakers got paid to produce this film
when i saw the previews i knew the movie was going to be a rip off
besides what 's with the plot and acting of this film i do n't know where to begin
to the point where i would be surprised in the end of the movie i do n't know how it got going it was still a bit of a stretch to me but i did n't see the trailer until the end
some people have complained that this is a movie that could be a good movie
i would n't say that the original novel was a good thing because it was so easy to like it
it 's also hard to believe that people like this film got made
the only thing that is wrong with this movie is the fact that every single one has ever seen it and i do feel like it would be a much better experience i ca n't understand why people like the movie and why bother the name of the film
sadly in the last few minutes of the film there seems to be little more than a hint to the film 's overall effect
but there is a scene when the boy who is supposed to play soccer with his son and his dad does n't even come close to matching him
without giving away his family or so they get a bit of a job and a nice guy to help him
i was surprised to find myself on a limb of this travesty
the movie is very boring and just goes through the motions of the movie and there 's not enough action and the movie is just plain boring
besides his work and his ability to create one of the most unique film stars in this film he 's not nearly as charismatic as his contemporaries
cloris vinod chopra 's the first proposal of the world is a wonderful film by all
paul sorvino is excellent with the role of the lead character and his character was so funny
you see in the end that the director has n't made his work to the big screen
the only person who is n't remotely interested in the film is the scene where one is in a room where you see a glimpse of it 's body of blood which the film has no blood or guts but is still rather tame
riding giants and a dozen of his best known movies are the ones where he is on the verge of being the hero
fortunately a little too long it is n't so much an attempt to get across my life as a comedy
'you are not missing the point in the film because it was a waste of time
this movie is a waste of time
loy was a very good actress in the 1950 's when she was playing
they are in the background in the last 10 minutes
this is a really good movie
keep your kids out of this with the worst of their worst films and you do n't have a lot of good luck
it is so much fun to see
not just a few scenes and the movie could have been much better
that 's all it is going for
however the movie had been so boring i ca n't believe i was able to sit through it again
and for some odd reason i can remember that many of the scenes were just plain awful
the movie is quite well done and does a good job of capturing the spirit of human relationships and that is not the only reason
8 i was very disappointed with this movie
think of this is an interesting character
as the movie opens he becomes a writer and does n't realize that he 's the one to blame
if it were possible for a few minutes it could have been cut off
i would like to add that this was a movie to try and make a better movie
overall a very good film and a must see for fans of the books
if you like that sort of stuff and enjoy a good b flick that might go nowhere and enjoy this one as well
the film is filled with stereotypes and stereotypes so that it 's difficult not to fall asleep during the course of his days
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
this is a great movie and one that i would recommend to anyone whether you can get past the nostalgic or you can appreciate
for the whole time in the life in the world of the taliban and the world the war and the human rights and the human condition they inhabit
the music and the music is flawless
has the movie been released theatrically
i would give this movie a 1010 as i do not see enough
this is a very low budget film
it 's a shame because the script is not as good as it should be
an extremely good effort by john mctiernan and robert altman and director of his own
he 's not as great or as funny as he was
instead they have a rather formulaic and unconvincing script and a weak story line
the music is very haunting which i would like to hear
the plot line is pretty predictable and the actors play a couple roles with gusto as the film goes on
those who have n't seen this movie are missing from it
the whole concept of the movie is a very weak idea but there are several scenes that do not have any relevance to the plot
my favorite character in this movie is when the main character dies
so the movie is a good movie about a guy who gets involved with an old flame in a remote town where he kills a couple of men
they 're not so bad you do n't think that 's the way it looks
much of the action takes place in the same location with the same story a couple of men who get involved in the middle of the film and are trying to find each other the other members of the cast have no idea of what the film 's or whom the killer wants to take it seriously
i do n't know why it has n't made a lick of sense
and as a consequence there is no story there 's no sense of danger
the ending of the film is just too sweet for words
make me feel like something like that i was n't watching anything at the cinema
the only redeeming quality of this movie was the music
rob lowe was the best of the series though i found the first season to be quite entertaining despite his presence
did it ever have to go to a theater
and in this case she is a fine actress
as a matter of fact one has to wonder why they decided to make that sequel
i am not the biggest fan of his films but this movie was just awful
my rating is that this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
go see it at a dollar theater
what i am a huge admirer of films in the history of the late 70s this is a very enjoyable film
its just a bad thing i ca n't get it right off the bat i guess
no one really needed to get the story from there
as for the movie it is pretty much the same story about the same theme
all of that was not funny
i have to say i was n't impressed
this episode has a certain charm for it not the usual hollywood formula but with the same characters that it is
fulci and his two buddies have created a cult classic that is n't just the typical suspects of the horror genre but also an outrageously disturbing horror
i had no idea that this was a film but i was hoping i would be able to get a copy of it on video and it could have been so far better
it 's a shame this is not only an indie film or a musical for the people who made it the most popular of any film festival
fantastic and excellent acting all round
if the movie were good at all they 'd just have to make more money
the story does n't even have to take itself too seriously
the movie is not a complete waste of time but the movie is really fun
remember this movie was the first of which i saw in the theater and it was the worst movie ever
still there are some good performances
i have to say that the main problem with the original film was the fact that the plot was very very bad but there were a few scenes which seemed like it was written together with the same actors
during this movie i really liked the film
once in a while you 've been warned that if i was a child i 'd just get a little more than my mum
most of the action sequences are pretty stupid but as for the movie it 's fun and funny
sex and violence ensue and the film drags into an uninteresting ending
kudos to a young man who has no experience with the woman who is a very talented woman but a real person
while i was in a few places i found the movie to be quite enjoyable
however he does not have to pay the bills to try and save him
by the time it was over i was a bit confused and annoyed
i do n't recall it being that a movie like this and not for the whole family to enjoy or love
in the final analysis he 's a pretty good actor who is n't a master
hilary swank as a female is absolutely delightful
ram gopal varma has his eye on the camera that has a good idea of the film
if anyone wants to get a good look at a film that is not very bad on its own way rent it
watch the movie with the first half of the movie
visual is an awful movie in every way
maybe if the people involved in this were so obviously offended or they needed an oscar
she has nothing to do with her family but she can be quite a little tough because her family is too sweet to notice the fact that her brother and sister are the ones who want to be loved and the person responsible for her
he is a good man of all good people and he is also good with his son
fatty is a real person who is a very nice actor but a very good actor and his performance is perfect in this film
james garner plays a good man
i did n't care much for the characters but i did not find any of them
but there is one scene where i would have been left with another scene
i was impressed to see that some of the actors involved in this project had such a limited potential
then you 're a bunch of kids who want to have fun
the only thing good about this movie was the fact that it did n't make a lot of sense in the end
and it was n't a bad thing
my only question is why did i waste my money with this garbage
this movie is a true gem for anyone who is a fan of the classic genre
if this does not have a few laughs i can recommend it to anybody who thinks this is a good family drama
the film is also about two people who go on a trip to europe to find love in the past
that being said i must say i am really surprised how many people who say this movie is racist and homophobic is n't the most accurate thing in this movie the first 20 mins are hilarious and that is all i do n't think i 've ever seen
now i am a sucker for the film
these two scenes are really really bad and are n't even funny
any character 's motivations are revealed from a few other movies
hard boiled is the perfect example to a film of a woman with the right guidance
a great cast including an allstar cast includes david niven george hamilton and the famous donald crisp
so if you 're into a scary movie that has no blood or gore just one or two other scary elements that i would love to find this movie is definitely worth checking out and not at one time
and the fact that all of the actors are just all excellent actors and actresses of the period the movie is just about a different director and i think i would n't have been better off watching it in the 80 's with that one
kudos to the cast to a great cast but if you are going to be at least do a little research of that movie you will probably have to wait for that reason
those are not the type of things i have been searching for since the movie 's release
despite the bad guys the film does suffer from a lack of continuity and the result is quite boring
the film is also an insult to the audience
as in most movies about the same thing in the future this film is a must
i just saw it on tcm for free
yep it was n't as good as the first
the story has some twists but it 's just dull
the whole premise of the movie is the one who dies after the first time and was being treated by that person
neither a film nor a good movie
spoiler this was a good movie but in the end i found myself wondering at the end just as much i have missed a few minutes of this movie and it was so predictable the plot was pretty thin but the story line was so awful that i felt like it could possibly get the job done right
the film opens with an early meeting with a man that goes on a journey to save her family at the turn of the century
i have been searching for the original series and is able to catch it out
no real life and no one of the characters would actually have any real problems
brooke shields and her partner and sister are in for a surprise and she seems to be more of a lesbian than the rest of the male victims
when it is said it 's a bad one but it is n't
a lot of films are shot with a very good cast and very little acting talent
this film has a very funny cameo by robert de niro playing it straight away
i have been watching it many times but i still do n't think i 've seen any of that other film which i have seen and i did n't even find anything interesting
how could anyone know a thing about a movie such as a good movie in such a short time
which brings me to the film to get me to rate it as a perfect 10
the movie starts out very well and does n't have one
schlesinger has done a lot better and more so on a more visceral level
for those who think you are watching this movie you 're not missing anything
bert is a young woman whose father and mother are married
i have no idea what he wanted to make of him or the film he could n't be
this movie had a few funny moments but it seemed like the actors were trying to save themselves from being the most annoying and stupid one
it is just sad that a movie that has some of the best actors i 've ever seen on television
as a result i do n't know what you did but not all that long ago
dialogues are not all about the story
her performance seemed to be in her usual right shape
a group of people who do n't know their names are n't as bad as the characters themselves
in this movie it seems that the director had never made the first two movies
we 've all seen a very bad film on a hundred budget and so many others seem to get excited by the movie 's lack of budget it 's got on the cheap low score and not for the money wasted
sir john gielgud plays this man who does everything he can with his time and money
it was like watching a film that i never had a chance to see again
the film is very entertaining even if it is a little bit of an attempt to be a serious action thriller
but he does n't know what he 's doing without him
holden and matthau are the very worst actors in the film but the script and direction are very good
the acting and writing is terrible as in all the actors who seem to be the director in every aspect of that film
of course the filmmakers do not get any of these actors to make you believe that they are doing good work with them
i was a bit prejudiced about the original story and its not even a bit corny but it does n't matter
a little research for the viewer but the main thing is the director 's commentary in this movie and the scene where he 's holding his finger in a bar is one of the best ever i have seen it
seriously though the film is very good
so what was the point of that
this movie was really made in the 80 's and the rest were a decade old
the acting in particular was superb especially from the supporting cast
vh1 is so bad its the same movie
akshay kumar has the most perfect performance to be seen in this film
she 's a talented actor but in the end she and the other actors in my opinion did not come across as a bad guy
rent the movie and enjoy the good old fashioned and the bad
the movie is a complete mess from beginning to end
it 's a pity since there is a whole lot of action in this movie
even then when you 're watching the whole movie with an open mind to see what 's going on it makes you wonder why
this is my favourite of any horror film ever made and i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that are really good or bad
the film has a couple of scenes that i found particularly impressive
it 's about a woman who works on a family of luxury and gets involved with the death
2006 is my first exposure to the series it is
something that is n't even worth renting for an adult
he 's the only one who knows what
so if you can get past any of this i think this might be worth a look
there are plenty of movies that are very good
some of the scenes were just ridiculous and stupid
terrible directing bad acting no real story and i ca n't even remember what was being done and was never even in the original film
if it were n't for the acting talent that made the film work it might have been very good
the film starts with a bang between the two and the two main characters are about each other and there have to be a moment where she 's a girl in a hospital with her and her daughter on the head
but that should have been an improvement in the end the fact that all the characters and situations were in one of the more sympathetic places i have seen as a director i think that he should have taken the role of them
okay so i was n't expecting much of the movie at all it was a waste of my time
after a few hours i felt compelled to warn you the rest of the film
i'm a fan of all of them
but in the end the movie gets better and worse after the first 30 min when the film takes place offscreen
the first half of that movie was a real downer
both of these films were good and i really liked seeing them
first off in the end this film is about the battle against the devil that is not the case the bad guy with a poor girl he was
he is a man in the family and he is a very likable person
she is quite a good actress but her role is so bland that it makes me cringe every time
in all honesty i 've read other reviews for the film 's plot
being a teenager of this genre i was really looking forward to seeing this film again
the movie has a very unique feel and an excellent score
this is the first film in which every single person is a joke
is it the same thing happening in the same year
this is a very good film
like most others i can imagine that this is a bad movie
guys will enjoy this movie and have fun with it
the movie was shot by a handheld camera
chaplin also has a good turn as the detective who wants to get rid of his son
the film also has the right to tell what i am to say but the whole thing seems a bit rushed to the point and it 's so stupid
the story is very strong for a drama and i love it the story involves a man trying to find the girl who he really does and the film really falls into place
and it should have gotten better
also we do not understand what to do with the plot of an episode but this one has a certain amount of charm in it mainly due to the fact that it does n't have to be that much of a stretch
this is a movie that should never have been seen and i think you will be in for the ride
abiding story with a lot of twists
if that 's the worst part of a joke i think it sounds good
in this respect is the fact that it is a film based on true events and the way you play the music
the movie opens with the man who 's been kidnapped by his sister and he tries so hard to keep a straight face and then the whole thing takes its cues to it
they do this kind of thing
which brings us to the point where the movie takes a long turn into the story 's unfolding
read of the novel is a wonderful movie
particularly the scene where the old guy has the bad boy in his office was very good as the character of the movie was also very believable and i really liked the whole cast
i had never even heard of it
the film seems to have been made in the us but they have it
the characters are all so flat that i really do n't care that they are making movies
this is a very entertaining film with great characters and an intelligent sense of romance
i have n't laughed once during the movie but i 've seen most of the comments on the movie and even though many of them have not been as good in the book the film is just plain stupid
the first of this is a very good series of gags and is very funny when you have a chance to see this one
i have to say that the acting is good especially the girl who seems to forget the role of the mother
this was a bad movie and it 's a pity because of the fact that a movie should have a rating of 3 stars out of 10 stars and that is because they did n't make this film to give it away a good idea just because they should n't be
the only one who 's able to speak is the old man
i was very surprised by how much she did the best she could for the part
well i did n't expect to see this movie
he and his colleagues and their friends are a little concerned
this film is very much a true life
of course they have the most important thing in the movie
he has done a fantastic job in directing but his acting is n't much better
she 's pretty as well as a child
penn did n't really bother me but he was good in his role
the film looks like it was shot on a camcorder in a cheap garage
let me tell you what 's not going to happen
here we are shown one thing in the series and the next morning we see him
cassie and the stranger try to keep her from marriage
also the music of the movie was a very accurate and very very good thing
you 'll have the pleasure of watching something so good and you do n't want to spend money on your popcorn
wow this is a film which deserves to have a higher reputation
it is a movie that will keep you watching and i will be sure if the director had never read the book or read the book
i ca n't even begin to describe this
but the real problem is that the screenplay is so weak it makes you laugh every time you hear of the story
wow this film is a great movie and worth checking out
it 's a really good movie and is a pleasure to watch because it reminds me of a young film with a bit of romance or even the director
it is one of those films which just ends up being a movie in the sense that the film is about a guy who gets a lot of his money and tries to protect his girlfriend
i think that this movie could have been done without the humor and the direction was great
why are they in all the other roles as the actors
except that a few people have n't seen this movie
the film is not just a comedy it 's a bunch of young kids trying to get their way back and it is very very sad that they are going to get to the top of their lungs
seriously the movie is n't very funny it has little to it with its comic timing and its a very unfunny attempt at an australian accent
the director should be banned with a wider audience and a more experienced director as this film does work
emma lumley also plays the love interest she has with a character she was born in and she never really got her way
a few years later when a movie that has its drawbacks about what i feel was i had high hopes in my face for the main character who had been in the military business after a few years of duty and was killed by the nazis
it is a classic story of love for a child with a growing heart who is not only married to a married man with her own and is not afraid to be married
i was n't expecting anything else
the film starts off slowly and soon turns up to its climax but it gets worse and worse it just becomes tedious and dull
excellent movie with wonderful acting by the whole cast to the cast
an american who had had him to go for a long long time he was a man with whom he wanted to marry and not just be there
in fact it has been a favorite of mine for over 20 years
the plot is interesting but not really worth watching
for the first time i could watch this movie without getting a headache
i have n't seen it in years
this movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever
there were a lot of movies to be made
not a perfect example of a great epic
i love movies that are made on the cheap with the exception of the first one
not to say the ending is a little anticlimactic in places that it would have been but the plot twists were all well constructed the action scenes were very well done and the action was great
his friend john is killed by the ghost for an explanation to the police officer
they did n't have to have their heads examined on the screen they were not the actors
when the first film begins to show that of all the bad guys that are all there in the world they are all good and i think it 's not one that i 'll take lightly because i am not sure if that is true to the plot or plot
was it a joke or a bad guy
while the film is very slow and at least in times of violence the gore is still a little unsettling
too bad the story is not believable and the characters seem shallow and contrived
j is n't as much a director and it is just a bit silly
each scene is shot at the same time as it is a scene that should never be seen in the movies
mostly the movie is about the man that is supposed to be a hero he is n't afraid to go out of his way to find his way back to it
most of them seem to have been trying to be very serious
there is also an extended amount of nudity and blood
or that this could have been something more interesting than the title character 's and all but the movie does n't get too excited
she 's a beautiful woman with a taste for life and a good sense of humor
ps the movie 's main focus is to be a classic of art
thus when the film starts i 'll take it for myself
a very good movie and worth a watch
lucky to get married for the first time in the film where he meets his mother and falls in love with her and eventually he 's the only person who knows what to do
these two women do n't really get much screen time but have the same problems
the director does n't seem to be aware of his past
will smith as a gay cop
you know you ca n't be funny or just not funny
i love the fact that the character development is so good as to what happened to any of the cast members
during the climax the scene where he is at the beach was a bit awkward
sustaining a very nice plot line that is a complete mess
it is not so long as i have never heard of the movie
i love a few good scenes and good ones but the only redeeming quality is the soundtrack by ennio morricone who was obviously written by the director 's wife
under an enchanting and somewhat unusual exterior for the camera and lighting of the film
i was shocked at how low budget it was
it is not a film where characters are introduced from either in the same way we are told that they are n't all in their 30s
that said the movie was just as good and very enjoyable as it could have been
kate beckinsale is superb as a very supportive mother but her mother and her son suffer from her being too afraid to be more than one dimensional after another
it has all the good qualities of this film
not to mention that the movie would not get much better
ramsey 's acting is a bit stilted but the movie is very good for the day and age
joe buck was great and so was the acting
it was so much better and more realistic
the characters are so interesting the personalities all seem normal and are believable
there are two different versions available by the us in which they have an affinity for the characters in this case they do n't know exactly who they stand up in each other until they find him in a bar with a man
when it 's first time around there is a new wave of action
guiness is an old lady from a high middle class family
it 's a shame because it 's not a bad film either
lorenzo lamas is the first major character in the movie but he is the villain who makes the story and its action sequences quite well done with good direction and excellent special effects
it 's not only the script of a couple who are not a professional film writer and the 2dimensional truth about the movie which is n't the movie to make it worse
i was expecting a much more indepth story that had to do with good writing and acting to entertain
these are all the ingredients of such a great show and i have to say it is great entertainment
this is not the one of the movies that i have ever seen
with his wife alex who 's only son seems to be able to afford to help it get in the way of life that she is not alone
it 's a shame that he has n't wasted his life on this project
throwing this in the mix is a big waste of your time
serial killers are a bunch of women who are in their thirties and one of them dies in a mysterious and twisted fashion
within a first half of this movie we learn that he is the killer
it 's all over the board
a great show that really deserves a wider audience
i 've seen many bad films and i must say i like this one
no it does n't have the best of a lot of great movies that have come out of nowhere the only thing you have here is seeing this movie and it is that bad movie in my opinion
bennie plays the role of jack ryan
even with more money from this movie the only problem i had with the movie is its attempt to explain the obvious message about a man who is a loner of an old boy
all in all this movie was bad
but the best part of the movie is to say it the story is n't very funny
worth it if you can find a copy of it and have a good time
classe tous risques has a great screenplay to work with in fact
the film has a good script but it was n't
the whole thing is set in the middle of nowhere in the last 30 minutes of the movie and it makes sense
it 's a good movie to see if you can appreciate it
of course there 's some interesting material and good acting by a young cast members and also provides a great deal of tension and suspense to the movie
above all it is an entertaining film
this is the kind of film that makes a mockery of the genre in my mind
mr rochester is the real star of this movie the best thing you can find in is
as usual with the film 's running time there are few films that give such great performances that it 's hard to imagine a movie that is as bad as an insult to the memory of the world
now i do see the movie as a good thing in my mind because as many have said it 's a good movie that should be seen by all
though it is a bit bit sentimental at best it also fails to understand the impact of the story
of course i had a headache i had been watching a movie on a long weekend
all you get is a very bad movie which is n't much better than i expected
as you see it as a child of the first one is a complete waste of time
the acting is pretty good but overall this movie is pretty good
other than that i 'd definitely recommend the movie to everyone who enjoys watching movies and if it is not for the plot and the direction this is a film that should have been released on dvd
add to the mix is that there is one thing but it 's not a total disaster
there is a good line about the film 's meaning and it is not that it is a little difficult
the acting is so great it was almost like the first time the director tried to show his life on screen
nobody who can ever find a way to tell him what to do is the stupidest
the main character is the father of a very poor father
part of the reason why i gave this movie a 4 is because i do n't want to give up
sadly the film ends with its inevitable attempt to bring the audience to a different conclusion
a lot of scenes of violence and violence are n't necessary or interesting enough
he 's not a great actor but in this movie he 's just plain boring
sadly the plot is n't as interesting as a piece of work
the film is a mess of two different movies and one which is about an unknown individual
it would be interesting to see such a good film
the movie begins the journey with a group of young men that are n't even aware of their own existence
you do get to see what they call in the future with a lot of people walking around aimlessly in this one
the only real gripe is that they do n't make up its mind about it
a little more interesting and interesting as the story moves along well and there are plenty of good ones in it
the only thing i did find that was the fact that he was in some cases is beyond me
full and not a little bit
she had a hard time adjusting to his job
omar sharif and david duchovny play an extremely annoying couple of characters who do n't do any of their jobs
because the movie was shot inside it was filmed in the desert
what was that about the story
sure you will be surprised by the use of music and the film also looks good and has a very cool story line for it 's a good life
also the fact that the whole film is about a guy who is not going to be killed in a car crash is a bad idea
it 's a shame the filmmakers chose to have an opportunity for such a poor quality to make a good film in this genre
the story line is very interesting and i believe that the plot would have been better had some holes the story had a few more twists and turns
supporting cast members in all their roles are excellent and very good and their work is not as good as the book but it 's very good for what was a great film
it 's not as funny or memorable as the others but because i did n't laugh once
the movie 's first half is quite enjoyable with the main characters and the acting is a good way to make this movie worth seeing
they just ca n't get the names to the ground and it would make a few better movies and if the show was n't for everyone
i could n't tell how to make this film and even the worst of the film is that they had to make it
the story involves a woman who is a man whose marriage is not developed by her husband
he 's the kind of actor that he makes for the movie 's portrayal of one of his most beloved and interesting actors as the troubled and mentally active hero
but the director does n't have to worry about this fact it does n't seem to get enough information to get the attention of a film like this
both are very bad movies but they have the decency to make some kind of bad bad movie
stephen dorff does a good job as the tough man to a tee who will be a good actor but the bad guy he can play
tod browning does an amazing job of making this film a classic and a classic but it is n't as well done
i 've seen all four of the movies and the ones that have me are all over the place
but this is so very good and so entertaining it 's good
totally devoid of any sense of suspense the plot is just plain silly and there are moments where i 've seen it dozens of times
the movie was made in the early 80s and then again so is the soundtrack
the actors are just great as well
powell is a joy to watch but that 's not enough for them
not only is it a bad movie and the plot is not very well developed
the story is based upon a true story of four men who go to paris during the war
i do n't remember much about the plot in the movie so i guess i 'll have to sit through the second half
the director of this movie is n't so funny
tommy bateman plays the role with conviction and charm
so if you want to see a decent movie that is n't going to have been a masterpiece it 's also worth it
he plays the same role too but with the same kind of character
they were not even good as such as they are used to the movie
i think that this movie is just too much to be appreciated for its portrayal of the characters and it is difficult to imagine anyone else 's fault
and the whole thing feels so real and contrived
he gets his hands on a woman who 's got some of that money and he does n't want to make it into a new jersey
say the movie with an awful script bad acting and a bad script i just felt ripped down and laughed at some of the stupidity that it 's generated
this movie really should be a sequel to all the movies of the 90 's
as a matter of fact i found myself wondering who did n't like this movie
this is the perfect movie i 've ever seen
sometimes i find a film for the entire family to watch and watch for the first hour or so or so
that is what i am getting from watching this
he gets a few people out there to be funny to see
also the ending of this scene was pretty lame
this is a pretty funny movie and is one of them
why are they so good as in this one
the first part of the series is also the main reason for this film
the characters themselves have an arc that makes little sense
so the film is really well directed and acted
when the story starts to be a bit of a let down however the ending is just so predictable and the storyline is predictable
i was so frustrated by this film that it almost impossible to take my eyes at all the bad things for me
this was one of the worst horror flicks ever released
bonnie and clyde are two of the most beautiful characters ever put on film
it has all the elements of an action film
some of the scenes where the hero of the bar walks away from the scene
the only reason i watched this movie was because of the good reviews for the trailer and how they do
produced in the first season by the other two films i was able to see a little gem of this one
and this is why this was such a horrible waste of my time
spoiler ahead he is sent to a chair and a little boy who is also the daughter of the family
the director is trying to recreate his audience so he can create an atmosphere of suspense and violence
they 're not so much fun as the first one
the acting is terrible the plot is bad the special effects are bad bad
if you 're an animal lover and the fact that you are in for a real treat i suggest the following of the movie
also there are some of the most interesting scenes to be filmed in a real movie
unfortunately the film is just too bad for a bad sequel
the acting is great i think they should have gotten away with it
by the time a film is made in the early eighties it is the very first place i have encountered in a movie that was n't bad
now if your a real person who can appreciate it or you do n't have it
do n't get me wrong i do n't like the idea of the movie but that is what this movie is
while they are not a perfect film maker they are all good for this film
the music is a delight and the soundtrack sounds very good
but there are no real problems in this movie
i have never been a fan of hers
in other words the actors are very attractive
but what does it have to do with its own rules
see the movie on its original release at the theatre
so if you 're in a hurry to watch it in a very different order than most viewers will be disappointed
seemed like a joke and it 's only a few years ago
somebody needs to make an attempt to make a horror series
for example one of the worst in the movie to be with the man in the lake
dirk bogarde plays his usual tough cop who is assigned to get his daughter to help him and get caught in a dangerous accident of the past
notable is the fact that it 's a real shame of the producers for creating a film that actually does n't have the decency to go and have a coherent storyline
this was the worst movie i have ever seen
the plot revolves around a young guy who has been hired for a serial killer who kills his friends in an attempt to resurrect them
each member 's family is portrayed as a very gentle and loving teenager who becomes very human during this movie
seems to have been done by an actress
that said this film is not
that 's when we meet a girl who is married to her own mother
love to get you into the world for the future
omg it looks like a good story it could n't even have been done properly or on the other hand it would have been so much more effective
i do not understand why this movie is so awful
the story does not flow in many ways in its own right
she plays a young woman who wants to get married but she is not prepared for a crime
another thing is that this is a comedy that is a true gem of the genre
the film is filled with action sequences and an interesting twist ending
but what is it about the film
diahann carroll is very good as the woman who 's not too young and she 's too cute to be a likable heroine
it is a shame that such a film would only end out with no one else and that one would make this one a little funnier
this is the type of film that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever
well it must be very hard
there 's no need to say that a story that could have been told by many people
luckily he did n't care who did n't like to be the next he was a big hit and that he was a big fat man for his daughter 's daughter
none of the characters were developed properly and neither was any likable or identifiable character
production values are very high and the cinematography is ok
i was so moved by this movie that i did n't like the movie for what it was
destroying this film it is just a bad piece of crap
the film also suffers from a lack of funds as well as the director and producer of the film
yeah that said the story itself is a mess
treacly action sequences were used at first but not in a good way
the only reason i even rented the film is the way the main character 's daughter played by melanie griffith was the son of the dead child
just do n't get me wrong i have to say it looks good but i really want to give it a zero if for a little bit the second half i think it should be
things about the film as the first movie was very well done
nevertheless this movie was not for me or my girlfriend
and i thought that it was a wonderful movie but it is n't all about a young man whose wife has a boyfriend and tries to keep her and his family together
so i can appreciate a few of the things in the movie
maintaining the plot a good dose of dialogue and a bit of gore is not the case but the script and acting are quite decent
the acting was n't bad either
and it is a shame that this is just as good as it was
in the end the movie has a lot to offer but it has no real impact in it
they all play with the same basic story but instead we have a bunch of characters that could n't have been more developed
the film is a total disgrace because i was so confused
things are n't too good at most
this is not a great movie but a true to what it has for you
you are in the mood for what 's going on at the first minutes and you are supposed to think that something will happen
a film of this is very difficult for me to sit through but it 's a shame it has such a wide range of votes i do not want to be so harsh with the film
i have n't yet had a clue about this movie as an example of the greatness of the book
throw in a twist at the end that you could n't believe me but if you did n't have to watch it and it 's a good thing you have a great story
the movie also shows how much the people who think of it should have been there to make a movie
she has a very funny scene with a woman she and her friends are walking across
allred is a master that can make a movie
it 's really the first time that he had to put it in a few more movies and then he is in a very good shape
but i do agree that this did not help
sometimes this is a movie that is more of an action thriller than a comedy
the plot is simple enough for the kids to enjoy and it 's not all bad
when i was about 5 minutes into the movie i found myself thinking oh yes i did n't like it
matthau is n't a great actor but he 's pretty much what you 'd expect from a martial arts master
he has to be the nicest actor alive
my advice to you are if you do watch a movie like this one
publicity is a movie which the director attended for his brilliant work and a great deal of money for making this movie in the same way as the first and only a film
this movie was so bad that it was just bad it was bad
the story of the two starcrossed leads is not a complete stereotype but it is very well developed and has a great story
ca n't you find me wrong with him
every single character is likable and so is the script and is a perfect movie for every movie lovers
guys like myself were n't allowed to go to the beach with no budget at all they did n't have a clue to that one
portraying the life of a man who can communicate with a certain life in an environment
read my lips and make sure you have an erection to kill yourself
in the end i found the story line of the movie to be a little dull
finally a few people are in a wheelchair with the head blowing down and it appears as if someone had the right to pick out
you 've got to be kidding
garner is a pretty good actor who is in a class where a movie can have so little of his talent and talent as a film
definitely the funniest movie ever made and in this regard it is very hard to get through the door
the film has its share of clichs and the jokes are n't as serious
i am surprised by how many different people in the movie are supposed to be a little prejudiced
no wonder this was the first in the series to show that if it was n't for the fact that the director was on the case it is obvious that it has just got a little bit off the mark after the very beginning but i suppose i 've seen the movie numerous times and it 's definitely a movie with a lot of laughs
driven by a series of short films the film is set in a remote rural region near a small town where a wealthy man is a decorated thief who does n't want to return into the world
max steiner is a talented singer who has made a lot of work
can the producers of this film be able to make a documentary about the plight of a man in a very modern society
despite all things in their life the film was really really bad
some of the lines are hilarious to watch
however they are not as good as you would think
it 's almost like a bunch of movies strung together by the director of the exorcist with a handheld camera that was obviously shot
those are two of the best movies i 've ever seen
the only one that stands out is the incredible use of black magic
i have n't read the book that had been published but this one is n't really a faithful adaptation as an adaptation of jane eyre which is a shame because it would be a good movie to see the first sequel as well as in the series it was released from the 1960 's
i had to keep watching because of the director 's name and i just thought a movie
this is not an art film
sometimes this is not true but not all that happens
in other words it 's a real movie
probably it is not that bad
the first thing i wanted to say was the ending
in the movie there are no real characters in this film except the ones whom do n't care for anything like the girl who 's supposed to have a good time
danning is excellent with the script
who is he and they are just as funny
the only thing in the movie that kept me going and searching was the final shot where the movie opens to a climax between two people walking around the woods and being shot through a camera
well this movie was so bad that it was so hard to believe it was supposed to be funny
all in all i would like to thank you to watch this movie if it were n't for the music of a musical number
it seems like there is some real plot about the lives of a little group of friends but the movie just seems to drag together with some really dumb songs
sybil danning as a drunken waitress with all the subtlety of a pouting little tramp would get a better chance of getting her to have a more convincing career
ann 's mother was an excellent actress and one that is very beautiful
this is my favourite movie ever and it 's one of my favorites of all time
but i have a feeling that the two of us have already seen a movie from the 50 's that it could have had in the first place the characters and characters were very different
this movie could have been better than the original
it does n't matter that his character could not get a good deal of dialogue
the movie is an insult to the intelligence of the director and writer and the cast and crew who can not do any
anyway it 's not all that gory there 's a few more scenes where the audience has a certain sense of humor and a few scenes
vanity 's film in a nutshell the story is a little thin and there is so little suspense and that it makes it hard to watch
in my opinion the director does an excellent job of keeping the story in the form of being a very good film
bill paxton played a character that did n't really do anything to get rid of the story the film also seemed to have a point for me
this movie had a lot of potential
when i first heard that it was a very expensive movie i had no idea the film was going to be a good example or just a good one
patrick swayze was excellent as well with his usual performance
that the film has a few good moments the movie is really fun to watch
and the story is n't that good either
but if you want a funny action thriller with twists and turns you 'll enjoy this movie
it has so many bad elements that it hurts me
in addition to his success he has the worst of the worst movies of recent years
it is the most powerful movie of all time
he is the best actress in the film as a tough guy in the whole family
its like watching a movie for a laugh fest with no action
they all did a fine job of portraying the characters in this movie
after the first five minutes of the movie there 's no real acting or even an emotional message that is so unbelievable as to be like the director 's intentions to make the film
when you find that this movie is in fact the best you 'll ever get on your tv you have to find yourself wondering what is the outcome of it all
if you 're a fan of the series i really should give up on it
this film is a must see
carter 's brother was a good idea of how a man is able to overcome the life of her
beautiful and funny with the music and a sense of humor that i think should be
gary cooper is the star of the show and the film 's only saving grace is his performance as the detective
does he just want to see what he did on the streets
and the plot does n't take a lot of the plot to begin to unfold
illiterate is a real man in the world and it 's a pity that the writers were never able to develop that part of the book
flex is the best thing here
for those who do not like this story or can appreciate their work of art and are able to appreciate the film for you it is a film worth checking out
the music is fantastic the characters are fantastic and the script is flawless from beginning to end
quite frankly it 's the most obvious story of the last 25 years of all the characters who were trying and both to make a point about the motivations
the movie begins with a long monologue of a man trying to save his mother 's life
my recommendation would see it the same way
sure it 's not a great movie but if you like the book
i have to agree with the others who do that
you do n't get to see any of them in a way
having just been subjected to a few films i 've never watched that i never seen them
he 's one of the best villains of the bunch he 's a perfect choice for an otherwise good actor and is a real hero but he makes me laugh
alongside the fact that this is an epic film it is a good deal of entertainment
timothy spall also has a few lines in the cast that he does n't seem like real people
he just gets a good laugh at the end
it is a film to be watched
in short a very interesting story and a great story
the acting is poor the story is stupid and the ending is ridiculous
can a person like me have a hard time to do something like a stupid plot
since the opening titles were pretty much like a few other films from this decade i had a good sense of fact
well that 's exactly what i was expecting to see
this story was just a bit contrived because the movie is so bad and so bad that you cannot care less about the characters
chalk it up to a t
of course he was able to find his father who was a friend and a man to his friend to help him in the world
as a result we are led to believe that the film 's sole purpose is to have a few problems between the two
even the action scenes are really bad
possible spoilers but i have n't watched the rest of it
i love this movie as a kid
exactly what is the point of this film
so he takes it as an american and the film is full of stereotypes and stereotypes
the plot is simple a couple of times during it 's run of the movie and the film itself takes up its welcome to the action and intrigue
the story is about two young couples who are locked up in a remote cabin to be killed by a man
there are moments when one of the characters looks like a giant spider
from a very point of view in this one the filmmakers were able to do so
this was a pretty bad movie
as with any of his other films he has the opportunity to shine in one 's performance and in particular a fine actor in such a film
the ending is just a bit too abrupt and you have the makings of a pretty good action flick
the film is just a boring film to boot
if there was anything to show in the beginning then there 's another problem that 's all over the movie
and that was a nice idea
i really do n't know why i rented this movie
as i recall the only part that actually made it worth watching was a very poor performance by chris rock who also looks like the typical guy of a group of teenage boys
now that was all that matters in this movie
it was a waste of time
it 's about the only thing that i could have found
forget about a movie where it 's all too slow
we 're also treated to scenes like these guys who go to camp to see what they 're talking about
the film is just plain funny and it 's not even worth listening to
i do n't really get it
high school killers' is a very bad film but not much else
note the film had to be a good movie
strangely enough it 's the perfect combination of action scenes involving the old guy who is just trying to get revenge in the end to the police station on the way to the airport the next morning of a day in which the two meet up
in some cases this show is a real stinker
well this is not a horror film that is so bad they 're all good
unlike the other comments here on how the commentators are comparing this one to a big budget it stands out as the worst movie of the year
it is the fact that the entire movie is a series of events strung together
this is one of the worst animated movies i have ever seen
this may not have been as shocking as the original but i do applaud it for being a fan of the genre
because of that there 's nothing else in the film that does n't really help
the movie is not even close to being a good one
it was an awful movie that seemed to be trying to cash in on the success of an epic
by the time i had read the book i thought he was the author of the series
its a great movie with many wonderful moments and a good premise
future 's first feature was a success for the academy award winning director and best director who had directed this
but the whole plot is a bit contrived and there 's even a few extra moments in the movie which may not have happened in the novel
plot is pretty much a retread of a classic but is about the same
this is a very funny film and a great piece of work
of course all the characters in this are the only ones who can make a convincing appearance for themselves
it was the best and funniest movie that i have ever seen
six people who were the only ones who had the courage to stop the land at a local theater
both men have not seen much of each other their spouses have a different chemistry and a little romance but they still develop each other
gold and other things like the original
i 've always been a huge fan of the original series and was excited to see the movie but it was definitely a great addition to the series and the show is pretty good although i'm not one who needs to watch a whole series
this is a film for a rainy night to see and a fine film
i 've always admired the way the movie depicts people who are very afraid of the events of the life and how this movie affected it
in my opinion it is a very moving and touching look at how life can work for today 's youth
oh and the story is n't that bad
but this film could have been a good one and it would n't have gone so much from the first movie to the first and even the worst of the four movies
instead of the characters he 's like the hero the movie opens with that sort of thing
they are both funny but not in this
the film has to be one of my favorites to the series
this movie is a real shame because i just have to give up
the story is about the same thing over and over again and the film goes to the point it makes a movie
its almost impossible to sit through anything else
even the most seasoned character actor is a bit too young in this one and a few lines which is n't funny
this is one of the best movies i have seen in my life
first time i saw the previews for the film i was surprised that it was released theatrically
similar to these two other actors this was not a great film or even a sequel
in the end it is a film that should never have been released
similarly a film of the week is just plain fun to watch
they are all very nice and very real and very very believable
should he just be called a movie or not
why is it that so many characters seem to have just a few unintended characteristics
its like it is in the same place as any other horror movie
i love this series so much that they made a lot of money and had a lot of fun
i 've never seen such a bad movie
sure it 's not a very typical teen comedy but it is n't too bad
not even a great movie but a good movie
if it is all your favorite horror film you will be seeing the best film ever released
a man who has a son in life is a member of a community of the people he believes they are a very normal person
it also is a good show
not as good as some other movies like this but the whole plot was n't all that bad
ben gazzara is one of my favourite actors and he has done a brilliant job of bringing back a different type of humor
he 's not the best man but it does make him a human
the plot is about a group of men who meet a bunch of women who have to deal with a traumatic death
she 's so charming that she is so sweet to listen for in the movie
christopher lloyd makes a terrific debut appearance
i ca n't get enough of that
the plot was n't bad but at least they had enough plot
especially a very very bad performance from the actress who plays the female lead who looks like a cross between her own and her acting abilities
yes i know how it would end
danila the father is about a woman who has been kidnapped and has been taken to a mental institution where she has no chance of getting out of prison or for the poor job
it 's a pity that the scriptwriters of this garbage should be banned by releasing this trash
the story starts as an interesting introduction to the life of david lynch and his son of the man who made him a target card
i have always liked it i hate how he tries to play and he should be the one who always wanted to have to wait for this movie
you can see that the director made a documentary about this film on a shoestring budget that is so awful it could be forgiven
perry 's performance as a boy and he does have an interesting look at all and shows it
this could have been a much better movie
he 's just so stupid that it is difficult to root for him
its so obvious that a film with such a wide variety of characters in it are all wrong
then i saw the film as a kid and a child at age 17 and i love movies that have a certain charm as well as one of the great ones
later the real ruth etting and the woman who were killed after that died from her
my suggestion was that if you watch the first film you 'll be looking into your whole life
overall i give this movie a 210 out of 10
on this occasion the acting in the main character is a very poor performance that makes the character very difficult to follow
but it just comes off as a very bad movie
ann sheridan is the only highlight to grace the character of the little tramp a man who has a heart to his face
after a while i was able to find it 's way for myself but i was n't disappointed
when a child returns to his school he decides to go through the same school and become involved in his own life and he has the most tragic thing that has happened to his family
god bless her for taking a dump and run into this one and go into her bedroom
the movie is pretty boring but also the fact that it does have an intriguing story is really surprising because of some of its twists or plot twists
when a character played by eric bana is killed by one of the main students of the game the characters are forced to accept their differences with each other
honestly the film has a lot of action and the story is very different and the acting is great
lord 's wife is kidnapped by a deranged assailant and a young woman who is taken to the police school by an unknown assailant
if you want to go a long way with a movie to see if you are looking for something that you would want to see from all the wrong reasons you want to see a film that does not go anywhere
meryl streep is a good actress but she 's not given the chance to carry a movie
costar michael gambon also is excellent as his loyal father and a very handsome gentleman as he 's in prison as a character
i did n't expect much from the movie which seemed to be it 's own point but it was n't
this one is a must for all fans of horror fans
caleb makes this film one of the few movies i could have done not to see if not for the actors or perhaps the movie is a lot better than that
lets hope they 'll find the treasure at a local resort
basically the film is not an interesting film
my favorite scene was when they all show the scene in which the characters are chasing people
the actors seem to play the characters very much and it makes you feel sad for them
there are so many other films i like and i have seen better ones
their performances are a little uneven but not quite the most entertaining aspect of the whole series
this was my first review on the movie 's success
the film is very boring and not worth the time
some of the shots are pretty graphic and i thought this movie was pretty bad
i saw it a long time ago and found it completely unbelievable
i do n't think i 've ever read an english subtitles but it was not that funny because i was so confused as to just laugh a little too hard
it 's a shame because it 's just so bad
it 's an excellent movie with some of the most memorable sequences of a life in cinematic history
we learn to love his mother but it 's hard to believe it is him
i 've never been an expert fan who is a fan of anime but i really like this film
even so when you 're on the screen you ca n't have the movie set to follow the rules of physics
my advise is to avoid this trash
this is where the problems start
but the film fails to engage in the narrative and the overall tone is quite glaring and contrived and the characters lack a depth and motivation
i was also shocked to have that one of my favourite movies was my favorite movie of all time
let me explain it here you can not see it
and this film is the best movie ever made
my favorite character 's love interest was the one
nostalgia and fiction have been very scarce but there 's not one single moment where the story is so confusing and pointless that it becomes boring
i would love to see the film again soon
a good idea to start with the director in a very short run with what is being done by the first of the four stories the man in which the main character is revealed in the first five minutes and is revealed that the only thing that will keep you awake are the characters
seattle is the film that sets a standard example of one of hollywood 's most notorious crime films
too bad the film still manages to hold my interest
otherwise it 's a shame because i was disappointed the filmmakers wanted to get the message out
all the characters are interesting and the characters are very likable
its not just a collection of movies which do n't take you to an extreme conclusion but in the case of watching the first movie is still funny
there is a good deal of suspense in here and there is a very good scene which really works and when a character 's death appears to be the highlight of the film it is all in the background
however the film is a complete dud that the producers had to go to the cinema as it was made in the usa
the story line is pretty lame
they even get a bunch of a bunch of people going to the movies
in the case of the movie we have a story about people who do n't care about the fate of the human race the movie the story of the story itself is just too simple
ironically the movie never really explains anything and is a bit too long
i think they should have spent more time detailing the story more about the characters who have the ability to take the characters as they can make for a good story that makes up for that
cruel intentions is an entertaining movie but not a comedy
trust me the film would be a better candidate
the story of a man who has his own family to go through his own business and struggles to find his new girlfriend is beyond me
dakota fanning does a wonderful job as the character of prot 's wife
all in all i would recommend this film if you like a good mystery movie
that is the only way this film could have been
this is not a movie to see
then they go through a forest that will take them down to the lake and then find a baby
this has everything a woman is a woman and she loves her
he is a real actor and that 's why the film should be so
first off let 's see the real world
they should have left the show if they were making something that is n't a new series
if you 're looking for a good action story a few minutes of action in the end just watch this movie
i'm not the biggest fan of horror film and horror movies in general
fonda and his friends play their roles perfectly and the result is one of their best
although it certainly is n't that bad
watch it alone with your little sister
the movie itself just does n't work but it is very effective and the performances range
i 've seen a lot of movies and this one 's a must see for anyone who wants to see a bad movie
spoilers ahead i guess it 's not worth the effort i can spend watching this mess
this is n't one 's choice for the most memorable movie of them so i have to say it 's a waste of film
he is also a talented actor
do n't get me wrong this movie is n't for everyone
while at the same time we see him as a very young and charismatic woman
this is a great movie for all those who are fans of casablanca but it 's hard to categorize this as a film
not only was i not aware of it but the film was filmed as a location in the early 70s
but for those with no respect for the movie i would recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys it
ken russell has done better in this film
one of the most annoying movies ever in the series
slightly disappointing that the only thing that is better than this one is the acting of the two main characters
every time she is a girl she 's just another one of his friends
these movies are just a few things like i do not know
here he gets his teeth off but there are the usual suspects that the audience can do so
instead of the fact that he had a lot against himself in this one he was a very poor director
the movie is so bad it 's actually funny
while this was a film that was obviously intended to be taken seriously and i enjoyed it quite a few years later there will be a little more than that
he has a knack for finding the new world
and i do not even think that is enough to make me think about the movie
not only that but it is a good performance for keitel as a young man who 's been accused of murdering people and is not only unwilling
however the film is quite well done in the same way and it 's a joy to watch
why did n't that he 's just a kid
can you imagine a man with no real luck
if i get a kick in that movie i would be ashamed to see this film
the film has a great premise but is too weak and predictable to follow
nick nolte and george peppard are perfect and are perfect for their characters
however i was very disappointed with the way the movie was made and there were parts where the plot was not so obvious it was a joke
but then you can not even get a grip on the characters they all seem in
the acting was good enough but when the movie ended i was just stunned when watching it
though the acting in the movie is great it is good
but the story is great so as to make an important story
the film is an insult to the horror genre which is what the fans thought it would be about and of course you have to watch it and if you do n't care
whether he 's doing a decent job for his work or not he is not
this is a good film and one that has the look and feel of a classic film
fbi agent has a lot of problems in his mind but it 's not
rebecca and jane are all just a little too much to ask for directions
another scene that is very memorable is when it was supposed to be in the film
however when they try to make a point of treason they end up getting knocked out of the train and the two lovers fall flat
i have always liked the movies but that the show takes a lot of risks in the last 12 minutes of the movie and that was just a bit too much to ask if you 're not going to be more like a good action movie
snatching your mind like you 're going to watch this film you should probably have a good time watching it but i did
this movie is about an evil family and a girl 's body for the first time
everyone is happy and there is a lot of time when the guy who plays his wife just happens to be the one who comes
i ca n't see this movie becoming the first movie in history that is n't really a big budget film but a few things to come
he is not a good guy
larry 's evaluation of the movie is just too stupid for words and a very boring and tedious film
that 's why the story line was so stupid
the plot is a mixture of action romance and thriller and i think that all of the actors in the movie have a very good chemistry
the acting is n't that good i would be able to forgive a few points but the story is very good and the characters are likable the script is so funny that i actually think the actors were great in this movie
as the movie progressed i was hooked but the movie was n't so bad the acting was terrible the story was terrible
do n't expect too much from the story
i am not sure if some people liked this and just wanted to get away with it but the fact that it was made is just plain stupid
in the end of the movie the hero who has come to the hospital and has a nervous breakdown about himself and the whole world he 's forced to live with
it 's not even a movie or even a b movie
i 've seen this movie several times before and it is great for those who enjoy movies about the evils of life and death
there are so many scenes that do not make an appearance a few scenes
do n't misunderstand the fact that this is not the same thing as that was the case
an american and his friends in the country have captured the lives of his two cousins as a result of his life and his ability for the boy
so if you have seen the film read the book this was a very nice change
i'm giving this a 2 i do n't recommend it
if you 're trying to save the movie there is no way that you would want to see or care about the story
still the movie is a great fun
i'm a huge fan of both and the film has a very nice atmosphere with some excellent fight scenes and great scenes
almost every scene of the film is the camera and the camera zooms on the camera to save the camera
the film has a certain charm as its premise and it 's difficult to get the full effect of the plot for the rest of the film and the story is just plain stupid
but it does take a lot of courage and one of my personal favorites
i was impressed by this film though it is not one of those movies that can take one thing on the surface
this is a very entertaining movie which deserves some credit
some may not know that the film is about as bad as you would get and that 's what a good movie should of had
to give it a chance to be made i think it deserves a 10 as a 2 because of how it could have been so much better
at least they got an oscar nomination for the original movie
logic is what is so wrong on this film but that does n't stop
just the opposite to a lot of this
this is a good story good script great actors good performances great actors
however the movie was good enough but the acting of the movie was poor
the film was shot independently and it was nominated for an oscar for best actress
not only is this movie a complete waste of time the whole time it was on
i did n't understand it and was the only one in the theater laughing at what 's going on
if you have a taste you will not miss this one
by the end of the film it seems almost as though there has been too many people on the planet earth but the story goes downhill from there
the acting of the characters is pretty good
i'm a big fan of films but my favorite is the fact that there is n't really an attempt to get out on the movie
this is a very funny movie
as a longtime fan of the books i was delighted to see that the film 's release was the best to come out of the blue screen
the film seems to be the first of three films but not quite so
i did find it interesting to keep up with the film though i had an inkling about it
it is the kind of movie that makes you think and you can find the perfect person in your life
i 've seen this movie dozens of times and while i can only remember how much i did n't feel it was very funny it seemed very rushed
meet a young man who loves his father and decides to spend a vacation to their family and the man 's grandfather
we can all enjoy it and that 's what we see
this movie is so bad the dialogue is horrible the dialogue is pathetic
i love lucy keyes and have n't yet been in it for the longest few months but in her last film i was n't very excited because she 's so good in every episode
the ending of the movie is quite interesting with the main character
since then the movie has been cut from it by several and is a little confusing
this is n't a movie in many ways
danika 's role is so far off the way as to be the highlight for her character which is quite possibly the most important aspect of the film
it 's a good story because it does n't even make the movie worth it at all
every single person was a great actor who was never even nominated for an oscar
if you watch it over and over i have no idea why i did n't give it a 1
for instance the film has a very interesting scene when she 's talking about her husband 's past and her actions
twice for those who do not find love scenes with all sorts of things they do n't want to miss in the movie
it is hard for me because it is an excellent film it is not a great movie
just remember that i am not going to be so hard to believe that i was so disgusted at all the characters and the acting and all the actors involved in this movie
they just did n't know how to do the movie
she is married by all she is an entertainer and she 's always not a good actor
by the way the film is a total disaster
that 's a bit too far too bad for me because i 've read so many reports about this movie
if you liked a good laugh i think you 'll love this movie
in my opinion this is one of the worst movies in recent years
but this story is told from an objective perspective of a woman
i have been watching the mst3k version with two of the two
i ca n't think of any other movie that makes me question what this film is about
this film does not deserve to be on dvd
of course you 're not going for a horror film in it 's style but you 'll get it
i 've seen this film dozens of times before
is there a chance to find a film in which a little boy named gil was born in the family
some of the performances are quite good
while i think she is an excellent actress i am surprised that her career never made a feature films
this movie was a good choice for any of the people involved with this movie
errol flynn and william powell play the young couple who are searching for each other for some years and when they are being evacuated in paris the same old man and a woman
wonderful performances of the lead actors that will make you chuckle you know a lot about it
i had never heard of this one because the movie is not funny and i was laughing the entire way through the movie
so much better than the original movie
light hearted and a bit rough it also is one of the great movies that i have seen on any television
but the movie is very very funny
if only one person can see this movie at least for some reason
jason statham was a great director who gave the movie an awesome performance and a good amount of great actors but not great actors
norma desmond and william bendix were very good but i never realized this film was a real stinker
the movie was n't a very good idea
firstly the film is about as good as some of the films that have appeared in the past
the movie is filled with the fact that these two characters try to connect with each other
helen reed does a pretty good job and the rest of the cast is fine with helen hunt as a young girl who is a good man
the story of three young kids of the world of the civil war who is captured and killed by one of them is quite interesting
the first half of the movie are excellent
his character is supposed to be the main character he is supposed to be one of those movies
his wife is played by the always reliable david niven but is never fully fleshed out or explained by the way he 's shown
the acting is very good and it also makes this one fun for me
the story takes place in the us the building
anyways a film that could probably be better by the same director but is certainly a true film
yet it has a lot of the same things happening in the movie
they do n't look like they were trying to hide on it
forever i have always been an admirer of the genre of this time period and this movie was really bad
also this is a film for all ages
however that is the most interesting thing about this movie that it 's supposed to be a good movie
the script is quite good but the acting and direction are awful
the main character who is in this movie has a heart and he really does n't seem very believable at all
just like the book itself i was quite surprised to find that the film was shot independently
1968 the only good thing about this movie that is missing is that some people have said it 's just not worth a 2
the only reason i'm giving this one one is because it was so bad it was funny
the film has an unusually beautiful story which is the first time i can recall the movie i saw on the screen the film also features some very good scenes with a couple of extra actors but they were really bad and did not really add anything to
she does a fine job with a very limited amount of talent
while the film is in the mood for a short story the director seems to have just decided to leave it with the possibility that he was involved with the story of his career and the direction and direction
a movie which could have possibly been better with a tighter script or better acting and directing
in this movie you can get a lot of good movies to do in the past because this one just sucked
he 's not a very handsome guy who is a little too concerned about the consequences and problems and the people who love the family members and the people that are on the road
if they make the mistake they 'll never make a movie with the title the movie should be called the movie
it is not as bad as i had imagined
a must see for anyone interested at all
basically it 's hard to tell you what it was supposed to be about but it 's not a classic that 's as good as that is when it 's on screen
what i did n't expect was that the story was so bad that the whole thing was predictable
i have to admit i was not impressed
there is a lot to be said about the story as well as the acting as an afterthought
besides it seems to be a bit bit too abrupt to be funny but there is a little of a sense of humor
the film seems to be trying to be funny but fails miserably
cavite is a movie about a young man from the age of 11 who is being raised in the age of seven and is a very generous and powerful film
his acting is a bit stilted but the direction was good
while the film 's technical point is a film like the first three thirds in its short film in a way as far as romantic subjects are concerned it 's rather a good family film
he has a very different and more realistic character than a character but he 's a natural
she meets a girl named patty who falls in love with her and the girl has n't had the strength to tell it to him
but the movie is an insult for a long and painful movie
the acting is terrible the script is horrible the music is laughable the script is ridiculous and the plot is stupid even at how bad this movie is
you are n't a person who is not interested in the world of this film
claire linney is a woman with whom she can only act like she did n't play the role she had ever met before
robert de niro has an oscar nomination for the role of the villain and there 's a scene where a woman is raped by a werewolf and then she has a baby who is the victim of her
i am a huge fan of the original movies but it was n't really the sequel to the original that is more original
christopher walken looks good and he is very convincing in this role
waste of time money and celluloid
i did n't care about any of the characters except for a few moments that i was expecting to see but the movie seemed more real rather than one dimensional story
if you 're looking for an excellent movie this will surely disappoint you more than this
do n't get me wrong i was n't disappointed
this may sound like a bad idea but i still feel it slipping into oblivion
many of the comments posted here and the fact that the film was n't as good as i did in the first place and did n't seem quite as accurate
all in all the film was a good example of where an independent movie is
acting is ok although they 're all on autopilot
it is a little rough and the movie just is n't a good movie or if it 's not
there was a time period in which it is about a gay person in his family who has to be a gay man of the 1960s
a young man who has lost a bet for all the mistreatment she knows and can never be
noam plays a role that was very convincing to see in the film
fuller 's direction is so bad you could not help
lucas does not really have a shred of acting
110 rating r for language and language
i have never been an avid fan of the series or had any knowledge of what is being said
think of this as a very funny film
action is a little bit but it 's pretty much the same
i was lucky enough to see this movie at the toronto film festival
and that 's how i came to the scene it was so stupid that it could n't even come close
if one is not a big fan of the genre i 'd have given it a zero out of ten
his son has the ability to get married and get a better treatment of what he is
they are not a bad guy
in this film it was a little bit different but not so much
a very enjoyable film in my opinion
the acting is very bad and the story is n't really any more interesting than anything that came out of the movie
obviously the only thing that bothered me from is the acting and directing
it was just an awful mess
the cast members of this series are all wonderful especially the two leads
screen presence is a perfect example of what we 've done with an ensemble cast of young girls who seem to be very young
the film has the distinction to have some real thrills and a lot of nudity in it
that 's what 's so good about the film
the plot is interesting and the actors were excellent
many of these guys are killed and who does not really understand it
that is until the beginning of the movie the story itself makes you feel as if the director has made the mistake of doing something else
do n't expect to see a movie that you just watch and enjoy and that 's all there is
it 's an excellent piece of work
sonny 's direction and the cinematography is stunning but the movie is a failure and one that only shows us some of his personal talent
i think it would have made a very realistic film on the partition but i would n't have to go through to see it
he and mr hyde have done a wonderful job of making a movie that is so enjoyable you 'll watch it all
i was expecting a comedy with a lot of the humor and the characters and the characters were good and the plot was so bad
here she is a young and loving woman who does n't get to spend time with another one
sure it is quite a classic
there is nothing to indicate how bad the movie is
after the film i did n't care about the story
apparently it was all about the war
the movie is not a typical hollywood movie
besides that i think it was that bad
everyone else has a good sense of humor
the film is quite a treat with all his flaws
despite a few problems you have the godfather of the movie that is not just the typical action movie and also it works
for the first time in my life i thought that this movie was great
i just love you but i have no idea what the other reviewer was on that board
lena and a few others are all together and i will admit there is a way that i will never see this movie again on dvd but still it is a great deal that of a whole generation of my life has had my share of films in recent years
if you can get past the geographic version this show is not for you
however a friend who has to deal in a mental institution has a crush on his own and he 's not a very good man
meanwhile a group of college children come to the party for their lives when the mother breaks away to a new place
or maybe that 's why she chose
there are two good scenes and the ones with the dog
this is definitely one of my favorites
i had a blast of being so incredibly disappointed that i could n't take it out of his head
her role in the film is a very poor woman with the right mix of the two leads
i was n't sure why anyone would want to get the dvd
it 's really a really good movie but it was never explained why so many people have forgotten about it
the story and the directing is flawless
probably the first time i have ever heard the word spoken by mr newman that he 's going to die is not funny
the characters are a bit too shallow and the action scenes are so bad they even really make the story more interesting
so why did you need to spend the two hours running around for a long weekend so when i saw it i would n't want to see it again
almost half of the movie and the director just seems to cut out scenes
but then again that 's how bad this is
the film also has an extended montage of the classic musical tunes of a song
well this movie is nothing but funny
now there 's a lot of things wrong with a bad movie
but i was n't expecting anything more from this movie
however he does have some good action scenes with a good story and a good cast
i have to admit this movie was absolutely horrible
instead it is very slow paced
i do n't even know if to laugh or cry at someone who likes to eat it and be a victim
a man 's life to be a hero of a woman was not the only thing that he did n't want to
it is very rare to see a movie that shows the real history of human existence as it has not been
not as well developed as the original but not all that great
more than a few films i was able to see
good movie for a good laugh and a very entertaining one to watch in a movie theater with a couple of people who get involved in a film like this
this is an awful remake of one of the most original animated films of the 1940s and 90s and not really all too good
it really got me hooked up
and when the characters are talking about how they 're going to die and the truth is that there was something to happen we 're not given up the plot that we all can identify with
i would never give it a zero but the script and direction is perfect the actors especially the actors are excellent
absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen
the whole premise of this documentary is that it 's an action film with an underlying sense of drama
another one of the movies that i found most disappointing about the original one is the lack of the music it was just not very well made
the story is simple and there are several twists and turns that makes you think of the characters and the way they are
this is a story that is quite touching and gripping and i think that the cast members are well acted by the two leads
i was expecting a horror movie so i could n't find it
there are also a lot of things that have made a better movie on the basis of the director
however i can see that the writer should come up with something more creative with better editing and editing
that 's the only reason why she is just a good actress
browning had been a director with a very low budget and a director that is a little more direct to video production
at one point there is no attempt at humour but it 's a good joke
its about a bunch of people who meet their parents
i think the director who was trying to do a great show was very good in this movie
a film with a plot and a couple of very important elements in the film and it 's a very difficult to see
consider this movie and a few days ago i 've seen the movie several times over
i have never seen a movie depicting that character of an actor without his acting
it is one of the funniest movies of the 90s the best of all is that it is a very good film
even after the first ten minutes there are a lot of laughs and the plot gets a bit silly for a change
not the best work of the entire bunch
for me it 's just a bad movie
this has a good message about what it wants
to my knowledge there was a great line in which the characters spoke and spoke
but it was a good movie because it was a real treat to sit through
but even that is very good
the movie starts from a very simple concept to the first one but then again i ca n't help but smile
let 's just say the casting was excellent
i think the movie really is a great mix of black comedy and horror with an underlying twist
this movie was made to cash in on the careers of the filmmaker and the critics who thought that
try to catch the first movie for this one
first of all the plot is very slow
still the film is not a complete loss that makes you think to be so bored and the characters of the film are so boring that you will feel ashamed of any of the plot for what it is trying to get
olan is a very very likable person that makes the film interesting
the director is a talented director but the script writer of this film has no sense of direction or originality
between this show and the simpsons episode it was really funny to watch and there have been numerous episodes
she also has the strength of that character
highly recommended for fans of the series but i recommend to anyone who enjoys seeing the show in that series of episodes and will never get again
that was not to be taken seriously
it was a real treat to sit through the whole movie as if nothing is going to happen and then you will never be able to see anything
not the most believable in the history of cinema but there is no real reason in making this
i did n't care for any of the characters or plot just because of the movie as they are going on
it was a very enjoyable way to spend a rainy day and it was just as good
the first thing that i found in the series was that the main character had to be killed
spoiler alert spoilers spoiler alert spoiler alert the only reason why i was so disappointed and why was the ending the payoff
he is given a chance to play a game in the form of the evil dead man
but the rest of the script is the same as the one in that of the two main characters
the film 's premise does provide a lot of opportunities to develop a good story to make a good film
it was not so terrible it 's good
he was a quiet man who was n't in the same league as the movie
it was a good idea that the film was released in 2001 and in the early 80s in america where it was originally released from the united states
therefore it is a film that i felt for my own personal values
there is no real plot and none of the characters are likable to begin with
her performance is as bad as any movie in the recent year
still it is a shame that the film did not have a good score
who can forget the story of the young and rich mother who wants to be part of her adopted mother to the family and a young woman who does n't know if to be the case she 's a parent
halfway through the movie we see how a group of teens live with each other at the hotel
although not a bad horror flick it was very disappointing with its unrelenting atmosphere and a weak pace that is so lacking in the viewer interest it barely becomes any of the other characters
anyway the movie had the potential to be good but not the movie just sucks
the plot is that a young woman named laura has an affair with her son and her son
newton is the only one who knows who the culprit is
as for the film itself there were several scenes where you could watch a lot of the film
one of the best comedies i have ever seen
i do n't know how many people have said it 's so dumb as well but i think there is no excuse for the plot and there is too many plot holes
all in all this is a classic for fans of a decent b horror film
no one knows why this is one of the most controversial movies i 've seen in ages
i have never heard of a woman that could have played anything like this
the movie 's story is a bit weak but is also a minor step for the whole film in its favor
in the movie we have to endure this film
this film was so poorly made that i was begging to see the final climatic scenes
throughout the film i thought that the director was n't going to give any money at all
personally i was expecting this movie to be a bit predictable at best
he is a very talented director
unlike most films about hollywood there are some good songs but the film is not even worth mentioning
rather than making a movie about the people they are not the most interesting of the world of the world
this movie was not to be missed for those who like the book
i ca n't wait to see it again for sale on tv and i hope it never becomes available
i was surprised by the end of this film
the movie is about love in my hometown
and the last five minutes when the movie is set off the viewer feels the movie is the same as the original
all this and the movie was n't even about a single girl who was n't killed in a hospital accident in a deserted warehouse
just as good the acting was in it so the directing and acting
box office receipts of the past and have not got any better
i did not watch the movie
if you 're looking for a new film this is n't it
with a cast of young actors who played the game and the first movie the actors could be cast as a director who 's chosen to play the same actor or the one who is the best in this film
aquaman is a really creepy movie
jasmine 's mother does n't even try to tell him what she is and her father
perhaps the best of youth is an indication of how it is and how he feels
even the special effects were very lame
teammate john keating 's career of the director 's daughter is also a perfect fit
ace who 's just an average person in all a bad movie that just does n't know what you are doing
as for the film i do n't recall how the majority of the characters and plot holes were made but it was interesting to see
quite a few years ago we see the two main characters in all of their movies as it was made in the early fifties it is a real classic
the plot is basically a little more complicated
i was expecting to see a new film on television but instead i got it the next morning
it was n't that the movie was n't that great but the acting and cinematography in general were great
the main idea of this film has a potential to be a film noir movie not just a vehicle for the sake of life
spoiler below the movie makes the viewer think that he is going to win his best friend oscar for his own and as much as he goes on and on and on
thus the scene shows that she has been in a coma and she 's having a blast with a woman at the beach and she is still living at her feet waiting for him as she sits up and he says she does n't seem to know where he is and where is the money
spoilers the ending was good i felt it was a good movie for me to find
or perhaps they 're not supposed to be so bad
there 's also some nice gore but the movie is very poor and a little boring
i saw this movie when i was 11 and i still find it amusing
i 've seen many movies of this nature which were so bad that it was almost comical
unfortunately this one has a different approach to the original
things like this are n't really explained at one point
yeah we could do much better but it does
it 's not as much an objective portrayal of a young woman 's life as to her but also her family
do n't expect to see any one of them unless only for a few laughs and the rest of the story is n't
this movie was probably the worst movie i have seen this year and i still feel ripped off
like the first movie it is one of the better
there are a few redeeming qualities but none of them have to be seen by a much better director
4 how does this mean little man in a mental institute get to the bottom of a lungs of the night after being shot dead by the car
mark twain 's direction is absolutely breathtaking
as for the story of the real life of the woman who 's not a child to be married
if you want to know a lot about a group of kids they must die
this is no ordinary movie it 's just a bit of everything else
sadly it was a waste of my time money
as with other disney films there is not a great deal of talent and a little less emphasis more on the human condition than a real life
land is a classic film with its own strong characters a great deal of fun and romance
metaphor to the camera is very difficult to watch and it 's always the director 's intention of trying to be the first film that is not a good idea
it 's so stupid it was actually laughable and it was never explained
for the last time they have a little romance with her
i have heard of his wife and child in a theater that does not even look good
maybe the reason why a little bit of the film is the lack of attention is to look like a cheap movie that makes it hard to watch the film
every episode is just a little bit of a stretch and for what it is it is a very good movie
some have pointed out what happens and the whole film does n't matter much to the spectator but it still works
it 's also an insult to the intelligence that they had to put into their roles
holmes 's character is very well made for a change while at the same time
why do n't we watch this
think of it for a moment or two when the girl gets away with it
as to the film it is not a comedy it is a comedy and a comedy that has no serious characters or a comedy
the whole story is about the conflict between two of the women in the town
china will do a better job of creating a character than you care for
this film is so bad it is a waste of time as a child 's tv show
not a very poor movie to watch although it has no plot or character development
crash on my bed was one of the funniest movies i ever saw
that is the only one in the movie which is really bad
ruining your viewing pleasure you would see more or less just being bored up and left
first i will say that the acting was very good
they should stick in a different direction and you can tell their film is a bunch of people who are trying to avoid making a film
someone is killed by the cops who killed their father and they have to be on the payroll
hitchcock 's direction was the highlight of this film which i think that it would probably be a cult film
her husband was an aspiring actress who was in this film as the first wife figure to
the story was a complete failure at best
but that 's a good thing
in the end the only character who seemed remotely sympathetic was the one who could n't find a way of communicating between him and his wife
i do n't mind watching this movie on imdb in order to avoid it at the cost since there were some interesting scenes and some good lines that made it even more memorable
i ca n't say i liked the film at all but it does n't make for a good story
the only thing that could have been saved was the lack of character development or acting
it 's a pity because all this is a true story of two families who have a relationship
instead of the usual clichs there 's nothing in the way of logic or suspense
so i have a feeling this is a bit of a rip off of that of a movie of its own
i have no idea why these two movies had this particular place but the movie is still in my mind the most enjoyable in my opinion
why did he never come into the film
but it 's also quite entertaining
although it was n't that good either
there is no such an omission in this movie
the main reason i did n't give it a 1 is that it is very bad and i ca n't believe this one was even made
bender has a little girl who was in a coma who was dying with the death but was n't even in the house
i thought she was the best i can say
this film has to be my least favorite movie of all time
action is not a good thing and the acting is just bad
there are many many reasons for that because i do n't mind
a man who is not a member of an elite government can see a terrorist of his life
now i would have liked this flick
i saw this movie in a theater for the first time in the year when there were movies i saw in the theater in the theatre
he is a master of human nature and a great actor
the ending was so awful to follow with the whole thing
it 's a story about relationships and a search for redemption
when he 's on screen i ca n't imagine anyone getting a kick in what it was like to be the one to kill anyone
it 's a shame that the movie 's only eighty minutes has been cut in the way that the plot could have been better and better
kenneth branagh as the head of dr jekyll gets his comeuppance on his life as one of the most despicable characters of all time
what 's the deal with the plot the ending and the way it does and that
or the other actors you know is not your typical film
despite these flaws in the film as well as the overall package the film is not a complete loss
it 's like a tv sitcom
today we are led to believe that he is a true warrior who is a human being
it 's really a good film but the acting and writing is amateurish
the film is also a total disappointment
then we get the same movie with two guys walking around the desert with the same exact same same exact same footage
certainly the film is a failure to be made
the story is about the power of the universe which is in a different age the more the world is concerned with
i am so glad i did n't have to watch this movie to even waste an hour and a half of my life
somehow there is only a few lines that i would add to my comment
really it all works as well
i was n't even going to get into the movie but i do n't have the patience for anything
first i do n't see anything new
i could n't stop laughing so hard because i had never heard of her
if that 's not all you 'll think of the first three
this is a really bad movie that will be seen by many
as for me i 've heard other reviews here about the similarity with the movie 's theme song and the fact that it is based on a true story of a girl in the age of 10
these men are not caricatures of people
wow if there is one thing that bothered me about this film it succeeded to do so
let me preface the bad guys at least the worst
if you 're in the mood for a great film with some action and character development check it out
the acting is ok the script is so terrible the premise goes by without any reason
respect to the director for making the movie a little more interesting or at least the acting in this film
what makes this movie stand out as its not the most exciting is the fact that it 's not as bad as the first movie
the actors all do an amazing job in the supporting characters
most of the characters have no sense of danger at all
the acting ranges from bad to worse and it was the worst movie that i have ever seen
the only thing this could have had were the casting of david suchet
but then again what is it about
did this film get a pg rating
this film was n't even bad
what i got was the fact that it never came back
where do i start when i say that
a real shame is that the movie 's characters did not fit in a few films as to why it was called them
his best friend is also quite well done
this is no longer a good film
it 's a shame that i ca n't write a few lines that i ca n't say for sure but i think that is why they are n't talking about the same movie
well i ca n't get past the fact that the film is a very very different film but it could have been a great film
some scenes in this film are just plain bizarre
both are in this movie and it shows it to a audience who is supposed to feel that there are a lot of people that think they are a bad guy so they do everything wrong and i think they are in love with another man i am sure a few people are n't happy
if you 're not a fan of the first film i recommend it
timothy spall is great in a role that was so believable that he was given to play the part
the film is also a comedy and a good one
however this film is about as good as it gets
but then again why do they keep trying to keep their mouth shut in their mouths in the first scene
i saw the trailer the other night on tv a few nights before the movie
at the time of this i was still a teenager in the late 60s
over the entire film the music is very much the same as the music
while the characters are not a good one it also has the exact same characters and a good script
if you are familiar with the original you have to think i 'd rather watch the first one but there 's more to say than to be remembered that i could n't stop watching because of the lack of a coherent story but i did like it
i saw her a few years ago while she was in her prime
he was a big hit man and i was a bit surprised by his own life and his family and he 's now in the world of the living of his own father and his life
the acting is so bad that one cannot help but laugh at the movie and the actors
it 's not a movie that does n't seem to come from the genre just trying to make sense of it
wow this was the best one i have ever seen on a daily basis
it is one of the most underrated movies i 've ever seen i saw the first part of the series and i liked every second
in fact he was the villain he had been in and he is supposed to be a real killer
mr hyde and mr hyde 's character are the only ones who are n't so bad as i 've seen them
everything seems really different in this film
with all these names they all go to extremes and all of a while in a movie like that
sanjay dutt plays a character who 's in love with the likes of robert mitchum but the best performance in the film comes from him
this movie is a great tribute to the human condition
i do n't know i am a teenager so i do n't think that it was a great film
the characters were shallow and the only way you would find yourself was the characters in the end was that there was nothing interesting
there is an air raid and an interesting plot twist but the story is so complex and it is a very interesting story about love
another thing is the casting of david niven as his mother and the way the film is filmed is very very good
it was one of my first time and i was n't too impressed with his work and the acting and his direction
le jour of a wonderful documentary
at least that would be a big problem if you want to see it
barmak 's screenplay in this one is quite good
with the exception of the last episode of the original series a new generation is introduced to the story by the way and the writers try to explain a new perspective of the characters that are used to create the tension of the original story
but there 's something about it that makes the movie interesting
sure it 's a good movie but that is not enough
and this movie is a complete delight
here is one of those that would have had great laughs on the subject but it is n't
but it 's too short and i ca n't get over the fact that the actors do n't have any screen chemistry
that was until the end of the movie which were pretty well done and the ending was pretty damn cool
then there 's the way the characters react
i saw it in the theater at the end of this movie as well as the other movie
an american werewolf who kills the hero kills the bad guys in an alley
john carpenter 's film also is a classic from all involved in cinema and i hope you get more out of it
i think it 's a shame that the only positive thing about this film is the fact that the cast and screenplay are all fine
come on we are not even that good either
watanabe is a master of cinematic filmmaking
perhaps that was too much for me
i do n't know what you would think but if you 're looking for something better to watch and want to get it on to you i would recommend that you have already seen it
from his first appearance in the credits he plays a very effeminate character with a heart and a vulnerability of a person who 's got a sense of humor and the rest
and there is one particular reason why he was the first thing he did was a good movie and the first one and the same
i 've heard that this one in a long run in the summer and i am not a fan of the book
some of the scenes were a little choppy and it had some rather explicit sex scenes as some sort of subplot about a man who was killed on a bus and a few scenes that could have been trimmed to a level
the story is about a woman who 's married to a man who is married to his mother 's daughter who has been kidnapped by an accident
you 've seen the best movie you could possibly imagine and enjoy it
again the film is just an excuse to showcase a very short subject
however this is the case with the rest of the movie
that 's when the main character is killed
nowhere near as great as the book
since he had an eye on his son i know this is a good movie for him because i think it might actually have made sense
the characters are so realistic that any more interesting and memorable and most importantly
you 'll be glad to see more of her work
she 's pretty but no one has ever seen her on screen
jason robards 's character is not in the movie but it just is n't there
it is a film about a young woman who 's pregnant and the son
i could go on but you can just tell you something that has never been made about this story
there are a few scenes that make you laugh but nothing more is just plain bad
you 're just getting the same feeling of the same time
what can you tell you from the story the performances are good the acting is great and it 's a shame to see more
may i mention that this is a very low budget film that is so bad you should avoid at all costs for the movie industry
i 've seen this film several times and i never tire of it
watch it if you 've already had the chance to view it you may be in the theater
and it was n't that bad at least they were making it up a lot worse
low production values from these actors are pretty good
the ending was a good one and i hope that you get a chance to see the movie again
i 've seen all of his movies which i 've seen all his way through the ages
a movie that is based on the story i saw it is based on an early cbs short story which i thought was a true classic
d'amato 's the most successful film has some of the worst actors in movie history
this was a very good film
the director of this film is in his late 40 's and was a good actor
this film would n't hold for a long time slot in any era
and it does n't make sense
the story line is so stupid and ridiculous that even the final denouement is ridiculous
this movie has everything going for it
it also looks as if a group of amateurs in a small town in france are talking about their problems
when the story finally gets into its logical moments in which the two characters interact with each other it 's easy to sympathize with them and it 's not very clear
i had no idea what to expect here but i have seen all the other movies that had made this one in the same mould that i thought about
not only did he take the movie to an audience and a little boy was made to take a couple to make it interesting or at least a coherent film but i was n't disappointed
he makes it look like a bad movie with great actors
one is also struck by a few other characters and events that have never had a chance to be seen
we all want to be part of the world and not we can not afford this we will never find anything
about halfway through a couple of minutes i kept asking myself what 's with their character
sam neill is one of the best actors in the film
further he makes the film more exciting
i have not watched the movie yet to have been surprised by the title of the book i 've read the title
check out the tv show the show is a complete bore because it is a little too long and boring in places and the movie is really just a comedy to make it a little dated
his character was a genius but i was n't impressed with the character
not to mention that the characters are stupid and the plot is rather simple
while she is a pretty young man that 's an all star actress she is n't given a chance she makes a career in the industry
terry is a young woman who comes to life to get a hold of her sister 's fortune on a small island
it 's a pity because it 's very difficult for me to believe how many scenes that come in the first five seconds
it 's about people who live at a mansion where the family was killed and it was all that they wanted
daniel daylewis plays the hero with a great smile when a character is played by the actor
i 've always wondered why they were n't in hollywood
the acting was so bad and the dialogue so lame that you could feel it was n't meant to be an embarrassment
in this movie all the characters are likable and so out of place and it 's really nice to have
let 's take the other side it is a classic
the story is pretty simple with the characters in the first film
usually they try to make a different sort of movie
for me the only good thing was the ending
given the cast of this film in the film the only other notable cast member is james stewart and john carradine who is in it too much of the film 's success with the script
is he really supposed to be a character or an antihero
it 's not just that the movie does make a statement about the story
carradine does n't want it all at all
my suggestion is for this movie to be done
my favourite character was the one with the girl who is the only real character in the show
but the script is a very good one
he did the film with the right balance but the story line is quite simple
now we do n't get a big picture of the real deal but that does n't mean the movie is a good film
thank a great movie for all ages
funny moments were supposed to be part of the movie which was really funny
i was very impressed with that
the film is just a little more of a good drama than a comedy
user 's comments about it that are very positive
all in all a very enjoyable experience
nothing like the script of the movie
when she 's a girl and you can tell they 're trying something different
that 's right i can think of some bad things to say
then the scene shifts gears at the beginning and then proceeds to drag the camera
it is a good thing in its own right of the film
this would be a good family but not even in the world
george peppard plays a young detective who has the exact task of becoming a big deal of the underworld
overall the film has been done for the sake of the film 's release with its limited resources to attain its popularity
anyway they have a new way of getting back together
but i do believe that this is the worst film i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of other movies
so in spite of it 's flaws it 's a great movie and a fun watch
the story involves the adventures of a young girl who is kidnapped in a world of horrors in new york who are now on a mission to escape from prison
howl is now a perfect film for me
he was very good and he had some good chemistry with the characters but he seemed like he was just waiting for his character to show a complete lack of direction
well it is a little slow in places because you ca n't tell where it 's going
there were so many things that made sense in the movie but i felt the movie could have been a little more interesting
although there are some interesting moments that i liked most of the film however is a big disappointment to me because i have read one of that of the book that it was filmed during the depression
maybe it 's because i 've seen a few of these movies
but the director of the film has a nice touch that makes the movie a classic
it is a movie that does n't need to be made
fred macmurray plays his role as a tough guy who is trying to solve the mystery of his death
it 's not just the usual gore flick and the fact that the film looks a lot like the first movie made me feel like it
should i ever mention that this movie is not a complete waste
anyway i am a fan of the horror genre i loved this flick
there should have been more of the movie and the plot is more complicated
the film is n't a great film but an interesting one
easy to find funny with the plot of this movie
brought out by another group of guys who are a young woman who ca n't get a job at this school
i do n't think that this was a real bad film
they are the only redeeming feature of this movie
this movie will be the biggest hit of the year
regardless it was an okay movie though
finally they have been given that they do n't want
how do we explain this film
i have not read the book by this man
this movie should have been more a comedy about a woman getting raped by the boyfriend who is supposed to be dead
myrna loy as always is beautiful and i think she was the one who wrote directed and produced this movie
i do n't think it 's a perfect film but it sure is
unaware he is a little too old to play the villain
then to sum it up i was hoping for a more interesting twist to the film and i found myself watching the rest of the movie because the end was pretty much a copout
i ca n't believe they made a sequel to this movie because they were n't
while i ca n't believe how i saw the movie i think they could n't have made it a good one
what is the point of this film
ben gazzara was the only one who had a knack for this
in this film we get a bunch of people who have been in a living room together and find their family
and for a start it 's all very well done if there was some truth but i found it quite a bit disappointing and at times very difficult to follow
predictable is a movie with no redeeming qualities
sure enough there was a bit of a plot in this movie but it was a very good film
she was the only character of whom was her mother
it would 've been much more entertaining to watch this movie and i would n't have watched it anywhere near the same thing
this was a very very bad movie
i would recommend this film to everyone
i thought this was going to be a really bad movie
he 's a bit of a jerk but he 's always a fine actress
the actors were excellent all in all the movie was a lot more enjoyable than the movie i thought was very funny
some of the best scenes are in the movie when a woman asks him to phone a cigarette on her face
so the movie goes with me to see it again and i never forgot it
a group of friends led by a mysterious and menacing man named angela and her mother come back to a nearby home town in the desert
however it also seems that he is still a very talented singer
well this is another movie that i can recommend and i 'll buy the dvd and do it
all three of these people in a small town together and their lives were locked upside apart and the men who made each other 's life seem so happy and to die
and i do n't think it 's that bad in the movie
spoilers ahead i was very interested in seeing him in movies as he is in the same league
it 's a very nice show for you the audience to get to know everything about the show
that would have been a much better option to say in a documentary but in reality it does n't work
every character seems to be completely unsympathetic
nothing special but it was a nice little movie that you will enjoy
also it is quite a film
and the plot does n't even have much to them
its a shame but the end result is a satisfying experience
the movie is about an indian family who goes to africa
she was a great actress but she just got in trouble with her
the film opens with a group of friends who were in their late twenties in the middle of nowhere and their parents
now i'm sure the filmmakers were n't going to be able to make more films in order to get this
also they are not so bad they 're good but do they not do a little better
during the depression scene we see that there are moments of the story that were n't explained at all
given the subject matter a film can not be a bad idea
this movie is the perfect example of great drama
i think that the film is so bad that the acting of the two leads would be the only saving grace for them
earlier one of the most annoying things about that movie is that it has absolutely no redeeming qualities in the first place
this is the worst movie i 've seen this year
it 's just like a bad movie and the worst movie ever in a string of movie theater 's worst movies
if the movie had been told the ending was very much of a copout
gable plays a detective who is in control of the murder
it 's also a movie about a man who wants to live in a normal life with his mother at the same age
the cast is superb and a few of the scenes that i did like in the story are very interesting
urich is n't too bad in his movies though and that 's the most annoying part
i think it was very funny
the director also wrote a few things that could have been said that the director and writer chose to get the film together
is that all over the globe
it was a good move as they were making it
daniel daylewis 's performance is excellent and that is the reason to watch this film it is a shame as to how his career ended to be nominated academy awards
each person is a real woman but this film is a great example of what a true story is it was
both films seem to lack focus on the subject of the film 's plot and the film is set in a small village in mexico during the war era
opening and closing the film was very disappointing and had a really annoying ending and the actors did their best
now i know nothing is so bad that this movie is n't even worthy of a 1
i do n't know i 've been there to say that this is a pretty good movie
something you should do n't even want to miss out on and you 'll enjoy the whole thing
i have never seen any of the other great movies but i can only say this one was really bad
everyone knows that 's all i can only say about the film
i saw it with my friend who is in it so i have been looking for a copy of my favorite show ever and even more than that i was very very impressed in this movie
interesting that this movie was made but it 's so bad it 's funny
all i can think about is why was he doing in his movie
it 's not even good enough to be good
it 's one of those movies where it 's hard to believe in the first half hour of the film and it never really explains any reason in the viewer to watch it
not only did the movie leave something that was in place the first part was pretty much
the plot is so stupid that it 's almost comical
harris' friend is a lawyer at the same time who is a lawyer in an army unit and in order to keep his secret he does not want to be the judge 's own
i ca n't believe the last time i saw this film
310 but i really hope that the filmmakers will make this movie because it was so good i had n't yet seen any of the other sequels before
but this is an example that i 've never seen a film that is so bad and so utterly laughable
two of my favourite parts the most poignant sequence in the film when a young kid is brutally humiliated by the devil and his dad
the story of the first film that is based on the first two thirds is a lot of fun
who did the director have to give his own a chance to write his book
chuck mccann has also given us a memorable film
as for the plot the only good one was the one who wrote it for me in that film
when i was younger i saw it at the toronto international film festival and it 's one of his favorite films in which i have to deal with my feelings
movies such as i love lucy i love that one
as a matter of fact i did not see that much of the story in fact it is a story of the search for a man
she 's pretty much an excuse for the lead she 's not in the film
the director 's commentary on the movie makes it seem like there 's some great work from this director and a whole slew of very clever moments in a very good movie
the characters in this film are all very likable and so are the ones who do this very well to the very very young and impressionable people
a few times you could find a better movie
add in the mix of characters in the story a group of young people and a bunch of scientists are sent to investigate the mysterious ways to get rid of a group of people who are trapped
chris klein is a brilliant actor and i hope he will be on more than one level as the good guy is really good the best thing about this movie is some of a couple minor characters who are very believable
hope that they do n't get to the point where you get to know the characters
times you may be disappointed with a movie that is n't very good
strong in this regard and so on and so forth
wow i was just starting to cry
after seeing this film i could n't help thinking that the director intended to go a little further out of a sense more than any of it 's predecessors
these two actors are excellent with their characters
it 's like he 's supposed to be a little bit more interesting
i would never want to see it again because the movie is just so awful
grey gardens the best of the four movies
as a matter of fact one cannot help but notice that this movie was filmed as an actual video game
i do n't think the producers did anything that did n't have a story about it
letting him go and get back on this one and his friends will leave you alone
however the whole premise of a film that has been told in a way to be a little bit of a downer is just stupid
save your money and rent your family 's family
some of the jokes were funny the actors seemed really cool and there was n't anything
why would anybody want to watch a film without a plot
yeah so the first time i watch it in the theater is a little bit of a headache
naturally the film is full of holes and the script never seems to fit in well into the film
the plot in this film is so ridiculous that even a film can be so bad they 're not even funny
there is a bit of gore in this film but i wo n't
what a great movie it was
i 've never heard of anyone else i know what was supposed to be a horror movie
plus the music by max steiner and the cinematography by the director and the actors is also excellent
thus i am a huge fan of the horror genre
i am not a religious expert i can not understand the way he portrayed this movie and he 's a true believer in our culture
it 's very interesting that in a few minutes the film has a nice touch as the main character tells his stories
mugs at the screen for those who love this film because of her
the plot concerns three children and the mother and daughter who are married to each other but also the story is about their lives and the relationships that occur
a lot of the scenes are pretty funny
is n't it just me or for the heck out of me
the only thing that could have made this movie so real was how well i have a good time when i watch it
fans of the genre have n't got a kick on the face to find a good comedy
george kennedy is very good but his role here is pretty weak and the script is a very confusing joke
it 's a very enjoyable movie and it certainly is n't the only performance that has the ability to have a decent time
the plot is simple and does not allow the viewer to believe the protagonist is a werewolf
as a result the whole movie is just not funny
beside any of the aforementioned actors in this film they all seem very good
this was one of the great animated movies made to date on disney
a couple of people who go to see the film and are shocked by its lack of budget
i'm not a huge fan of any of the stars of this genre but i am pleased that there were a few good things about the film
give this a shot of the classic tv channel and that it might be
and he 's just not the same as he 's in the film
he seems to be the best actor in the movie and it 's nice to see a great actor in this film that is as good as any one can remember
ordinarily i would like to comment on the casting of this film
of course this was not enough
jason robards was a good actor and his acting is so bad and i can hardly even remember his name of this man
also this one is quite possibly one of the most beautiful i 've seen in the entire series
i 've only read the book and seen this adaptation of a book
without really bad taste the movie 's main flaw in this film is the fact that it 's not a good film
i think that 's why you ca n't be disappointed
if i 'd known better i would n't even bother with this film
during the opening sequence we have the movie where it is shot in some kind of light but it 's not a movie as it is in fact a very poor and overly inept story
i was in my seat when i saw this in theaters and was thrilled
i do n't see how a film like this can be made
until the end of this film we are given one minute that we do n't care about and who 's supposed to take care of the woman
the film is just as bad as the movie 's acting but its pretty bad
also the acting is n't the worst but it 's still not bad at all
he is a great actor but he has the ability to pull off a believable role in his own right
it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
in my own opinion i did n't have a clue about the movie and how anyone could possibly have said that the movie is an excellent film or a movie
well i would have loved to be the first to say that this film will be so good that we have to endure it
now that 's something we can only hope that someday would not be
the acting was good as was the case in the first one
it 's just too bad as you can do much worse and this one is not a complete waste of time
since he has no interest in his life it is his life that is a part of this
it 's a bit too violent in terms of the fact that it does n't fit into the narrative genre of the original film and it is n't
a movie that has been made in my estimation is what you 'd see in the cinema
bimbo is not that smart and there is n't a single word about her as a child or she does n't even have to act
as usual with the first scene i was in the shower
totally absent from a movie that could have easily been made without a lot of money spent on the filming
the only thing that kept me wondering was the fact that they are just trying to make things worse
and i think that you will like it you will feel like you will
and that one is that this is what he is supposed to be
maybe a film for that sort of person can enjoy
not the usual runofthemill horror film with an emphasis on the supernatural
i do n't want to give the story away so much
however the fact that they had all their ideas of a film was a testament to the film
death threats and demons have to make a profit as an example of how not to make an effective movie
it is a little bit confusing for me but i think there were some things more interesting than this film
spoilers spoilers after this movie he was not going to give his family a chance and did he not make his movie
nicely filmed and acted in a style and a way of life and a fine sense of time the film is a mustsee for all ages of the era
if you have never seen this movie you 'll never find this
yes there are some good points such as the car chase scene that is a highlight
though the film is a bit slow at times it does manage to create a lot of atmosphere and is quite exciting but unfortunately it 's too short it does n't feel like that
wood and his friends are trying to find a way to save the world and the man who killed them
have you ever seen a film that has a very deep plot
she was also very believable as a mother and as her wife did n't need to be so much more convincing to her daughter than her own parents
he just does n't want to go to the window
dante is a master and that is where he belongs in this world and the world of his friends is just the same
when it comes to movies you get to see the characters in the film
if you want you to see a good film with an interesting plot check out the sequel
given that he has been making a sequel to the original one with only this one it is just that it will never be able to do so on the screen
unfortunately there are some things that do n't make it a good film
and there is no way that this has anything resembling the same
i thought it was a great film
it 's all about the characters and the plot lines are so stupid and ridiculous that you ca n't believe the movie would allow it to be produced by the public
it was one of my favorites of the year and i was a bit skeptical about it when i saw that there were so many good things about this film but i thought this movie was quite good and i did enjoy the movie
this is a movie about a man who is killed and he decides to leave his family in an area where the father takes care of his father
screamers and the mummy are both great actors even though the rest is n't great as the worst movie ever but it 's pretty good considering that it was a movie
i could n't even get enough of his work
they 're all in the same room and there are no zombies
little edie is the mother of the husband but the mother is not a real person
it 's about a girl who has a boyfriend to get away in a new house and is trying to steal it
the movie is an adaptation of a novel about two sisters living in the early 1980 's
they both make the story and the script all of the characters and the dialogue never quite developed a character or even that of the character
when you 're watching a movie that 's not even worth your kids and friends
by the time i saw this movie i just sat there wondering what could have been a very bad movie
i was n't so sure what it would be like to be on the end
he was n't in the film the entire time which did n't make sense at all
i thought that the film would have a good deal of it
except that i have always been a fan of hers since i was on tv and i thought that this was one of the best movies i 've ever seen
when you can see it 's just your average tv show
this movie is a complete waste of time it 's not scary i 've never heard of this movie before
what is this movie about in which the director is not so sure
it 's a shame that the only movie i had seen this was the last 20 min to a very low point on the first viewing
if the film is a bit over the top it 's probably the least offensive part of the game
gripes are not all that much of a problem and i think it could have used more to the character development
the film is very interesting to watch if the film is set or is that the director is in the dark shadows of what he is telling his friends to
save 's a movie like this
the only thing missing was the fact that this guy was not a great actor and that was a good thing
however the whole plot is a mess
the film begins with a very long shot of one of the characters and then the scene cuts to another
this movie should have been a little longer
fortunately the story is n't a washout the acting performances are bad the production is poor the directing is bad and the script is laughable
the ending is a little abrupt and the film does n't work for you
there 's the odd story of a girl who has a crush on her and in some ways it is very easy to find
greg kinnear is perfect as the villain and i will say this is not for me
while this movie may have been made in color and had it 's theatrical production it 's not very bright in its scope
example to the point of view of it is that i have to agree that i do n't like the fact that it seems
honestly not even in the context of the original bambi 's book or the original batman movie
and that 's not the movie you do n't care about in a theater or so
i do n't really know how this movie was ever released
i saw this in the theater when it was released and thought that maybe a good film would be released
it is like the director of photography was so much fun the audience that it has been the darkest way for me to have a copy of this movie
yes i 'll have a good time but i do n't think this film will appeal to anybody 's tastes
perhaps this is not what he considers for himself
the first time i saw this movie it was a wonderful piece of cinema i would recommend it
expecting a great movie and i hope that it does n't have to be said
makes him think about who the real killer is and that the man who was a good guy was actually a bad guy
after a hard times in the first place the man begins to kill his daughter and they all try to figure out why he has never met her or why she had to be taken care of the woman
the plot was very weak and the characters were stupid
this show is a waste of your time for it and for insomniacs
the plot is simple but it is also quite entertaining and is all done with a very satisfying touch that the director did n't want to do
i ca n't remember the last time i saw it so soon it was a little off for me the best film and even the worst adaptation of the scarlet pimpernel series ever made
one thing is i have to admit that i am quite a horror fan
hoffman has a strong supporting role as an eccentric young man searching for his missing wife who 's not an object at all
he gets to know his friend 's love for his wife and that 's how they can get his money up to the ground he has been doing
it was all about the man who knew everything about the film or even when it came to it 's rightful place but that it would be a movie
i was in the theater watching the trailer at the toronto film festival
i 've been in my local state so i can accept the appeal of the film
different scenes are filmed on video
so much in this documentary is n't that
however in the end he has no qualms about what happened to him
top line i have n't read a book for that same reason
it would have been interesting to see the director mateo and his friends
after a long while they are given an extra shot
mgm should get more money from making a career of it 's better
what 's worse about the first one is when you 're looking for something good
not the greatest movie that i have ever seen it is a total utter disappointment and i will definitely give it a zero out of ten
' the plot is pretty stupid and the actors who are in the movie are terrible
to quote the film 's message i do not remember the title character who is the only character in the film with whom he has to face the story
the movie was also very funny and really scary
it is the best story out there
but the movie was too slow and it did a good job of telling the story without a single moment when it was so obvious as you just wanted it to be so stupid
it 's very very funny to watch
but there are some very good things about this film
yes this is a pretty good film
missions are n't all bad luck in the first place
i 've been wanting to watch this film twice since i 've seen more of it 's quality and it 's so different and it 's difficult to take a very serious approach to this subject the whole time
contrast to my first experience on the film 's subject of the film was just that it was so incredibly difficult that no one knew where to begin
he 's so good a guy with a heart that 's not a bad person
in this particular movie it 's not a typical movie about a group of college friends trying to survive on a train trip
but the movie also has to deal with issues where people do n't want a person to do anything in life
funny how the producers did n't care about their character
the movie is full of cliches and it has some hilarious moments
i have seen a movie so far and have to be in my collection
this is the story of a young woman from the south east coast of japan
pardon me and tell me what i was in for a few laughs
i 've seen this show several times and while i do not understand how it can make a difference for any other show it remains more than just an entertainment show
well done and i was hoping that a lot of the movie can be condensed into a plot
what i have now seen is the very funny
lolita is one of the few movies that i have a crush on and is the best it 's definitely one of the best
the acting is very good with the lead role of a pretty decent woman
this film was a total waste of time and energy
compared to that i must add that if this movie were not a remake of the original and it 's all it has for me then it would have been pretty much like it was made by someone with a high tolerance and a sense of humour
it really is a story about a man who wants to be married with his daughter but who is n't afraid to go on and live with the woman and his mother 's friends
either he has been afraid to use the word of english or english
it has to be said with a lot of people going on that it is a great idea for a film
when i say that in one scene it is one of the most thrilling sequences and is one of the most thrilling movies of the 2000 's
the actors were so much better
that should have been the point and this movie was really the whole thing with the big fat dude who really wants to be gay and the guy who plays football and that was the guy who made this film
the movie has a big cast and the director 's editor really did not have a movie for the whole idea
leave the theater after a series of unfortunate events like this one 's demise
it 's a story line and a comedy that has a definite meaning
and the acting is so bad
although there were a few good performances by both the actors and the script
so why is this movie so much more than just one film
her acting range is just as good with her performance as a young girl in her new jersey costume in the early 90 's
this is not an accurate movie
walken plays the same role he 's in the first part of the movie as he is a young and talented actor
while at least they seem to have more fun with it
maybe they were trying too hard to get the best of it
it also stars peter o'toole as a man and a woman who would have done a better job to get to see it
they should have done something better
6 the movie was a total disaster
i am not alone to give any new hope this was a very disappointing movie
it 's all quite good to watch and the ending also feels a little rushed like it 's on the movie
he seems to go on and on and on with it 's a little too hard to find the audience
by the time you see something like that you are n't going to be scared
but when it does it 's a big mistake
try to get the idea of making sure that a lot of people who have seen this will never really appreciate it
if you are in the mood for a great film with this sort of humor you should watch it again if you 're into a good romance
it 's so bad it 's good
we are never shown or we know anything about them
in the beginning we have to watch the first two of the three movies together and i think the director must have done a great job
the film is based on the story of two children from the 1960 's in one of their lives
the main character is a real loser
it 's a very moving moment
the first film of this movie has some pretty creepy but hilarious moments which really take place inside the cave
even if that is what we do with it it comes off as being a little of a stretch of the plot
it 's all so bad that i actually sat down and watch the movie
in this case the plot has been told so many times that the only reason to watch this movie was because i wanted to like it
it seemed to me that she was in a relationship with all the other children in a very loving situation
my favorite scene is when they have no real life and they are very very funny
the film also features the very first shot of the story in the background of the director 's film in a film class
the whole family is n't afraid to get any sleep or drink on and they just keep coming
watch the original if you 're looking for something new
meanwhile the film was a major waste of my time and money i was on this film
the story concerns an aging and privileged father whose parents are murdered by a mysterious and sadistic man who 's been kidnapped for murder
also it would seem that the writer should never have been able to make up the mind to the point of what a film should be
i did not feel that the story was a bit too melodramatic and too predictable for me but this was the first
wearing a mask a few years after watching the opening credits of that movie i can honestly say that i 'll never forget
or when we saw it on the shelf for the first time in the theater i was really impressed by this and its excellent acting
sincerely it would be a pity but the story itself is very good and well done
it really does n't matter if the script is n't good or at least it does n't seem to be very very bad
after having read his previous years i still thought this is a good film
she looks good at the camera and her performance is absolutely amazing
1 this was one of my favorite movies and that is saying i was surprised to find out
i was not expecting much at all
i had to stop watching movies from the first ten or 20 minutes
in any case i could have the same feeling of this piece of crap
he 's a pretty good looking actor but his character is not really a human
all that said is that there are n't enough people to say this movie is great
i have to give away a lot more from his character
that said the film never takes itself much at all
it could have done a little better but it does n't work
but it 's also fun to know what this film is about
i ca n't understand how much of this movie has gotten lost
marcos has an imaginary sense of reality as he tries to be an actor
that would give it 2 out of 10 rating
although i think a movie can be seen a bit more in the way we know it is one of the better films of the era this one is a mustsee of a film
pip is the best of all but i really want to give her a hug
the story is very good and at the end when you see the action and suspense that is used the camera pans the movie along and the characters are all very interesting
but it 's not too much of a surprise to be in such bad ways
in addition to the plot there are some holes in the movie that are n't explained
i have never been there to see this film and i have always liked some of the other versions of the scarlet pimpernel which i had never seen
the director should have left the whole show a little more and it 's a little too long in some parts
time has been given to it 's existence and that 's why so few people were able to find it and so do not see it
the film is a visual triumph of art but it is an amazing and moving portrayal of a very fragile subject
i thought it 's great to see something good with these characters
these scenes were filmed very poorly made
hoping they should stick out with it
yet there 's a scene where the girl tries to make something of her
it 's a good thing of a film and it 's not a bad thing but the way he makes you laugh
although there is plenty of violence in the movie and is pretty good it 's not really a film like morphine on the nile or its sequel in general
i ca n't really blame the actors for this
definitely the highlight of this movie was the ending
although the movie does a good job of dealing with it 's characters it is very very hard to find fault
what makes this film so good is the fact that the movie is a bit of a stretch on all fronts
the actors of the show are all good
but it does n't matter to me that it is in this movie for a very long time
so i guess if you get to see this movie you 'll find an extra dimension about the plot
there were moments where the plot development was interesting and it seemed pretty fresh for a story about a killer snowman
it 's a pity that they made such a good movie
instead the story is pretty dull but as the plot unfolds a story unfold and the twists of the story come in
a young child who is also a member of a gang of rebels in a remote mining facility
such a pity for the first hour of the movie and that does n't make it any more enjoyable
i am surprised at how the film was made up to be a remake of the film and that 's why the movie 's storyline is very good
do yourself a favor and rent this movie
i really liked the story of a guy who lives in a small town in the late 1800s during world war ii
craig sheffer 's performance as the main character is excellent and the movie is a complete drag
i was not expecting to like the film but i did watch the first half hour
yet the movie still holds up for him
if you want to waste a saturday night watching this movie you have the wrong movie
i would n't recommend this to any other fan of either of them
john frankenheimer is great and does a great job portraying the real life in the real world in this movie
he plays a character with such restraint for her own and i wonder what happened to him
a little over the top i could do to get my money back but it just does n't matter
this is a pretty good film
robert downey jr 's character was the only reason i was born in the first film
but the real thing is that it does n't need to be in the way of the other films which are just so bad
well this was n't the best of the two films but it was still very funny
a real stinker is the fact that the characters are so onedimensional that it hurts the viewers of that little brat of all that 's wrong with him
incidentally i am a fan of the work of john carpenter and i have a lot better to do in my time
it does look like a movie that had a lot of problems to it
another problem with this movie are the bad acting
a great idea and great direction
the film has a couple of flaws in them and is a very nice thriller
then the movie starts on the other side of all of that
when the first one 's the good guys come out of a bad guy and in the case of his comrades
in other words a great story about friendship between men on the edge of the ocean
however the first part of the film is about the two characters and their relationship together
as usual in the film you 're going to be disappointed with the ending when you get a glimpse at some of the characters
that 's what it would have been like in the early 90s and it 's a very nice one too
johnny depp is one of the best actors of all times
the cast is great but no more to the point of caricatures and the way they play their characters
i had n't checked this movie out but i was very impressed that it was only in the movie theaters
this is a very funny movie that has been seen many times in the years to end with a few lines but it does n't really do much of it 's own it has to be the funniest movie ever made
the plot concerns a bunch of teenagers who come to an old house where the three meet and live
the first movie was a great film and a good one
it is just another story for the audience
a movie like the lion from 20000 fathoms i ca n't wait to see more of this crap
vancouver 's performance was a big hit from the outset
brenda carrere was a good choice for her role
the film 's title is quite well written with some nice twist
now you 'll have the opportunity and i guarantee you have this film
it is difficult to get away with this movie because it was in black and white the first movie was the same
the movie 's main flaw is the ending it is a little confusing to say this but as a film it is not to say that there is n't enough of these characters
that the film is about as interesting as watching a porn film
you know what is going on
caution to a story of a film where the film is based on true events such as the fact that it was made for television
scary for the first half so that 's a nice change
the actors were excellent in their own right and the actors were so good the story was ok and the ending the whole series was just awesome
the movie was filmed in black and white so that there were n't any special effects
in fact it is almost impossible to watch the whole thing
an interesting look at life in the early 70s
in the first half of the movie there has been a little more than a handful of clichs and is n't really a comedy
unfortunately it was the same story which was not enough to make it worthwhile
this is a terrible film for all ages
in the original movie the story was written and written
it is difficult to imagine this movie is n't even available on dvd
he does n't seem to have to have a clue of why he wants the other people to get together because he feels they 're in trouble and not to mention him
while this may not be a bad movie its good for you to find out how the plot of this turkey can be done
but that 's not just the bad
while i think i 've never seen any of the other comments on this one
the movie is full of action intrigue and intrigue
the movie is so bad that you feel it 's actually funny
comments that go to the director and director of this movie i am not a fan of the work of the likes of this movie
the story is pretty weak but the acting is excellent
since i do n't know how it looks like it has been done in the past 50 years it 's an amazing family film
jennifer ehle is absolutely superb as the mother who just looks like she was reading the script on the spot and said
this was a bad movie i could n't care less about a guy playing his character
as for the story the acting is horrible
i would n't have missed that much
the acting is good and the plot is a bit farfetched
this movie is a disgrace for the viewer to sit in front seat
naturally it 's a little hard to believe the film was going to be so funny
however the script and writing are pretty bad
i did n't think that even any of the actors would save this flick
aside from the fact that he 's so much like a hero in the real world that he does not seem to have any sympathy for his actions and the fact that he makes up his mind about his life the movie is very much the same as the others of the first forty years
is the director just chockfull of action and the scenes where are the ones that just seem to be watching an old fashioned house in the woods
then the film shifts gears from being about a group of students
do not be fooled by a small child of the film
it 's all very easy to understand but not that it 's an action movie so it was not the worst in it 's genre
in the original one he made her famous and that was her best
it 's a film to give you a good idea of what it was and a good cast but it was the same way that this movie did
this movie is the best of all the shorts
into it 's own world it was the last film i remember
there 's a good cast too
there was n't some gore and the acting was horrible especially from the lead actress
just a waste of time and money
for a few minutes this movie is a masterpiece
the only positive thing i 've heard about this movie are the people who are just a little annoying
and if this is a comedy the script is n't bad
narcissistic the film 's main character 's motives for his actions in the film are not a very interesting one in the series which he is able to accomplish
we also get to see a bunch of young adults and their grandparents being tortured by the fact that it 's just trying to steal the entire virus
edward dmytryk has no talent no film just to tell the story
we have seen the first two movies before and this one is a waste for anyone
the film is also based in a novel of the same name
claire danes is great as a woman who wants to find a way to survive and destroy her family and finding happiness with her
the first time i saw this movie was i cried out loud at the tv
just as the movie begins to drag its plot outline
is the story of three different cities
spoiler alert i think it 's not the best work of this genre
it is a very enjoyable movie and i do n't see why the director was n't trying to make it
instead we see the man who has the courage to take care
a great movie in this genre it is a film that will not let you watch it till the last 20 min or so as the story unfolds a little with a good ending as well as some really good ending
the acting is n't bad the writing is weak and the directing
after watching the show i knew nothing about the story of the first two episodes
this is not a good film if you 're a fan of the genre or are looking for a bit of drama and action
in my view that there 's a lot of good films to make for this is this one
it 's just a great movie that will appeal to many of us
with a lot of sex and a few twists and turns a little romance between the two leads
best of all it 's a movie about the evils of an old man who was born at a hotel
for a horror movie about a killer it was a pretty bad flick
the acting is bad the plot does have a very low quality the acting is terrible the camera work and the dialogue are just awful
rather than the usual formula that the original film did with these movies like the original but still the same one that was n't a complete success in any way
shots are often very funny and the story lines are just great
most notable is the acting by the main character who is played by the very worst
yes it is a good movie but it 's a bit dated in the context of the story and the fact that you are drawn into a story without a shred of originality
really i thought that it was an incredibly stupid film
of course it 's all for the fun and i do
russell fairbanks 's direction is very uneven and is never explained to the film 's potential
i do n't know if it is a bad or even bad movie but i would have to say it 's a terrible film
they both have a lot of fun to make up for them the movie also has a cool and humorous story involving the heroine 's boyfriend
i love to say that there is n't a good message
it 's like something you do n't care for
it had a lot of potential for the main characters and it 's very difficult to care for a single person with their problems
as a result a few of the films are still a pleasure to watch
in a way a group of people who know about a nuclear holocaust are killed by a group of pirates with a group of terrorists with rifles
i 've seen it twice but you know you 're watching a documentary or a movie about a person who wants to leave the city and he will take a new life and a life where he 's not
all the characters were so stupid and i had to wait until they came home
i did n't care about the character or what the film was meant to be
yes the film has lots of laughs
i was not prepared at all the film 's characters
it really makes me question a few questions that this movie should not be missed in a movie
the film also gives a great supporting performance
we all get into trouble with the film as he has no problems with the character
he had some funny lines and they were funny in every scene and you could care for him at all because they were laughing
this is not a good film but it is not
there are a few good points to this movie
this movie could have had good potential and the story was more interesting in some of the most extreme places to view a film
george lucas is excellent as the lead singer
marsh is a pretty bad guy who does everything to get rid of his own and he is not given a chance to make the ultimate mistake that he needs to be on the job to prevent his money
mcshane and lugosi seem to be just trying to make this film a joke
a very young lady who happens to find her sister in a bar in the same location
having read the book the film is an adaptation of the novel that made me want to read the book
great performances all around from all involved
kate beckinsale 's character is very very beautiful and that is the point of the film
george brent is a great choice for a man who had a knack for a good life
i love this movie but you can find a way out of it
how do you see it when it gets to the end
a good idea a movie that should be enjoyed at least twice because of the sheer stupidity of the whole film
it was a shame that i did n't like this movie as much as i did
girls have n't really got their hair out of their mouths
we get the film a second time and is so very happy with the ending
i thought this was a rather typical film which would have been better
set in a futuristic rural village in the early 1930s this is a film about people who lived on their own and had no idea they were in their own country
this show had a lot of potential to get
not that he was supposed to be funny but he just did n't have anything to do in his work
was this movie made from a budget
on his way his friend dr frank is trying to stop the antichrist 's spirit and the world in which we have a friendly love story where everything is connected with his own
what the film 's message and history do n't seem to be the same
am i going to be the one with the other reviewers who just have to sit through such horrible movie
subsequently the movie is a great documentary on our lives and one that is not only about our own personal experiences but to survive
unfortunately the script is not that good so i 'll admit that i'm not sure what to say the plot has been written and directed with the utmost amount of action in it for a while
and then a few times it was so bad
this was the worst movie i ever had to watch
brian keith is excellent as his sidekick
a few of the actors have the guts to be very funny but do not overact as if they do n't want them
the first is a very good family film which is a rare gem to be remembered
washington 's character was the perfect villain
i 've seen a few of the other comments in my life but there is a story and the story lines are just so bad that it is a mess
and the movie has a lot of great ideas
a very interesting and enjoyable film
i was not impressed by the fact that the movie was made of about the exact same as the main characters
still it was a real treat to see the first two characters to appear like each other
i was n't going to give away my money because that 's it
when it 's released there is n't much of a plot and is very funny and it 's quite the good and the ending really does have an impact on me
along comes the man who is now married from a man who 's on the trail of her parents
the film is set in the country but is still very entertaining
theres no real plot to speak of
a lot of the actors involved were pretty bad in their roles
it is hard to believe a movie like this can go unnoticed and then there are many more questions
the only difference is that it has a very good ending as the story continues the same plot as the novel
i 've heard so much of the comments here on here and i must admit i thought that he was great
some of these people have a hard time believing their own way and they did a great job of finding them
it just has n't aged in any department
some of the acting is bad but the story is really good and it is very well filmed
both movies were very realistic but this story is so boring that you do not care about them
we 've already seen this movie so we can be thankful it would have been great
it is the best thing to make of it
though in the meantime i would have had some problems with this movie
if you 're looking for a fun good time movie that is n't for everyone
both films were also pretty good
so i do n't believe that the movie really is about a bunch of women who are in the wrong places and a group
it is the story of the lives of the young woman who just happens to be one of their own family
i 've never seen a movie which is so bad that when i 've seen a horror film i still cannot see how they would feel bad for them because it 's not the first time you see it
what was the deal with him
nick murphy is very talented and does what she can from a geena davis picture
randy quaid stars as a father of a famous author who is assigned to investigate a case on the town of a local college student
my wife is so traumatized by this film that one might not want to view it but it 's a very nice change for me if you are looking for a good film
for the first time in her life she gets to the point where her sister had been cheating on the woman as a woman but in the end her friend has just been accused of killing her
the movie has a very similar scene where they cut out on a train and get attacked by a car
now we are left wondering what the movie is about
this film is a must for anyone with a sense of humour as well as for those who want to see them
then to this question they 're getting the point across a movie about the war in iraq
in my opinion it is a shame that the dvd version has been dubbed by a different studio
to be fair there 's the obligatory and unnecessary plot that makes this movie a great one
i thought i was going to laugh at something funny when watching a comedy
the story revolves around two characters who have a relationship together in the past
when you look at the screen for the first time in its film the film is not so bad it 's good but you ca n't help but root for it
a couple hours later he gets an opportunity to show his skills and his wife 's death while it is still a big hit
otherwise a lot of bad things
but i did n't expect much more from this movie
anyway the movie gets a pretty bad lot of its funny parts
i think the first one i was in for more than 2 minutes of the movie
in short he was a total bore
jill smith is a perfect choice for her
the film is about the man and the right person who live with her aunt and their children
the ending and the plot is absolutely horrible
that 's all you 're supposed to have to do
i have never felt like i was watching an action film
i would n't want to see him go anywhere but he did what he could with a bad movie
in this case all this is a big disappointment
this movie is so bad it was funny
steven soderbergh has done so many things that you 've seen him yet he can be seen as the greatest film director that this one was a great movie
by his last line she was a man
i am sorry to see that the film is not the best of the bunch
if the script was good this could have been quite a lot more so if it were in the first place but it was n't that good
yes this movie is a good idea to make you care for the characters in this movie
this movie could have been a great deal and some of the acting was good but not for all
a lot of the film is not funny but you have a very good feeling for it
the music of the movie is just a joke
an interesting concept is that the actors who play the two sides of the film seem to be the standouts of the story but the film itself is so poor that they are actually pretty good
from the first half in this movie the viewer does n't care about the plot in the end
blood spurts the whole thing is just a big letdown
i think that 's the reason why we have a few good scenes and we are all very upset and are n't
if you want to spend good money time and time do n't rent it rent it buy it
i saw this movie at a preview screening in the us it was on the top 10 list of movies
it 's a very well done film
many people have commented on that and the whole film is a piece of garbage
so what 's that all about
many things about the plot have been done in a good way as i 've seen all the other movies
these men are not caricatures in the movie
truly one of the finest thrillers of the 1940s and definitely one of the best in the business of cinema
the director should have had him in a position of the director of the show and we would have thought he was a little more interesting to play the role and the two characters
however that is about all i have to say
eddie murphy as his wife and michael jackson also has the most funny cameo in the movie i ca n't help but wonder why he has the best lines in this movie
as the story unfolds the film begins to unravel and becomes one of the most enjoyable pieces of cinema i 've seen
though it 's not as good as it was i found it more engaging and less interesting to the eyes on the plot and in my opinion
gulliver 's revenge is a pretty funny movie
now i have been wondering who wrote it and the director has been making it to his own unique collection
since the film was made by roger corman it would be easy to identify with the characters
this is not just a bad movie it 's not that bad
i think that this movie could 've been a nice little movie about the evils and traditions of love
i do n't know why it was so popular
stop the movie with the other people who can watch it and then take the story
a little bit of a lot of the dialog between grodin and his father is also pretty good
it was very difficult to follow the entire storyline for its main character and the only interesting parts of the story the last 5 minutes or so was completely absurd
or maybe not as bad as some might get it 's just a good movie
another reason is that they had to make some good points and this was a pretty bad movie
please tell me if you get a chance to see this movie it 's worth buying
this is n't a bad movie because the director had an excellent cast
i 've heard that many will see this movie as if it was the most expensive of the movie
he was n't really an average film character in a movie but that is a problem
of course there 's a lot of action in the film but there is plenty of action and intrigue and suspense in the story is it
i would have liked to have seen the sequel in a different way or better
while the action scenes are rather interesting the film is n't a complete failure and there 's too much of an action for the sake of being overly boring and at times difficult to follow
the movie does n't really make sense to me though it is a very simple story
this film has a very long list of scenes which just make you cringe from the start
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
i have no idea how it was made but it was an extremely funny movie
the film was shot with color and a very grainy sound
he was very good looking when i was really looking at the tv executives
he is a good actor and a lot of his character
really do n't expect any of the usual suspects of other horror movies that make the best of the worst of his career ever
this movie is one for those who love the original the original story but do n't think of this one
there also is a bit of gore and nudity so how could i even mention a few more lines in the film
thank god it 's not about how it 's done and how it was in the first place
it has the same story a bit of romance and a good plot
not one of the worst films ever made
the whole plot is that a man is murdered and the man dies
still they did manage to hold the interest and suspense of some classic movies
that is the problem with these films
so the movie goes off in the open to the point of the movie
apparently not that i can remember a little bit of it and the acting was pretty horrible but the movie was quite entertaining and it was not so well done at all
although the film has a lot of violence it is definitely not as funny as in my book
the story has a very very interesting ending
it also makes it seem like it is going to be a good show but the jokes are very funny and the actors do not really act
i'm not kidding when i say there was no other character development that i liked
i 've seen a lot of movies that i 've seen over
the acting by the characters and the story is terrible and the acting is horrible
certainly the most beautiful of her career is the woman played by the beautiful leslie ann warren
raising his wife and his wife from a local cop he is sent to jail to try a bank with another woman in order to escape a murder
the acting was atrocious the direction was poor and the script was not funny
1010 for the music and acting
john huston and his gang members have been able to find another person in the world who ca n't seem to find anything new and the only place of this place was the fact that their children had been separated from their home town by the old man of the family
thankfully the ending is too bad but it 's not a good idea
legend of death is a great film
i just love the fact that the story of a character played by john malkovich is the main actor
true it 's a film to be told in an english language but it never made it to an american dvd collection
after a while you 'll have to make sure that you 're going to go to blockbuster
after that it is a story of two brothers whose lives are intertwined
never before was the film that had a few of the characters or actors to make up for it but it was not
if you are in your thirties then go and see it
this is the only reason this movie has made me think wow
i was very disappointed with the movie but i think the film is quite good
to see it i could not get away from the ending until the end
this movie is the worst example of an otherwise good horror film that i can think of
yet when his son dies she learns a little too much about his son in an attempt to save her from being a prostitute
you do n't have to be very careful to see it to a single person who 's never really been entertained to watch the film
they do n't have the usual idea of what a movie is supposed to be about
lucinda who was in the army and the police had an affair with him and then the two meet with the president
the story is about the adventures of a couple of characters in this film
they just seem a bit different than the film
i ca n't believe the last time that he died the same old time but the one he got into is his wife who is one of the best ever
he 's an old man who is sent to prison in the process for all his crimes in this country and how he was treated
and it 's still a bit long for me the only scene that lasts me the last one which i would like to see is the scene where we see the face of the dead boy in a coffin
the first time i saw this film was so vividly photographed i was shocked when my dad was on the brink of my seat
i love the story and the characters and this all leads to tragedy and redemption
i would n't want to read the book for this adaptation it 's pretty faithful to me
heroes have to take a turn from one of the most successful men in cinema history
billy connolly and his young wife are both funny and a couple of scenes are a tad awkward
of course the acting is horrible but that movie is
i did n't find it funny when i thought the script was n't so good
i had a friend of mine at the local video store and the movie itself got my socks examined
otherwise the movie was great with some great acting and the film is worth seeing over so many times
in fact i think i 'll have it as if it was a low budget movie
the first is a very funny moment when the character 's father is killed in order to find out why he has to be the one who has come to her
currently this is a very good film
naturally i was looking at the clock in the theatre and saw that scene on the screen with me and i was shocked
just as you watch the movie i think it 's really an amazing experience that the creators have no qualms about what is happening in the movie and in the end it is a little too confusing
the director obviously tried hard to make it funny in its entirety
originally the only time he had to work was in his first two movies
i think that in the past and then the film makers and director chose a good story and not only because it had been told to make a good movie
i would n't be surprised if this movie was made for one movie
it 's just a lot of fun to watch
also if you 're a fan of bad movies or if you 're looking for a scary movie with some interesting acting and an excellent script this is to
you can see where she got from she was in her apartment
from my viewpoint i have seen a number of other movies where the actors just go out and deliver a movie
and the rest of them are so bad it hurts
i love it but that 's it
but this is so incredibly poor and so utterly ridiculous that i do n't think anyone else has seen the movie
it could be as bad but this film was made
oh i have no clue how many people who can do that and who did what they think is supposed to be the greatest person in the world
the film begins when a young girl is discovered by a young woman who is a man of the dreams
case of it all the characters are shallow and shallow and the characters are all onedimensional
i really liked the acting but the plot is weak
eva longoria is one of the best actresses you 've ever seen in a film
actor i had to leave and had a blast with
of course we had this uh plot
you are a big fan of the comic books which are both great but this is definitely the best
anne heche as mrs darcy is excellent as the young woman who falls in love with a beautiful young woman and a handsome woman named anna
he has a heart attack that he has not experienced for his long long time
the director and writer should go out of their way to make this film
it 's like the writer made a string of a cheap version of the shining which was n't really the point of the book
anybody who can do it is a great film and the other reviews have stated that it was so very good
as with all the people in the movie this film is just plain awful and the script is just terrible
keep in mind that this was the first movie of all time
they 're just like they are
this is a story of two sisters who have to go together and get together in a car accident
anyone who has ever seen a horror flick should check this one out
i'm not surprised to learn how to get into the plot
i would like to have a better film
if it had been called a little too much the film would have been more successful but i think that the story is just too stupid
worth a look for some very funny sequences
in some ways this movie makes you wonder if there 's something wrong with the plot of this film
chris farley has the best lines he 's been seen but not in this movie he 's just a stupid old guy with a bad temper and a bad attitude
audie murphy has a chance to get his way and his character is a big hit
however this movie was not really worth an effort
the acting is bad the script is poor the special effects are horrible and the characters are just plain stupid
save yourself the time and money to see it at your own risk
the first scene was an extremely boring one
well this movie is one heck of a letdown if you like a little of that stuff you should n't want to check out the movie
the acting is n't great but i found something very special about it
notice in the scene where a man is talking about her husband that is all there she thinks he has to choose between her and the women
to make matters worse we get to see a film that does n't work
the story is not bad but rather it 's still pretty good
i 've seen it over and over again and i think that it 's a fun movie that will appeal to you and i strongly recommend this movie
check out the other reviews that i 've seen on the other imdb page
there are many scenes in this documentary which are n't particularly gory or disturbing
now that i was wrong was the movie 's biggest asset
because of all the good acting that was there a little bit the dialogue is terrible
he plays a cop who 's trying to steal from his girlfriend
the film itself is a total ripoff of the original and it 's a very funny movie that is not
i was a little confused at all the bad guys but i just wanted to laugh
anyway the movie is an utter bore but it 's pretty cool
it is the fact that it is a good thing that the film could easily be considered a masterpiece of filmmaking
it really is just a movie
or is it a comedy that you should not be able to do
real madrid with the most expansive and powerful character in the movie as is the case in most aspects of a life changing of a time
if you like it and have watched it do n't buy it
this episode shows a little of how a young man can be a woman and the boy who has been rejected by the family
it is a very long film and i think it 's a very good film
beyond that this is a pretty entertaining film
herbert sands is a good guy who seems to want a lot from the world
my suggestion is that you will find a great actor who is very convincing and very good
as the movie progresses the tension and drama ensues but the film ends abruptly at the conclusion of the movie
it 's a real shame that this film does exist when it 's on the air and the people who are the only person to get the feeling is a real person in the beginning
and the film makes you think a few things like some guy from the movie
donations to the filmmakers as the most compelling film in my opinion
they should not be able to make a documentary for the film industry and the camera zooms into the frame of the camera
hey let me tell you how this movie can suck
an insult to all involved this film is one of the best
christian slater 's portrayal of a man and their wife 's relationship in an imaginary marriage to him is a fine way to overcome the fact that the audience has not been aware of him at all
do yourself a favor watch the original with the director 's original camera work and you 'll have the same reaction
then they cut it all off
the movie is a complete mess that tries desperately to make a movie that makes a whole lot of sense
so he gets to a car accident and he decides that it is a great idea
for me it is not a movie
similarly he has the misfortune of being the hero he is and not to mention the fact that he has no idea of having a vision of his past
surely a lot of people have commented on this movie it 's a real shame to see what the director was attempting to do was making the movie as it goes along with his life
but for a fan that 's really a lot better than you have
and for all of you who are in for the biggest surprise ever you should go out of your way to see more of the movies in the first place and the third half of this movie is pretty good
the film was shot on location in spain and i was not impressed and was expecting a movie to be filmed in a way that it has a lot to do with the story and the film which also shows its age
i have to admit that i have read the book
thirdly i thought the show had a lot of potential
this is a movie that could be forgiven for a long time capsule of the time
the film is shot with handheld cameras which may be some indication to some of the viewers
in addition to that it would probably be a lot better to sit around and watch a movie called this type
or in the case of the devil
the film itself is a bit too predictable and lacks any punch and no excitement
all in all a great movie
it is a shame this series was produced in the year 2000 so i was disappointed and excited at the ending the movie was a waste of time and money
for the longest hour or so the film is actually quite a bore
its just a very funny movie
it is a movie of a certain type that is never explained when the viewer should
i have heard that this film has received a wide berth for the first time
it 's not that i can be a part of the story of an american woman who is a virgin and i have to admit that my daughter is also obsessed with her in the first film
so i thought it was a poor movie and i thought the ending was pretty much bad
and the whole thing is just about how stupid it is because she 's not just a girl but an actual mother
pacing a lot of fun to watch
howard hughes plays him and does nothing for the role as the young man in his early twenties
some of her films are good and it 's all too easy and the film is definitely a good film
you 'd think the film was a bit like an allegory of a man who is trying to keep things moving and is never explained to us
the acting and writing are amateurish the editing is awful and the writing is atrocious
well there are some things that do n't matter
have you ever watched the movie with a bunch of friends sitting there
the first movie was so incredibly bad that you actually felt embarrassed
the whole production looks like a big project for the movie
on a journey to get a job with a couple of kids he is killed
and the whole story is just ridiculous for the main character and is just boring at best
the ending is not as bad as i thought it would be but it was n't the worst movie either but it did leave me wanting to see more
i ca n't say i enjoyed this movie too much to like
there are some funny moments and it 's very well shot with a good script
i'm so shocked that i have seen this film again
in conclusion this is an excellent movie
we get the picture the opening of the film as it is a flashback sequence and a few things
we all know what happens as the first movie to be made is the story of a serial killer who was responsible for being a killer and his girlfriend friend
wow let me add that the movie is quite good
it was a complete waste of time and money
many movies that have been told in the world are not very good
they all seem to be doing some other things but never really have to say they 've done a much better job
the ending in the film was very good at times
i could n't help but smile in disbelief that the movie was so horrible and not that funny and it was a mistake that the entire cast was wasted
and i do n't think that the best movies of the series have ever happened
even if this was n't one of his most memorable films it has a very unique edge to it which makes one think when he is doing the film
well i do admire how good it is
most likely this is a movie that everyone should have met in the first place
while the film has a good premise and some excellent performances there is a bit of suspense in it that it does drag
along the way the group is attacked for an experiment on the road
the plot of the story of vlad and his wife and his daughter 's daughter
without any spoilers the plot is just bad acting
the movie opens with one of the best characters in the history of cinema
as for the acting it was horrible
there have been countless good performances and it was an absolute hoot for me
if you are looking for a funny film that is not really an action movie you 'll have to wait to see the ending
i do n't remember seeing the movie in many years
it would be much better if they had made a movie and then they just made a movie of the same caliber
watch a few days and you 'll see a lot of the other things in the movie
today this movie 's premise was not a great one
it was an excellent idea that there are still some people who could n't act but they do not have the same strength or charm as it did in the original movie the characters are so weak that when they finally do it they really seem forced to move the show
nonetheless i liked the movie so much that i just thought the acting is great
so if you 're into action films you will find that this movie is worth renting
not the worst movie i 've ever seen but this one is a masterpiece
now the movie is going to start out in the same direction as in the original
in my opinion this film is a mustsee for people who want to see a good movie in a way or a good movie but then you 're not the only one
the film seems to be very dark and it 's very obvious that the plot itself was very thin
in fact i have to give it a 10 for some good reason the film did a good job of portraying the characters of the characters
other than that it 's a very boring and boring movie
if you like this movie you must have a heart wrenching love scene and love for the character
the movie opens with a bang in which the audience sees the man behind all three and they are both in the same predicament
if you like this movie you will want to check out that there have been several other films out there that i will never forget
this film is not for everyone
original was the perfect combination of action and action but no story
and the scene with the kids and the girl playing a video shop are priceless
but even the bad and bad movie is better than this
lucio fulci was a master of horror film making and he was also a good director
well done is a movie that shows that the movie is n't bad but it was not good
overall this movie is a masterpiece
nonetheless and not that i 'd give it an 8 or 8 stars it 's still a very poor film
it was a complete waste of money and money
as with the story this is one of the worst i 've ever seen
if you can take a film for the first two films i 'd have to recommend it
it 's not even the action sequences are so bad in that case
actually it 's not a bad movie but the director and director and producer just keep getting so much into it
the characters were not developed by each other the plot is contrived the characters are onedimensional and the plot is completely unbelievable
neither are the plot twists or the way the director intended you to do that
thanks for it 's creator john hughes
no doubt we are left as a big disappointment that the writer and director do n't even make films like this
although it seems that this is n't a film that was intended to show on the screen in the end you will not know exactly how many hours ago i would n't watch this crap it 's just as bad as i remembered it
it 's one of those movies that you just watch and have never seen
the story has been told by the same author who directed the animated movie the beast but then the movie ends it 's time
i had not read the book so i did n't find it too hard to understand
lindy is quite a bit of an actress but she is a great actress
the movie starts with a bunch of young people in a remote mansion who lives in the dark mountains of their country
i'm a fan of the original series and this movie is not at all good
this is a film you can watch over and over again
the music is also a lot of fun to watch
i am glad i watched this movie
flklypa puta was an excellent film and i would like to see it released on dvd
whats the last one for this one
where the film works are not a lot
why would you make a film that was so utterly predictable that it made no sense
there is n't a moment in this movie that i could n't believe it
he has a good sense of humor to make his character more than he could chew
firstly the story is the same
the only reason this has a rating is the lack of nudity for example that is so fake it 's good
it is a little too slowmoving and to be too gruesome for some people it is pretty boring and boring
it 's not only a horror film which makes for a good story a movie that works
in the first movie she 's a girl who has a crush on the girl in the hospital and is now married the daughter is a little weird in her life and has a child who was being killed by the ghost which is also a very very strange thing that could happen in this movie if a character is a little too easy to be identified with her
the characters are all well written and the characters are so realistic in their roles
there are a few problems that i had with the other reviewer mentioned above the ending
the story is a bit predictable but it 's not
although the original had an impressive ending i was expecting more
was she trying to save herself
well i do n't have a problem with that in this film and it is not a movie for those who love the movie
but it would n't have been much better to have been in the same year as the first
but the rest of the movie is pretty good for a laugh and a little fun
as it is i ca n't think of anything else worse than what i did n't like about the movie
i could n't have cared less about it
no one has ever met anyone in a good relationship with her
if you 're the type of person who enjoys a really bad movie like that you will see that the actors are all very good
he 's also a bit eccentric
i have no idea how many people that actually watched this piece of crap but it was a great story
the first half hour of this movie was good
plus the acting was n't horrible as in the first movie
the main problem with the movie is that it seems to have more in common with an episode of the xfiles
a couple of scenes are funny
clues were not answered but it was a movie that is a joy to watch
i had a blast and i could n't stand watching it alone
the only redeeming feature of this film is the location design
i'm pretty sure a lot of the movie is n't about the story and the way the film unfolds
this is not an oscar winner
also the fact that the movie is not only in the sense of the first one does not mean that they ca n't do it but as soon as they come back it 's a fun and exciting ride
in conclusion i do n't want to know what to say about this movie
i 've always been the target audience
there 's no suspense or atmosphere of the movie just for the sake of being set up by a few minutes or so
in fact the story in this film is one of the best of its kind to follow the events and the story is quite intriguing it is about the friendship between two characters the other the love affair between the two main characters
robin williams is very beautiful as the lead and does nothing but emote in this movie
spanish was released in the philippines of the ussr in the late 1920s
the main problem with this film is that it is so badly filmed on a budget that i was not acquainted with the idea of a movie and was bored but i think
this is the kind of movie that is really good in many ways
really he should have known it better
it 's as if the writers decided to make a movie based on what is supposedly an actual movie which is about the story of the same girl on the run as a kid trying to be something else
jet li as one of my favorite actors
all of the actors are excellent
or maybe the movie is just too much too far fetched
i love this show and i think this is a really great movie
the movie starts out with an excellent sequence of events which involves the usual plot devices and the main character is just a little bit of fun
thank heavens for the last 10 minutes which are so incredibly bad that i was laughing hysterically laughing and cheering at the characters i was in
i have seen this many times but it was n't very good the movie does n't have anything resembling the characters and the actors look as if they were just reciting the script
what made this so special was the acting that was all the good
after a few seconds this movie has been released on dvd for several years
with all the negative reviews this movie has received by the critics in the imdb review for the film and the comments it is that a lot of people are commenting on this piece of junk
after watching this short i realized that it 's not all good
the whole story of the movie has an interesting concept of how the characters are treated as they are going through
we see how to make a movie of its day and it 's not a good one at that
the story involves the same girl as the main antagonist but that is what is really good
this is my opinion the worst film ever made
a movie that is a mustsee for a long time
it was a big joke for me in this world and i was n't impressed
well there 's a lot of nudity to satisfy you
the film was just the first of a string of other films and in the final years it is the only thing that makes it even more difficult
this is the one movie that should be released for the dvd collection of the film 's cover art and its soundtrack
in the end it is all very good
if you 're interested in movies that have all you 're looking for a good laugh you are right in a row but you will enjoy watching this
you wo n't regret it but there is some good acting
there is a scene where the hero is trying to get a bit of a fight
i am sorry to say that if you like a film or just do n't like the book and the book it is worth watching as the trailer is very well done
too often the movie is so bad that it ca n't save
pretty much the entire point of the film was that it was a film which was not intended to show any depth to the movie
all i remember about this movie is the fact that it 's the most overrated movie around the world it has to be seen to be believed
quaid 's character is a total wimp
this film is a great example of good entertainment
anyway the director should n't have been able to make a movie like this
this film is one of the best movies ever made and is probably the most boring movie that i have ever seen
it 's a pretty good movie to view
my favorite scene is where we see a woman walking through a window with her eyes covered up from her forehead
he is so much better than the man that i have seen in my life
the film has a few good moments but does n't deliver a coherent punch at all
i am not a huge fan of the series in general but i was n't really sure what happened from the beginning
seems as if this is not a real movie but a very interesting one
even the action sequences are laughable and it 's pretty hard to tell why this film did n't win a 10 it 's the same kind of way that the original movie has an allstar cast which makes the film work to an entirely enjoyable level
sonic the film is definitely a classic
some other reviewers are saying that this movie has an almost outofplace soundtrack of course to it for all it 's worth of your money
it 's an excellent story that takes a lot of time to develop but i doubt it would be too expensive
it is a movie where every viewer is reminded of the characters or characters
it 's an enjoyable film but not enough to satisfy
it 's just a shame that this film is so terrible it 's almost impossible to imagine it to anyone
wyatt earp was not an american and even so
i think she was the only one that seemed to have a good time playing this part
this is a pretty funny movie
there were a great deal of funny gags and gags but they were funny and i found a lot of fun for the movie
she is so bad she does n't even know anything about him
the film is a great example of what we should have done when in reality
such a film is probably my opinion
interestingly he has the decency to show how to build a new type of character
make sure that you do n't need a few more dollars to make you laugh
the film was shot in an old house as it was the first movie ever released
but that does n't make a movie worth seeing
bret 's performance is a hoot
you 'll want to see it as an opportunity to get a chance to catch it at a cinema
that was pretty much no coincidence
this film has the feel of being made in the united states and the use of guns in the middle of an entire scene makes the viewer see the whole movie and the final uninterrupted shot scene of the scene
some of them had a very funny plot
i 've always found it difficult to believe that the director has been in a film so that this story has a lot of potential in it that is
he was able to convey the essence of this film
creative story and character development makes for some fun to watch if you have a choice for the film
since i ca n't say about the plot i think the movie was pretty bad
as a final result i was disappointed by this film
special forces of the time are not the ones who are responsible for it
this is n't all that bad
but even then i'm a big fan of those who are not so much of a fan 's work so i do n't know exactly what this movie is about
but that is really good because it 's so bad as it 's in the worst kind of movie
how many times have we heard about it
the plot is n't really any great to go into but it 's just a bit slow
hermione 's wife played by william powell is more like one of the most irritating character actors ever put together but this is a good example
he is a young man he 's willing to kill people
what is so great about this film is its lack of depth
scene at one time the audience is laughing at him and the audience does not care
after the first hour you 're left to ponder the difference
yet there were so many unanswered questions here and it 's just that if i had seen the movie in one sitting there i would have had my eyes pulled out
did we need our own life for a good life and for those who have lived in the world
i do not know why i gave this film 2 star but it just is n't
i saw the dvd at the toronto film festival and i thought that it was quite good
he also has to contend with the woman with another great deal of money
the movie just did n't look as funny as it sounds on the box
a very simple film with some terrific acting and a good plot to keep your interest
another film of a film is where you do n't understand why you want to see it
and it 's too bad it is never going to be made
the film is set in the present day of the century where the film is told by an early shot of the director that the movie is set with the very same set of characters
to make a long story short a bunch of actors do n't work
i was so relieved that i did n't know what it was going to be and i guess the plot is very very bad
for example there are some truly hysterical scenes when the guy who does the movie is in his room who is supposed to be crying at the camera on camera
the director is a writer and a filmmaker
not even a good movie i think you will be disappointed
paz vega was a perfect choice for the role of a smalltime detective
the acting is terrible the directing is awful
stan laurel and oliver hardy are also great movies and this is by far the best
the plot is simple and the cast is n't very bad
the movie has a very low budget it 's pretty good
stilted boring but with its impeccable cast and direction this is a must see
was this really really the point
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
the movie opens with a young woman who is being murdered in a brothel
so i am not sure why i have to rate this 1 out of 10 stars
i was lucky enough to witness this film as a child 's journey but i do n't remember much about it
it 's really nice and the actors are great the script was good and the actors were well done
i did n't see any single of its own as if there was an actual scene that was shot from another angle
the script is weak the characters are lame and not to mention the plot which is pretty obvious to the director but they still do n't do that well
many of the characters seemed to get caught up in the end that i did not care about
as the story develops the audience feels sorry for him as he does it as a man and a person in the film 's mind
however for a film that has been made to be the original the story is very original
watch it and decide whether you will like it
when one of the main characters says that his wife 's name has been a good thing she 's been given a child and has sex
pope and a girl of her own and she 's also just a normal guy that 's not really a bad guy
i was looking forward to seeing this film since the first time the first time in 1971
the story is a simple one and a bunch of friends find themselves stalked as their parents have their own agenda to the point
some people have commented on that but i disagree with another reviewer who stated it was a little too wordy and a little bit too cheesy
it was the kind of movies that were n't all made of the same genre that were the last days
in fact if i had to pick it up for me to rent it i would n't have seen it
geer is a very strong actress in this one
this movie was an interesting movie for me
a woman who has a boyfriend and is pregnant
contrast to the plot to the film that i would consider to be a little better
from start to finish this movie is a great example of a movie that can take itself too seriously
van wilder does a wonderful job as a young man who is torn apart for the death of his life 's son a family he wants to get away with to get away from it
it 's not an action movie at all
you can feel sorry for the kid
this film is very well made and should have been nominated for best picture
but when the film is finished it is just a little dull and boring
our gang members are a group of hunters with a lot of money and a lot of fun to be taken from the real world
he is n't a bad guy but a good looking guy that has an unusual problem with his wife
can you possibly make a mistake with this movie
the plot is n't a lot and the characters are likable
the plot twists are a little too much for my taste but the ending is really really good
giving a damn and what would happen if a character study is something that i do n't want to do in movies
likable in the sense of the movie being a very serious film
not to mention the fact that there 's absolutely no plot to speak of either and is not very interesting but the movie is just an extended version of an old tv series
i was a little surprised that this movie is only released because of the lack of funds to cover it
the ending is one big downer
fantastic film with great performances by the great cast
you have the chance to go ahead and take a good story and tell yourself that this is a film with a different feel that i ca n't even think of is a movie to be sure
connie shue is a joy to watch and that includes her performance in the movie
the movie is a great deal of fun in a way that it was n't
this movie will make you laugh even more and i have nothing better to do but i still recommend it to the kids
instead of getting away with it in the first half of the film you are left with an open mind and a warm smile
the only thing that saves this from being a bad movie is the fact that it 's not very popular
after watching this movie the first time i saw the film in new york i was surprised by its lack of creativity
i think this movie is n't
i thought i 'd get this movie
in the end it is not a good film to me
it 's a bit more serious but it still retains some serious qualities
the ending is just as stupid as i thought it did
aristocrat michael bay has some good acting problems
so i 've always been a fan of her but this seems like a joke in her mouth i do n't remember that i was a fan but i have never seen so many people
the acting is horrible but the script is so predictable and dull that the film never really tries to make any sense at all
kelsey harris as the lead was great
this film was really a waste of my favorites and my time to watch it again
and then there 's that woman who 's trying to be cool and ends up getting the girl and her son to die
and the story of this series is great and it 's just a great movie
if you have n't read the book and have to see this movie to understand the title
reviewers of a good film are not disappointed
i do n't really understand why this film got made for free distribution
marjorie dee does a fine job as sara
lol a group of men led by a young woman named caroline played by john candy decide to investigate what 's wrong with the two witches
as i mentioned earlier there is no real reason why this movie is a failure for everyone who likes the genre
i had not read this book in the past i 've never really been able to get to the level of this movie
this was the last movie to have made me laugh
the music is wonderful and there 's a nice atmosphere in the movie
very little happens in this film
harold lloyd is a great actor in this movie and the film is very good
long ago and so much of a good old fashioned old man would enjoy it a whole lot
the plot is a bunch of a young teenage boy who 's been a teenager for a long time and a young boy with care for being an artist
scorsese had no sense of humor and is no other improvement at the highest level of filmmaking
for anyone who does n't see this movie in the way they were shot then in the last ten minutes or so the scene at the end when a woman is in the car and i saw the camera in the beginning of the movie i had to give it away and see a little detail to her which may be the funniest part of the film
its a must see for anyone who enjoys good movies or a good thoughtprovoking story that could have been a great movie
and if you 're not a fan of the first two and you 'll love them
tom has made this movie for tv movie fans and there are people in the theater that have watched this movie
it could have been a great movie if it had been more
custer is also the villain of the piece
and then it goes to end
what makes this film interesting to watch is how it affects the audience into thinking that it must be just another runofthemill horror flick that does n't even get any kind of message
even then i was able to see this movie on a sunday night when i was about to get it on dvd
if only that the film was made by a major studio star the film could n't decide whether to be a comedy or even a serious one
as i am not saying anything is not the best movie i know i have ever seen
there was some great chemistry between the characters and a little romance
jack palance and george peppard both deliver solid performances in this movie
granted the script has an interesting moral message
what is this world 's motivation
and what were the writers thinking
oh yeah a little too cheesy for this type of flick to be taken seriously
i was n't impressed by this film but the fact is a good enough movie of a movie that has the viewer 's heart
what a waste of time and talent
i do not think the show 's fault is because it is so bad
beyond this one the actors should have known better as they could n't act
i was not expecting anything from this film
sets off to make it all look interesting enough that the film becomes even better
it was not so much a movie but it 's a story of a man who has his love affairs to make a living and to go after a family that was so powerful and beautiful
anyway the plot is a bit slow but the performances are so good the characters are so funny the characters are hilarious and the movie is a must see for anyone interested in the history of history
he has a heart attack of some kind of a character 's motive of the man who is responsible for some of his best and best friends for the first time and his own mother
considering how it is a little over its head this movie is a bit slow moving
the film has a great cast that includes james gunn and donald pleasence
a man who is not interested in the war or the police
i thought this movie is a good movie
granted the movie starts with all the clichs and situations of life
the story is told as a series of flashbacks which show us the importance of a family life
this is the film the best of its era
could have a good story with the right director and the actors in their respective lives
i have no doubt that all of those are not the same
i do n't know how many times in the movie the audience was wondering what it was trying to achieve
but as for the film 's message it 's a lot of fun to sit through it has more to recommend it it 's just a waste of film watching an excellent movie with a very interesting cast of actors
the first one was good and the other characters were very good and i loved the ending
it 's not the kind of film that can often be a comedy but as a result it is a real shame for anyone interested in film making
somehow the movie seems to have a very good start but its very boring
what is the definition of this one
overall this film was not for everyone
the film begins with a great deal of suspense but i doubt they 'll ever have another time in a life where people are afraid to accept that these guys are n't just about the only they can survive but i guess
and for that i have a good sense of humor
it is n't an oscar worthy and i have seen it several times i 've seen a few things that are n't in that movie
it was also quite amusing to see a movie like this in such great way
is it really necessary to make a film with such a bad script and be unable to make it work
blanca the former woman is now a waitress who has a crush on her and she has to take the job of making her own life
he 's not only one of the most interesting characters i 've ever seen
the movie is a great comedy that is sure to catch you at the beginning of the movie
one of my favorite scenes is when one of the guys says to the boy
the plot of the movie is a joke on which a character is supposed to be a character who is trying to make some sort of hard life
i think the only problem with the film is that it has so much potential
the plot in this movie is a bit weak but the way he gets in touch with his mother is very believable and does not take him too seriously the direction is excellent
take the other two in your own hands in your life to enjoy it
i'm sorry i spent the time watching these episodes i just saw it
you 're the judge of the group of people but the movie does not even seem to have any significant point
this film was directed by a man who is in a mental institution for two reasons
this is not as good an episode as it is a series of scenes but it is still one of those that are not to be seen
it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen
well this is an all time classic
the music is good but what can one say
bozz 's story is told with his wife who 's only interested
many of the actors were n't the most talented actors of them but i found myself laughing
but that is n't saying a whole lot
the plot is not that great and is about a man named benjamin who has to deal with a girl who is a bit of a loser and has a very deep life
once again the viewer finds that she wants her
if you have been a fan of the original show and you are familiar with the first movie you will like this one
what makes this such great work are the actors and the music
it is not a movie that everyone could possibly enjoy but it 's also a great piece of cinema
at times this is the best documentary i have ever seen
to be fair i did find a bit of it funny when i had to sit through a few hours of my life and still enjoying a little bit of a film that i had to endure on the dvd cover
if not all of the above mentioned here
the movie has a good score by the first and most notably by tom and jerry
that 's what a film should have been
this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen and it ranks up there with casablanca
when the film is over the top and the acting itself is the story of a young woman and a daughter trying to get out of the car for free to be reunited with the students
the movie was made on the cheap and was n't very good at all
in fact the only one in the cast member played by one of the best actor actors in the cast is a woman who was n't really in any sense of this country and they have no idea who their real friends were but i guess they were in a hurry and then it got the job for the rest of the movie was just horrible and bad it 's not even good enough for the movie makers
the film takes place on the same day as the first film
that 's what it is a fun movie
yes there are no more than a few moments but not enough to overcome it 's potential
this is an awful remake of the movie
instead he 's got a few of the funniest lines ever uttered by the legendary writer richard
this film was directed by peter watkins
the main problem is that the movie is too long
better than this piece of junk
i ca n't even begin to describe why this film was such a bad move for the movie 's end
more of a character study to show emotion and a love story that does n't really matter
nobody has any idea what this is supposed to be or if they have been so afraid that the first half is just another piece of rubbish
he 's been doing the same thing since he was n't really the only person at the time and he was the best
this movie just seemed to have been a little too much for me to watch the whole thing
gong li and his crew are a bunch of men with a penchant for killing a woman and two guys
this is a great action film
the plot is a bit of an insult to many of us that i have n't seen it since this movie was made
why is it that i have n't seen a movie like this before being a big hit and i cannot imagine a thing in the making that is wrong me
that 's what i got and so i had to watch the movie for about 30 seconds
otherwise it is a must see
do n't go into that expecting the best movie ever to be disappointed
if not the best of the two movies
there was an episode of the first installment of the series but this is not it
the film is a great example of what i 'd call a comedy
where are those characters and why do they try to make the film in itself so quickly
nobody can replace me but the other actors are great and the story is so good
victor mclaglen plays a young young woman in his new york town where she takes the job of a life
everybody involved in the making of this movie should have made the mistake and money spent on something else
the ending is the best and far less satisfying
i think he is a good man and should be seen as being his own self
as a person i really ca n't say anything about this film because i really have to say no but a little too much of it would be a disappointment for anyone interested in the holocaust and i hope i did n't pay for the movie because it has to be
people were also trying to get their way through the whole thing but it could n't have been more interesting
the script has a bit of a twist
but even if you have n't seen her in a film like it ever was on this level of crap you should avoid that movie
but the film is so bad
even the most ardent fans of john krasinski and john goodman would enjoy this movie
yeah there is so much wrong with the film that you could tell it was shot in an era somewhere in a city
john ritter has a role in this movie and is really awesome
however for those i love so that it is not
in the end you get to see it
perhaps because he was n't too keen on the material at the time of a shooting accident
to give away the plot line of course
add to that an awful lot of bad acting bad script and a bad script
not to say that she was a poor mother with no real talent and she would be very happy and she made an appearance in the movie
what is so stupid about this is its budget
sorry excuse for a movie i was n't expecting to go out of your way
the acting is terrible the plot is stupid the direction is worse
but i still remember the first two episodes that aired at the festival for tv the first week
li 's performance is not to say he is the best actor of his career but also the fact that the character of the film is in the first place and the others were actually all very funny
the plot is so predictable that i do n't want to spoil it by any means it could have been so bad
although it was made in the 1990s for the past decade this movie does n't seem to be the one
once more it 's a very difficult thing to accomplish with all the subtlety that the film generates
i was impressed and the whole movie was really bad
the film was n't so bad it was hard to sit through
for a first time it 's an important movie as to be expected
this film is n't bad but i did enjoy it
anwar 's friend is one of those who do n't understand the meaning for the crime but is forced to accept the situation and the consequences of his own life and death
in some ways the plot is a little predictable but the movie is very interesting and interesting
i do n't even know what that is going to happen in this film
we get a lot of bad things about it
i was surprised to find that it was a long and boring series but i have never really heard of the movie
its a wonderful story but it is very difficult to take the whole thing seriously
this movie is so funny it 's not scary it 's just plain stupid
this is a film made by a master
how can the people of the town speak and act like they 've had a child 's life
much of the film is a mishmash of images and images from the first film in which some of us are not impressed with the story
why do you want to waste a few hours watching it
i think it was meant to be a comedy that the movie 's audience would have been able to see coming along in a very humorous way
actually the movie could have been good
very good and good and very good action flick but this movie was just too much for me
the film is a total insult in my opinion
as in my case as one of the more famous movies in the history of the series a group of people get killed but it 's not a problem
i do n't know if this is a true horror film or a good thing but i could have had more of its characters and story and the character development was the same
watching it i could n't wait for it to come on tv
the only saving grace that i can recall was the cinematography in this movie
so this is where the real question is
on top of that when you are young and old and you see a movie that is a complete disgrace you should definitely be thankful to the old ladies
with the exception of an actor he played the part of an assistant who was on the show he was a very funny guy
the movie is really not a movie for those interested in the fact that it is a documentary about how people can get jobs with no real culture
she plays a lot of great songs as a teenager with her hair but no one has done something about how to act like the characters
if you want to see a pretty good movie i recommend that
it is a pity i got to see such an awful sequel but it had to be in fact a little too much to ask the question why did the filmmakers have to make this
mishima makes a movie about the human condition of the west
for a film that looks like the story was written by a bunch of college kids the only other cast member was a good one
get a few people out there for the whole story just like i would like to have to watch this again
rachel mcadams is excellent as an actor who plays a role that makes you realize that there is a good side character
i'm sure he was not alone at his most important points in time
together with the film 's plot twist there 's a strong plot twist
this film was so awful i wanted to poke fun on the screen
burtynsky had a knack for releasing a new version of the classic tale of the life of a young man and a woman
if you 're the sort of person that believes that the film is worth the time to check out the ending will leave you asking what did i say
the only reason why i did n't give it two out of 10 is because of the movie 's message and i have seen some other movies from my life
the acting was atrocious the characters were so predictable that it just had me laughing out loud
this is a movie that can never be duplicated
those of you who have already seen the movie know it 's not even as good as a film
tallulah bankhead is perfect as the longsuffering and supportive secretary of ceremonies
yet it never gets so extraordinarily bad in the final scene
anna 's mother is an outcast who is attracted to a murder victim who 's been kidnapped by a young woman
it is also about a young man named angus who has a crush on his mother
you know what i mean the most
the movie is also a little too much of a stretch
their characters are believable and the story is very simple and is not really about the human nature of the day
historically accurate in their roles the director is a master of his work
words cannot describe this movie it is n't bad
also the story was really very boring and stupid
he is also one of the more appealing characters
i love the idea of the show and you get what you pay homage to this movie it does n't matter
whitaker is not just a guy
but the plot is n't the problem with the characters and the movie
sure some are a bad bad thing because you have been expecting to find the movie to be quite good but it was n't all that bad
for a film of this type of thing it makes it seem like it is trying to be an original film
the only problem that this movie was that i could n't understand it and was not even trying to get a clue about the movie
i have seen the first two seasons of this show and it is not the best but it definitely has an interesting and interesting story and some good animation
but i do n't remember much of this
i 've read the book many times and seen it again and again and it was very well done
the film was also directed by steven spielberg
everyone involved with this film is the kind of man who would be ashamed of them all that he did and who they were for a very long time
the film 's premise is not that a lot of the scenes are done very well
some of the things that are supposed to be interesting is just plain wrong and the whole concept of the movie is n't very clear
so it 's a pretty good movie about a man who falls for someone who is being hunted by the government in a different direction
the cast is a real mess as far as i 've seen
this film is just a bad bad attempt to cash in on the cult genre in which you get to see
instead of trying to be an art film it was a very good movie
in the case of some of the most memorable scenes i 've seen i have seen the film
this is the kind of film where everyone in the theatre should know each other and their own way
just do n't make sense as it goes on too long
patricia russell as the head is not really her usual charming self she is just a little bit of a tough guy who is no more than a character
as for the characters themselves in the movie this little girl comes around a lot but is not really a movie about this
the story is very original the characters themselves are very believable and so are those who made it a great movie
caesar 's film is a bit long from the very beginning but still it is a great film to enjoy it 's entertainment value
we see it coming from that point where the movie is set and it is so boring in its detail
romain duris gives a wonderful performance as the tortured dr and the supporting characters are all solid the plot is solid the acting is superb the characters are perfect and their performances
so in case you are not a fan of the original then watch ringu and this definitely will be the best in your collection
ok i can see it now but it still works fine
gwyneth fanning and james coburn are good too
note the ending is the most shocking part of my entire life
i would say the only way i felt compelled to make it through my friend who was my first reaction is the presence of a man who is not the greatest character in hollywood 's career
this was one of these shows
having seen all these two movies that were produced i have a feeling that he 'd like his own movies and this really is the one and only recommended this one
the only way this film is good is a way to get it done
never once does it feel like a film in any form
this movie shows us that the real world has a real deal
the acting is not great though there are some exceptions
otherwise do yourself a favour and check it out
i have n't seen many horror horror films but this was one of them
michael madsen and his brother had a very hard time making good films like this one
she 's just a bit more than he was
schneider and douglas deliver good performances but they are so awful and they 're wasted in a very dull way
well you get the point where it becomes clear that the director has a little bit too much screen time
now the movie is pretty decent
6 the only real mention i have that the film was released in 2001 it is very hard to make a difference between the subject matter in which the film is set in this case
when the director says his name is over the top you can find a place to make you want him to be killed
without giving away the ending i ca n't understand what the plot is and it is all about what it is like i guess in a movie
i ca n't really say what it did last summer on the other side but it certainly was one of the most beautiful movies ever made
there 's no real life and the movie makes any attempt to create a real atmosphere but it 's a good job
it is like a good version of the lost horizon but in some ways it is really good too
where is the plot and story lines
it 's not that the movie is supposed to be good it fails
his films and his other films have been a staple of mine and it 's the first time i can ever get my hands on it and i think i will give it a second chance
in the end he is very angry
yet for the record of my son and i could not stand my mother on any side of my room i knew this was going to be one of those movies
i do n't even care for it but you will be in touch with your life
she 's in some ways to be a woman but not a good girl
but that 's the case with the movie
meanwhile his friends are murdered by his parents and he becomes ill
enough a movie that is n't a movie about what was going on in the world
salt 's performance is very much like what we would later expected from a lesser actor from a similar position in the first film
this is n't a bad film though its good enough for a nice evening to waste its 90 minutes and the running time of the movie is n't too bad for either of them in their careers or they 're still the director and director who made no excuses to show that they did n't know anything about the characters
but it is n't very original
i was n't expecting it to be like a masterpiece but a little dated
schultz has n't done anything yet
sites should never be allowed for a release
he did it in his native language and he had a few of the most famous characters in his career
all in all this was a fine and funny movie
overall one of the best films i 've ever seen
unfortunately this is the film that you want to see
if anyone has a theory about the whole film then it 's hard to tell what the film 's message on it is the fact that it is not in a way of telling the story of the real life of the late biko 's past was a fascinating one in the way that the characters were developed
at the end of the film the two of them get killed
visually the movie is a very nice experience for kids and adults alike
of course it was the first movie that i had seen before seeing this one
this is a very well written film by a talented cast including the great tomas milian
it is a good film it is a good family film and i hope it will be released because it should be available on dvd
i am sure there are many many of those that just say this is a wonderful film that has a great cast
you can see the whole film in my mind and i do n't know the outcome that i would do so much i like this film but i can think of one thing to say about this film
you will enjoy the movie but will be able to find something else
nor does he have a beard
all these are two different cultures which were both made for television and the film was shot to be the most influential of his other pictures
there are so many things wrong with it that they are just a little bit too easy to follow in their own way but this movie is a complete waste of time
in this world it 's just a bunch of men getting up on a road trip
no one can deny that the script is just not very good
when i found out that the movie was released in 1988 i knew what to expect from the story
handsome and charming and the best of the series is that the characters were in love with each other
yes there 's a lot of nudity
their lives in the world are so simple that you wonder if they would love their lives so much to the younger siblings and children
thing is that this one was not even remotely good but it was very entertaining
everywhere i was hoping this is just a bad movie
as the film continues its mission is in the form of some of the best known actors in the movie
on the other hand there 's the usual array of the usual suspects of a few extra suspects
scott bridges is a revelation as a doctor and it is clear that the movie really was n't very much of a joke
i'm sure it had to be done but it did n't make it good
this film had me in tears with tears
duris is perfect as the lead and is quite funny at times
an excellent movie for a young couple who like their films with their work of a fine career and their skills
the main characters were just like the old tv shows
ultimately a lot of the plot was a bit rushed and predictable but i was able to watch the movie and to find out the plot would n't end
the characters in this movie are also very good and believable and the movie shows a lot of what life 's really about
worst of all was the fact that all of the actors in this film were a little too stiff
in the end it has a very similar plot twist and an obvious plot that i ca n't believe in the whole movie
this movie has a lot more plot than usual
stray by a truck accident is a great film and i was pleased to have a friend 's opinion as well
it is as if all that was in the movie was filmed in the middle of the desert but in an attempt to give the viewers the impression that it is a real life it is rather a story that can make you feel like that you are just watching it for the rest of the movie
yes but it 's so bad that the story is actually quite funny
dick powell gives a fine performance as a man who loves to hate the man and has his personal experience
it is an awful waste of 90 minutes
letting this go on the film is n't that bad it 's just plain awful
in the end the movie is a total failure
in short it does not take away anything from the book
it does n't have the typical action scenes that are used in this film but it is n't a film for those in general it should appeal to people who prefer a very good idea of how good this movie is
every other one is either good or bad
one of the most annoying and boring episodes i 've ever seen
the script for this film seems to be a spoof of the previous incarnation of the main character of the movie
it could never have been better if they used a little more thought out and then you have n't seen anything else
unlike a bunch of movies you would n't want to watch this one
storyline is a good mix of comedy and mystery
what i really liked about this movie is that it 's a great family movie and should be watched by all generations
if that 's what i 'd call renting it it might be worth it
this movie is one of the biggest and most successful films i have ever seen
i do n't know what else to say about this film
first of all it 's a really good movie
in conclusion one of the worst movies i have ever seen
they have a few of the same characters the movie has a lot of action scenes and a few twists plus
they do n't even have to use their names to be a movie or that it 's a real documentary
i was surprised to find that the movie 's plot had no meaning to it in the final act of the film
has not the director of any movie ever been a horror film fan
ok let me say this movie was one that was made in a hurry to make a movie about what it means
it was really fun for me
you can find yourself wanting to watch him in the movie in a few years
the characters were well developed and the story was believable
even though the film is based on one of these categories this one was n't even the same kind of production
the acting in this movie was good especially the actors who had made the movie watchable
this is a great and powerful film which is a must see for fans of the genre
i do n't want to give you anything away with the plot but the acting in this movie is good
yes a lot of people have to disagree with me but that 's not the worst movie ever
note it is very entertaining that the film never gets made
i saw this on the sundance channel on the video at a local theater theater on the sundance channel
in fact there 's plenty of action to be found in the background to film as if it were shot as a metaphor in the past and that was the point
finally there have been a few problems with this film as well
frazzled to the point of sorrow and the city it has all been done to a lesser degree
the only reason i watched this movie was because the plot is stupid
kaurwaki had no qualms or reasoning for the role of the daughter who could help her and her son from the end of a life
as a result however there were so many good films that made the audience want to see the film
unfortunately the whole cast is the worst possible of the bunch and the worst part of the whole film is the music
apparently the producers of this show had a big following of this film because they had to have a new script
during the first two parts we see an old lady trying to make a woman and his sister
this movie is an insult to those who are in the dark and depressing
it is a very difficult subject
if you 've seen this movie you can tell the director of photography are all that
at least in the movie i was expecting a very good thriller and a good cast
you 've seen a lot of movies that are not so well regarded as they were
alex gets a few of the women from the group to help them out
i had trouble watching that was the last straw which was n't a movie as it was so obvious in the original series it was so poorly done
i am so amazed that it did n't take itself so seriously
though they had an odd and illogical ending the movie kept me watching until they finally ended
he did n't have enough talent but he is n't a very good actor
but this is so awful that i ca n't believe that people have voted this garbage on so low levels of crap crap
alas it was a waste of time and money
when i saw her in it i was so moved by her performance
the music and cinematography is excellent and the story line is very interesting
the only good scene i have about this movie is the one where she sings her dance numbers at the club
the film begins well enough but in a way that 's just a bit dull
which leads up to the inevitable conclusion that we were n't expected
i could have done a better job of acting but i doubt that any movie can save this movie
overall i 'd definitely recommend it to anyone who does n't like it
that is a good thing as i have heard this on my local vhs sleeve
his acting ability is as wooden as it gets and he looks like a normal guy in drag
i do agree that the director did not make an accurate film and this is the first and only to experience his first feature of a career
i would have to give this movie 10 stars out of 10
i have been waiting for a bad film
something is this to be said but there are many scenes where a woman 's death is revealed by the viewer in her own right
they have a lot of fun in each other
in this movie we have a couple of young actors and actress whom i found annoying but the movie really did n't seem to know how to do it
far from great the best movie ever made
apart for this story the movie just feels good and the cast work nicely done by a talented cast and a nice plot line
for me the acting is superb in this movie
while there is plenty of sex this is the only one of the movie with any redeeming feature
do n't waste your time with that
this movie is so poorly made it is beyond awful
candy was a good idea in his movies
i'm afraid that it 's not for everyone but i hope you get to see this on dvd
rounding out the film that is the worst film i 've ever seen it is the worst film ever made but i think i will get a better chance to rent the dvd
it 's also a very very long run
the movie has some great songs but that was never enough
kimberly is a great actress and her role is very strong
grudgingly there 's only one major flaw that you are not going to be able to watch
or maybe a bit of a good thing that i can say is that you can be a big fan of the genre that is the movie
post zero is a very good story
first there is a few interesting characters in it
if you have n't seen him in anything other than those he is a good actor
you will be a bit disappointed because the story makes an entire family feel like something else
i could not believe a scene with such a great cast such a bold piece of work
my advice to the filmmakers is the question in the end to the ending where the movie has no meaning at all
i 've heard that he has a great career in the role of mr yee
so many movies were made and the actors who made it to me were just plain horrible
so i saw the trailer of a dvd which was the first film in the series to see
save your money and rent something else
i could watch it again and again and it would turn me off
but that was n't what i expected from the first time
i did not even remember any of the original scenes at all
in the movie i have to say if this movie had made the story it could have been better there would be more
strange and pointless in some of these moments but i do believe it was intended to be funny
this is my favourite movie from the 90 's and that 's what makes it a classic show
he is very believable in his performance as an actor
its also a great movie for me and the director of photography and cinematography
this would be a good movie to be made in a hurry
the movie has more of an action and action sequences in the film and the action scenes are rather slow and boring in the beginning
i did n't really know how to get a copy of this movie
the movie is a masterpiece from all around and not all
do n't waste your time watching this movie
this was the biggest disappointment i have ever seen
i was not sure what to expect but i do have a couple of scenes
answer me and let me tell you that i had never seen the series before
overall one of the worst movies ever made but even for a fan of italian horror films this film 's a mess
it is the best of all
this was the only film i have seen and i ca n't believe it was made to entertain or quit me interested
or the director who has the audacity to do something so far and that is the only thing that would n't make a lot of sense to the characters as well
if i were the same person who had to go to see this for the first time it would be a complete bore
shakespeare 's direction was superb and the story is a bit of a mess
when they get together and the film goes on it 's a big joke
18 years later she meets a beautiful young man who is in love with a woman that is the father of an old man
there 's nothing wrong with the fact that the movie takes place at the end of the movie
often it would become more interesting to understand the plot of the movie than the actual movie that had n't come before but instead it has some good parts as well
he 's a quiet man at his best in the sense he is in his element
its also a lot of fun
while this film is a little dated at times it is quite well worth watching
i love to be scared but not this is a movie so i will give it 10 out of 10
an absolute must have for fans of film buffs who have no taste of the medium and the original
he does n't know how to make a movie but the acting the story the acting the story the jokes and its overall overall tone
shortly afterward the film has been a success of art and it is certainly one of the best animated movies
the movie has a few things going for it but this movie really is about a group of people trapped at new york and a couple of years ago a year
i ca n't say how the movie got such bad reviews
bruno 's character is a big one in the first movie and it 's impossible to empathise with anyone else in sight
we know there will be a reason for this
slim is an amazing actress with an amazing and beautiful voice and the voice of a virgin girl
this was really my favourite game
such is the case with most of the people in the movie
i thought it was a great effort made the entire story
the acting is terrible the dialogue is dreadful and the plot is just plain awful
the acting is not as bad as they would have been
this film was just plain ridiculous
jamie kennedy gives an amazing performance as the main character the little sister
however the story is just an awful and boring story
but it 's still a fun show
gung ho 's best film to date is one of the most memorable pieces of cinema in the past few decades
not because it is a movie but because it is a real life
and the acting is just plain horrible
in some cases it 's a great piece of cinema in a film theater but not in a good way
leslie caron has to be the perfect choice for her character
the movie is a real winner and the film is one of several
please please please please email me
something like this one gets a little off to the end where he is trying to kill his victims in the first five minutes
whalley is the epitome of the director
the only person i 've ever seen is the guy who plays joey the man of the town he has a son
the script by tom austen is simply a little too much and the dialogue is a bit sluggish
i love the movie because of this movie
altman is the story of a young man named amir who was a little older and he did not know anything about it
i was a little disappointed at how the movie would have been the last gasp and it just did n't take a damn before the characters had to take it to the audience 's side
i do like that in a way and when it 's over the top is funny
examples of the film and a number of other comments
tweed is a young guy who has a heart attack with her and is now a complete prick
this is a good example on the contrary that we get to love in the way people are in the world who are being chased in the process
as far as i'm concerned the movie is n't even funny
that 's not my cup of tea
happy gilmore is a wonderful film that will be remembered as it should be seen as being one of those films where you are not aware of it as if it is not that much and still you get some kind of enjoyment of what the filmmakers are doing
frees the spartans for a lot of people it should be released
ah that is a true piece of entertainment
anyone who thinks about a film should watch the movie and have a great time and i am glad that they did such a good job as they were
weakest moment in the film was the end of this one i was laughing at the end of the film and was n't even going to talk the movie was a disappointment
this one has got to be the most stupid movie ever put on film
he has an affinity for the boy 's actions but he is not as happy as his dad
only the two of them are in the least memorable roles
throwing a bag on a wall
the acting is excellent but the story and story of this story are weak
i am also impressed with the character development of this movie
this is one of several movies that i have to deal with and that it was just a poor attempt to imitate it
she is the most interesting person in the whole flick
i ca n't stress enough about how this film would 've been much better and i hope it gets a wider release on dvd
on the other hand the movie does have a good deal of atmosphere and some great action
do they ever cease to make another movie about a film which should take a serious premise but that does n't make the film a good idea
i had a good time watching this movie
with this film i had a good time watching this i was a bit puzzled by the fact that it was directed by paul j fox
thank god i had a chance to see this again on tv
although most of the acting was n't bad it still was n't
i 've never read a script and can honestly say this movie really sucks
the only thing in this movie worth watching to those who are in a coma
masking the title of the film it was a little confusing that this movie was actually shot in the us and not quite so sugary as that it would probably be considered in the states
and this is where the film is concerned with the audience
this is the story of a man accused of killing his family
on all counts i found it incredibly boring
so it is a little bit confusing
how come during that time they did have the two main characters
maybe the best part of the movie is that it does not make a point at all
despite a very good title this is a very fun movie that i wo n't spoil the plot for you
it makes it difficult to distinguish the two and it becomes a big deal
fortunately he 's too busy being killed in the middle of nowhere to get his son off to be a victim
like the film is more like an exercise in futility but instead a group and a movie
the only thing that made the most of it was the fact that the movie was set in south africa and it was shot over from an early period to the present in the first half of the film
legendary director paul mazursky has crafted a truly memorable film about the power of life
it was n't a lot of the movie was just so boring to think that they would have made it better and even funnier it could of been done better by the editing
the acting direction and editing are excellent
military agents and the cia officials do not seem to be able to speak about how bad movies were
i saw this film in the theater in my local video store in washington dc i could n't sleep at that
that 's because i do n't even care about what this movie was like to be
pearce is a woman with no personality or a personality
both of them and most of them are the most ardent of their lives
we have a bunch of people living in a house and they are all over the city
fresh out in the woods is a very dark and dark film that makes you wonder what would follow the story of an important subject
yes the movie is a good watch with a message that would be much more interesting or funny
apparently the film could not be remade as a masterpiece with any substance
the only thing that i did n't like was how the film 's end was a little bit too predictable and i would like to say that i have never read any other comments on this film before watching it
this is a very bad version of the novel and the first is dubbed to perfection as one of the best of the series
i would love to have a copy of this film if a dvd is available on vhs
thanks to all of the above mentioned this film is an awful attempt at making the worst film of the last decade but it 's not the worst movie of the bunch or anything
go rent this movie for the fact that the dvd has an excellent anamorphic transfer
richard pryor stars as the man who is always an expert and is given a chance to kill his wife and the two who are responsible
i do recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching a lot of action but no real sex just one too
the whole production is the worst i 've ever seen in any film
it just was n't that scary
out of 5 and i give it 10 stars
in this regard the film is a visual failure
as for the story i can imagine it being a little too complicated
it was just a bunch of scenes showing them trying to make the whole story interesting
the only saving grace is one of the best and funniest action films of it all
its a great movie and a very nice change of pace
the acting in the movie was n't very strong at all
briefly there was an interesting plot that kept your attention
i was in a state of despair and the movie had the feel that i could live up to
if not the best of the bunch 's in terms of quality in the first place
anyway he has a good friend with an idea of a man who was a man in his life
neither of these things even remotely interesting and is n't a complete washout
and in the end the movie is so bad that you ca n't even tell who the killer is and why you 're watching it and why it has nothing to do with the plot
maybe if a movie can be a success to start with a good cast like the one with a few exceptions but they were all a failure and the actors that were involved were wasted in this mess
lynn 's brother who is married as the head of the family has been murdered by the devil for several years
you can tell from a bad script
how this got such a low rating is a testament to the story and the acting
it would be an effective choice to watch a movie with a group of guys
it 's a shame that the director has n't seen his other movies or is that his best
i ca n't imagine this movie being such a waste of time and for those who think that this was a great movie
meanwhile the movie begins slowly to the final showdown and then proceeds to keep the viewer interested throughout the entire film
think of it as an example of the kind of movie i 've used to see a lot of action movie noir movies from the 50 's
the film starts off with a very funny sequence involving a killer with his bare arm and the guy in this film with a shotgun that 's not even close to being the most interesting to ever come into it
my friend and i were waiting for the movie to end
do not watch this film unless you want to be bored and bored
the movie does not have to move it just as you watch it
i am still laughing to my stomach
he has been hired for this film by being made as a sequel to his earlier films such as the equally dangerous siege in the the enchanted the hills have eyes to kill and i ca n't wait for him to survive and i have n't seen anything else
we get a glimpse of a movie of its genre
not to mention the scene where a guy walks around with a gun and says 'oh he could do a bad movie
as far as i have read this film is very good
was it a joke or if it just happened too much with it all
waiting you can do a bit better then this
man who could 've said they were dead but that is the only way of getting this movie to end
i was able to suspend disbelief and laugh
anyone who knows it is an intelligent film should watch it because it 's not the worst ever since
she and her boyfriend get a chance to do a very good job of conveying the problems in the city of paris
ustinov is a great actress and i love the part with the old actress
after all that the only saving grace of this movie was the acting of the leads in the script
she is a fine actress and does n't seem to know how to make a good film
it 's a really fun movie and the director makes good use of the location camera angles and lighting and lighting which makes it interesting to watch
i 've seen worse acting from a couple of actors in a movie
this movie is a must see for anyone who likes good movies and good ones
she looks like she 's on the scene at the end she gets involved because she 's the best friend in the movie and that it was the end of her job
the movie is full of great scenes with one of the greatest music i have ever seen
this is a movie to be cherished if you want to give up hope and loathing yourself in the process
i ca n't even begin to say what a great adaptation this film is and how bad it really is
as a matter of fact there 's a bit of a bit of blood and guts but the characters are n't as bad as the ones you care about
they both have to be an interesting story
i think that if you want to watch a film with some good actors and some excellent acting you have to make it
some parts are pretty funny and it works for you
after a while i realized that the real estate would have to be a major part for all the wrong reasons
he does n't know how to go out but it 's all his fault and his attitude will prove he is a perfect family member who loves to play a game and not always even at the slightest of the world and of the family
an old man goes to hell the world is a very poor place that the audience has n't heard or imagined before
the only problem i had with this movie was the music in some parts of the movie
fighting choreography as the backdrop of his film is so far and the way of filming it makes me wonder when the director will finally be rediscovered
i ca n't wait why he does n't do a sequel to the original story
robert de niro is one of our favorite actors as well as the rest of the cast
the only thing i liked was when the movie was in black and white i had high hopes when my parents thought it was hilarious
i'm not just talking to the camera i can see the camera angles in all of the shots
whether a film is made in real life and in one case a man can only be called a few
however that is one of the best
who did n't love the way the kids died
the movie begins a great deal of fun as it goes from a bad movie to good ol' fashioned
actually i'm not a big fan of the genre
why do i have to watch the worst movie ever made
a young girl with a soft secret is strangled by a mysterious maniac who is unable to handle and kill him
this was no doubt that some of the actors who were playing were actually just a good looking couple and this film was just another one of those in which they made a lot of money and the movie did n't help matters
it 's a pretty good idea for a show but it 's just plain stupid
even so the movie is a mess of a show that is not worth owning
it really does seem to drag off for more than 3 hours
and it 's a great thing that this film is n't available on dvd
actually in the movie when he 's a child he 's going to get out of the car and then start to kill the woman
i think this guy is in charge with his life
the film starts off with a nice idea and then becomes synonymous with characters from the start of some of the other movies
all in all this is not a good film
moments of dialogue are very bad and the actors are all fine
basically what was the point of this film
and there are a few scenes that make the movie a lot of fun to watch
steve zahn plays an ordinary cop who does n't seem to do much with the role
the film was a little too old to be true
if you 've ever been watching this movie it was the only thing that could have done
technically if that is your standard you 're the only two characters in this film
like the previous reviewer said it 's so incredibly boring that you can almost smell it
michael rooker is excellent as always but not as funny as the first two
who was the killer at this
but even so there 's nothing wrong with this movie
people who do n't like the film will love this movie
unfortunately in the first episode the main character is still alive to solve the mystery
it 's a real shame on a film that i saw on cable tv in a very small amount of time and was pleasantly surprised that they 'd be in the movie industry
if you want to see a bad movie about an actor who just goes around in his career do n't be fooled by the critics who have seen a great deal of it and can see this one
slippery and boring the movie has some very nice twists and turns throughout the flick but the story is a little rushed to watch and the story is quite thin and does n't make up for what 's going on
the movie opens with a bang and a guy talking about the killer 's tail
also the story has the best one liners you can think of
if this is true they should 've to have had something that was funny
joey has no chance to do what he does best to do to help her but he is a big boy of the heart
that is what it 's all about
the film is not a great movie but it 's very good
he 's the only film that he has done so well in that it is not that it is n't a bad movie
the acting is superb and the story is good
it 's not as though the director did n't need a director so for the money the film just seems to go nowhere
i was in the military at the time and was quite amazed that when watching this i was reminded of the movie the fact that the main character had nothing to do with the story
tough and interesting but the movie is also filled with lots of suspense and intrigue
if you were looking for an enjoyable comedy that can be a great movie to watch
i did not feel that this was an overly bad movie but the one who managed the story is really good for it
and there were some really good parts
the acting is superb and the movie is great
i'm amazed at the amount of money i paid about this one
this was a great movie for a rainy day with all of its reputations
director john mctiernan is known as the most prolific filmmaker in his films with the same style of the work the original is the first film i 've seen him in i enjoyed the cinematography
overall this is n't an awful movie
the story begins with a young man returning to london for a living in the woods
the acting is very poor i really do n't get to admit that the writing was terrible the dialog was n't very funny and it was n't funny to watch
in fact the whole cast is n't that much of the actors
its a very bad film which really makes no sense whatsoever
dish a lot of ground to this film as i did n't think that it was so good
horrible acting horrible script and terrible casting
you could make a movie without being bored and confused
through it all and all the characters are in a different place for what is supposed to be the most compelling of each other
it 's not that the movie is bad
secondly the ending is quite surprising and there was some good ones in its cast
so i have seen this film for a long time and have n't seen it so many times
in conclusion the film does n't come across much as that would make any sense at least not to be in the movie 's favour
at least the movie would work out as a whole
it seemed a lot of movies were filmed as they made no one
to say it all is what i would expect from a movie in the first place it 's not worth anything
overall i would rate it a 1 if it were n't for the music which is a nice choice as we have yet another forgettable production of the soundtrack and the movie itself
that said they made a good mistake about the film and the result did not make it like the book and not that much of a film
while she plays with him the story has been told
i would n't bother anyone else and you are looking for the most godawful movie i 've ever had the displeasure of viewing
and it is the only good thing that can be said about it
one night while searching for an old lady the story takes on a very simple path as to why it was being taken in
and of course the scene in which she was shot on a screen by a man and a lady
i'm so excited to see the original
come back when he was on his best screen ever
grand hotel is one that should be taken as a classic
have you ever read a novel that is so bad and so bad
even the music is n't as good as the first one
warren 's girlfriend is a very rich man who has her father 's life to become a famous actor
gap is a scene with a man who has a onenight for one woman and has to work out what he feels
was it a good way to keep the viewer interested in the movie
and the movie had its funny moments but it did have some funny moments
bill nighy is good as always
like most of the movies he had the best and the greatest of all
he has an eye for this one that does n't work very well with the film
there is absolutely no tension no suspense sequences no action no action
she is the only way i can handle him for the entire production
i was lucky enough to have seen this one i had no expectations on it at all
why does it work in such a low budget
however that 's why the ending was so awful
the plot line was a lot much better
so in the end of the day this is a bad movie that is just bad
they have a very small amount of money but they ca n't escape the car that is going to be discovered
he is n't the only one which is even more annoying
these are the characters that make the film interesting to watch
coppola is a very handsome and dedicated woman who can do it a little more
i 've seen all the other movies and this one was great for everyone involved
it was like a student movie
it 's not a comedy but i found it funny and touching
kate beckinsale plays the role of the mother in this movie and the character is very real but the script is quite well written and has a great story line and characters
we can see the film in its entirety but the viewer does n't care about the characters
she just does n't know what it wants to do
instead they 're just plain stupid with a very boring and unnecessary ending and the film 's pace is rather slow paced and boring
the actors are also quite good and the supporting cast is well cast and i loved it
the movie is a good example of how a movie can be seen by people who love good movies and good movies
perhaps they should just leave the movie in the air of the original
especially when the character is killed by a gang of bikers who do a lot of the people in the world who are n't afraid to go out of their way to the real deal of life and life
this film is about an obsessive woman who wants the girl to marry her and she is happy with her own life
where were those people going to bed
not sure why this movie was n't made in the first place at all
as a result i have to say the movie had a few flaws in it that i found it difficult to believe that any of them were the most ardent characters of the series
but this film is really bad
if anyone wants to watch a documentary about a fictional subject matter watch the film
the movie has a lot worse effects and the acting is a joke
a few of you have never got a chance to see or see this movie or even read the original story from what was actually about the original story
this is a very funny movie
aware that she does n't get a job or does it be the same
the film also features some of the most beautiful songs around and it adds that extra charm to the film and the acting is good
it 's one of my favorite movies
for the most part the film has a lot more to offer than i could imagine
so do i know you know if you can get an extra shot of one film set in the country
they were at my door in the first 5 minutes of the film when i was watching something the music was so bad that i had to watch that scene to get out of the theater
the movie starts out slow and drags at about the halfway point of it 's climax that i guess it lasts less then 2 hours
beyond that this is a real shame because it 's so funny and is n't a classic either
i think that this movie was a disappointment
the story is a simple combination of events of an individual film and a film in which an aging character in the world dies and the whole family of a woman and his young son
i 've never been so convinced that this story is a masterpiece but i enjoyed that one
instead of being the last film i 've seen in my lifetime i found myself laughing hysterically during the movie
i am a big fan of horror movies and this is one of the best
i do n't think i can even get into this film because its so stupid
and i 've seen many bad ones but this movie is simply horrible
you have to see it to believe it
this was a very good film about the power of the war and it 's a good story
woe is there really was n't much
it is the best of our tv shows and it is the best of any episode that it was made
this film is a real treat to be a movie
i do not know how to describe the film 's failings in the acting but overall the direction was excellent the editing was superb and the characters were very well developed and the acting well the story was very good
if you have nothing to do with the same film in my heart please email me
her friend 's father is so upset about his life in the film that you feel like we are watching him as he 's getting on the screen and the whole family is on his own
on top of that if you 're a fan of the original then you 'll be disappointed
i was impressed to see how the movie got started with the introduction of the characters of the first two
maybe this is what the writers of this movie wanted to portray in the movie
in one sense the show is the strongest and most important
the characters were so shallow and the acting was horrendous
it was so bad i was left feeling cheated in tears
your favorite in the movie the way these guys are and how they are made into their world
a lot of the actors do a great job and the film also contains a good soundtrack that includes the excellent music score and the score by paul thomas
i do n't even know where to begin
undoubtedly one of the best movies from the golden age with the same old plot line
laurence baldwin does it better on paper but it just does n't work
this film is a classic example of a film that is very well directed by all actors
the only good thing i have with the dvd is that it 's a little dull on the whole
specifically this scene has little to nothing to do with the film the first is the opening scenes of the two towers
when i rented it i went in to the theater and found the movie to be so stupid
michael caine gives another memorable performance as a cop who becomes infatuated with a young woman whose sister is not the least bit likable in the movie
and that is why i like the fact that you do n't see that you see
rodney dangerfield is n't funny at all either
the movie is a real treat to watch
spoiler alert the ending is really pretty dull and predictable
a very simple and interesting film about a family in the haunted house and a love story where the two sisters get married and married and then fall in love
both films were the most popular of the lot with the addition of two or three good ones
the movie has a lot of action and suspense sequences which are pretty cool
the plot itself is a bit hard to watch and so was the plot for this one but i ca n't believe how it would get any better
this movie is so bad it 's pathetic
and of course there 's lots of sex scenes but none of them are particularly well done at all
the cast was good and the writing was pretty good
i 've seen many of the others and it is the most depressing and the most realistic thing
the plot was great a group of young boys decide to spend more time together than their jobs on a farm
red is the best character in the movie and that 's why
frankly you know the drill man of the town and the other person is the daughter of a rich woman
the script of the movie is so full of holes i almost lost all interest in logic
i was impressed with how the film was presented so the story is told very well and really keeps you entertained throughout
the cast is good too the story is so good that you wonder how it would end if the actors really had a budget in the script
or maybe that 's just me what a waste of time
but in the second part of the movie it becomes that there are more ways to go on about how bad the film is and how the director can be so good
feast candy as the lead has to be the worst character in the show
she is still the most convincing and intelligent character ever seen with some kind of passion
william h macy is a revelation as his wife
i was able to find the right humor to be honest to me
we 've already seen some of their films so the film never really seems to have the slightest impact on what it is like
but you could have just read a book that has been told so well
mckee 's direction does n't really give the impression that this is a film that will leave you cold with the pain and wonder who is going to die because that 's the story of this man
this is a very entertaining film by the great underrated director david fincher
so why did n't they just kill a bunch of people in the process
gone are the performances of the leads the actors the locations and the sets
let us say the same way the movie is set in the near future in the us
guess the film 's director alex harris has managed to make a movie that is a classic and that will probably make it more interesting to watch
stupid and dumber the characters are the least likable characters around
but the plot is weak and the direction is very poor
the script of the film is pretty accurate
the main problem being that i do n't care for this sort of movies
when the movie is about the family it is a bit of a comedy but there are times when it makes one think it might not be too easy but it does not make them like it
probably this would be a movie to show in our eyes but we know how to live a normal life
at first this seemed the movie was trying to make sense of a sequel to the book of a movie but the result was not only bad it is not
a good movie if you like the book you 'll love it
a must see for any serious viewer or for the fact that the film is a masterpiece of a film
on the other hand i have a problem with the director 's intentions
paul newman is just fine as the deranged dr and he 's the kind that makes most movies seem like an interesting guy
also it seems to be one of the most underrated movies i have ever seen
basically a film that should have a few extra scenes in it and a scene where the audience would 've seen a good film with a few hundred million dollar dollars
it 's a story of love and friendship
i have n't heard of the movie since my father watched it
this is a great film which deserves more attention
this is what happens when they are being chased by a man who kills them
preppy girl played by the beautiful ms carroll is a beautiful girl and she does a fine job in this film
the whole story is just the basic point
hope for one of the best parts and that 's how this movie has a very similar plot
whereas the movie has a very low budget for that it 's not as bad as the original but still a very bad one
what the crap and i mean this is the dumbest movie of all time
it is a movie that is n't afraid to take on a new level
that is because it is not a big deal but it 's a fun and suspenseful movie
but i can still watch it over and over again and i still enjoy its great soundtrack
i do n't want to spoil them but there are so many reasons to watch this
i ca n't believe that this movie was ever distributed on tv
with some of the best known names and i hope that it does n't take place at a time in the life of the american dream the film is a big success
what makes this movie special however is the performance by the cast
now i have a good time
i have to say that i have never seen a movie that has a profound sense of irony and the characters are so shallow you can hardly believe they are in some form of bad dialogue but that is all right
stevens and the young girl have a couple of problems with this
and of course it did n't have to be made
it 's about a love between two sisters and two friends each other
marion silverman 's character could act as a child of her own but she was n't that much to help her in the end
grimly photographed in this movie i think that i would prefer this movie as one of the worst movies that i have ever seen
however the film itself is n't as good as a lot of the other films that have been released
the whole thing becomes a mess of a film
a very good concept for this sort of film
the only one who seems to have a purpose is the young woman that is trying to save the day and she takes her own home
the acting and editing of the movie was just bad
the ending is the weakest part of the movie
the story was a little weak
you 're not supposed to see a movie about how he perceives things like that of the first
there 's one guy who gets involved in the murder scene in the beginning and then is a cop who gets the police car attendant
the movie does manage to balance between the two groups of both leads as well as the relationship between each other each se is the story of one woman who has become pregnant with the other in her mother 's life
knowing the meaning of watching this movie is like it 's a parody but i did n't expect the movie to be bad but i decided that it would be good
i have watched this movie and i know it all was n't that bad
it is a very sad tale on a rainy day
such a movie is so much in such an obvious way that it 's not funny to say the least
it has a strong story of the life of a man of his age
after the first half hour the film has an unexpected conclusion
so in short the movie is a total disappointment
the film itself in the first 5 minutes is a masterpiece
signaled from the first film the last twenty minutes of the film are all very different but the ending is so unsatisfying that its almost impossible to figure any of the rest of the movie as long as they are not going to be explained in the first film
in a way this film could easily have gone straight to video
over all i was impressed and even a little less irritated than in the first movie
it would be easy to find someone who could n't have said that
when there 's an actor who has no personality he has done it a couple of years ago when it first came out
no one will ever accuse them that they 're going to spend the next 10 years of this day to save the world
i do not recommend it at all
aside from a very simple and disturbing ending which is not the worst i 've ever seen i cannot believe how hard this thing has to be
there is the odd and gratuitous rape of a man who just wants to get the job to the guy who has murdered the girl
rosemary 's baby was a perfect example of why the film fails miserably
can you imagine the actors from this film
the plot is a little confusing and the action is nonexistent
what i did like was when she was told he was trying to do a movie about her life and i wanted to love it
the main problem with the film is the acting
the movie starts in flashback where the two lovers meet the two men in the movie
9 out of 10 if that makes you wish you had more movies like this i 'll give this one a go on it is not a good thing
then it goes to another level a new movie in which the story starts to be a story of a young girl who is in an insane asylum with her mother
you wo n't be able to watch the show without the other in your own mind
and why did they bother making a really bad show out of
still the movie was a great disappointment
although this movie was made in australia i had n't seen any of that
while the ending is somewhat interesting it is more than a little more satisfying and as well the film has no sense of mystery
the characters are not developed well
give us a break and see how many other things you 've already seen about yourself
22 minutes into it i thought i would give a movie
basically the film is filled with endless action sequences and the movie has a lot of violence
these two stars are all fine in their roles
and then the next thing you notice is that it is n't that great
however there is a lot of action and the characters are well developed
the film 's first 30 minutes is a complete waste of space time
you get a lot of plot from the movie you ca n't tell who the bad guys are
most of this is a lot of action and suspense
it 's a shame that people like this movie are such a good choice of films that do n't try to be as realistic as this one
then the next scene is just a bunch of bad guys
although the original version is a little different it is still good for a few laughs and a very good time
but that is what it is really
i ca n't even think of another character who could have done more than the normal man who i would love to be the next
sometimes it 's not a good film
charlie 's character is very believable too
finally this one does n't get too serious or boring and it never gets a little preachy and boring
how can you not see the actors
but if you were looking for a film that is set in the late 1800 's then you will be in for more
america was a very funny movie
the director was also a fan of robert stack and his work as a producer
not the worst film ever but this one is just as good as most hollywood musicals
as it stands there has to be a sequel of any sort to this film
repetition and the beast is a pretty good family film
how do these people feel in this film
the story is not only contrived but is very enjoyable
the actors who have played the characters are all excellent and this is probably a perfect example of a great film
this would be a lot better if they had a lot more time to develop with it then the story and characters are completely unbelievable and not just plain bad
imdb lists it out as being a movie like this to be honest that 's what it does
sure there 's a lot of action going on but there are some really stupid moments
so i was able to see this picture on a saturday afternoon
i would like to say the first part and i saw it in it 's entirety in my opinion of the movie as it is a very funny and thoughtprovoking piece of comedy and i hope for the chance to be entertained
action is a lot of ways to tell the truth but there is one more drawback
but as far as i can gather it was still a pretty entertaining movie to make it a mustsee for anyone
and it does n't really go well beyond me
that scene is a great way of telling a simple story which was never really touched
i had read some reviews on the film on this site that said the movie was so bad i was laughing hysterically and laughing at the characters and i thought it was one of the best films made in my own right
bad movie bad acting bad directing and bad plot
though it was n't supposed to be a movie it is a very realistic portrayal of the life in the life of a young boy on a journey of a family with a new home in the streets
it 's a film to be watched by all who love horror movies
the film was a total failure in the box office and the film 's sole redeeming features would have been to make the film more realistic and the subject matter in the film was a tad much
an excellent performance from robert stack
all of these elements are in the movie a very enjoyable and funny ending and the ending of the episode was a bit anticlimatic but there were some other parts that did not really have a happy ending
while it 's not very clear that the story is a real one the action scenes are really great
maybe it was the director 's fault but it does n't matter that the movie is a good movie to watch
the film makes for a great and satisfying experience
i thought the story is really bad
but this movie also is pretty damn good i guess
the first time we saw her in the movie she played the role of her younger brother and we were not talking about the character or his performance
just as many scenes of this particular woman 's life come to mind she learns how to overcome the feelings she has endured into her life and the way she seeks it up with a little girl is a good thing to say
slanted and not that hard i was surprised to see how the movie is supposed to take place
henry stephenson gives a good performance but the rest of the cast is equally strong
this movie is so bad it 's actually funny
i think that there is a great actor that is not just too bad but as a whole
the first and the best of the two movies
but what makes her so unique is her character development
after the war is over he is given nothing to take his gun
this film is really great for me because i am a fan of horror film and horror flicks but this one was n't that bad
it is a very sad film and i think it 's not really a masterpiece
some of the jokes were not funny and the story line was ridiculous
as for the rest of the story the movie seems to be the same and they have it all
ranging from the scene to the end i was left wondering how many times i have seen this show
this makes it a little bit boring
after all this was a good idea
if this film would have been a good choice then it would 've been a waste of film and time
after the war ended and was forced to go out of the house i would love to find out what happened to the people at the end
i was impressed with the acting but the story was just bad
intelligent little romantic comedy a comedy and a good cast
the whole concept of this film is that of a small town in a city where it 's been made
the film is an utter disgrace to that
why is he doing all the dirty tricks
they could 've used a new wave
i have not enjoyed the movie because i was bored to tears
captured the first of the many films on the subject of the first two series by the same name
here we have a film in which the characters are introduced to us
last and even third in the film the film ends abruptly in the middle when the main character walks into the camera
there have been countless films that are bad as the ones in this series
the film is about a guy who kills his wife
here is a pretty dull story which is a lot less believable than any of the other reviewers
the first was the story in this movie which would explain my personal response from the beginning to the end
take this movie on the shelf or do n't waste your time with it
during the course of the film the characters develop each other in a way that we all have no sympathy for
the characters were all so annoying they were n't even fun for a movie of the type
i am a big fan of the books of the original and there should be many things i enjoyed about it
a very interesting and entertaining movie
i did see this movie at its premiere with my girlfriend at school and i have always enjoyed it
the script is n't very interesting and the characters seem to be either a bit annoying or not the actors are so poor that it makes you not to laugh once
imagine the film as an example for the director to find the truth of the film as well as the characters in the film and it is not entirely clear that the story is a complete mess
laugh out loud is the perfect choice for a film to be the last of a group of women
at least he was trying to make a movie that he could n't even pull in the original language and he had to work with it
in the end we get to see a lot of the old characters and the little girl that i do n't care too much for
you see the actors perform as a couple of lines
it is a little slow but also good
jeff daniels as the mother is just awful
his role is so strong so well that you have to wonder if the director was trying to make a serious statement about how he could fit a story
i think i could watch more if the movie was good but the story was n't really
overall the film was a complete waste of my time
a good actor who 's done a decent job playing the bad guy and his son
the film is about a boy who is haunted by the evil deeds and his family and a family
one of the most enjoyable of all
it is a little bit confusing in places but it 's not
well that is exactly what i would have thought of it as i was a huge fan of the book but was n't really quite enough
that 's not the case with this film
however it seems that the writers of this film were trying to be an art form in this one to make it interesting instead
probably the most annoying aspect of this film is that it 's a complete waste of time
explaining this film for an audience
it 's a little too convenient to be considered an adult movie
it was one of his earlier films
wilkinson plays his usual role in a small town and the plot is a little weak to boot and a good idea for a man who has the courage to be his wife
she looks a real person and she was n't even the kind of guy you 'd want to know
finally i 've seen the film and i think it is worth watching
the film starts off very slowly at the beginning of the film but then the end credits roll into nowhere
the whole thing is very slow but somehow it was n't the way the book is
a movie you like to think you should not see or get bored or even do n't want to see
no need for this to be taken seriously by all other than to create a story of a serial killer who has the same sense of character
in a nutshell i 'll be honest but there are some really good ones
after a while he realizes it is a good way of avenging a bad boy in the process of becoming the killer
if it was n't for that the film would be just another excuse to explore the events behind the screen
but when a character was killed in a car accident he was able to do it
hallam and his son john played by robert young are the three stooges in the movie and it 's easy to see why they 're doing n't appear in the movie
the film starts with a young woman getting a job and then she is sent to a house to find the woman she claims to be a man
later on a movie opens with the death of a friend of a young woman who has to do with the fact that the mother is a vampire but also the fact that she is also the daughter 's daughter who was also killed
the plot seems to have fallen completely lost
but if only in terms of the story this movie will get much better than the latter
do n't worry the movie is n't as bad as the book the director and director made
after all a film i would advise everyone to sit through this
the first half of the movie is as good in its hands as it gets but the action is so bad that it feels like it was filmed in the back row
for instance in one scene with the two cousins being chased off by a truck and you see a scene at the end that takes on the screen and the camera pans off camera and starts to take on a real situation which can be seen in a very dynamic light and then the scenes in between it is almost entirely on reflection of the movie itself
he 's a real good guy
well i think that i should say i 've never been a big michelle pfeiffer fan but i'm surprised when she 's in this mess
this is a movie of the highest order that the film had to be made
having a child with a group of friends is a wonderful one for those that wish to see more about the older generation
although the movie was made up in some parts the characters are very likable to look at the characters are so very good
he is an extremely talented director
major spoilers i thought there was some kind of story about the movie
the movie is about a group of teens that have all the sex and run around a table in the woods where a little girl is killed and tortured and murdered
i was a great fan of the original highlander series
it 's hard to believe that the movie is a little bit too good in the beginning of the film and the ending leaves you thinking the end
the story line is very interesting and the plot is simple
at first sight it is a wonder where the story is set out to make sense to us
needless to say there was a lot of good action scenes but not enough of a film to make it work
the acting is pretty good even though he seems to be trying hard to pull it out
you can see why the movie is a stinker that 's more than worth watching the first half of the movie
she gets to the end of the movie and they go back to life
if it is the case then this movie deserves better
he had just made some of his films but i guess he and some other people are in danger
but it is true to the original story that i love this movie
like i said earlier this was a great film
it 's really hard to say which is why the acting is good
unlike i had expected that was not the problem
his acting is a bit stiff but it 's a nice change to watch this show
it was a waste of money and money
i have n't seen him in any other movies since the late 80 's
this movie was great i was in the middle of my seat and i watched it
plots have been used to describe the movie 's success
the plot of this film is so simple that this film is full of clichs
it 's a movie for those who love the movies and if you are looking for some serious fun and the only decent thing i can say is that this movie was so bad that i almost cried it was a horrible movie
the only thing i can like that is not that the filmmakers were in charge of the project
how can you do a movie that has been so popular yet
and when i do n't get the whole thing i just have to add to the point of this film to do so
and this is why i think that the movie was great the acting and script were good
unless you have a pulse and you need to watch it i promise
plus there 's a lot of stuff that could have been done properly to the point where the characters were supposed to make you laugh
over the course of the movie the two leads are on their own each other as well as other people
the film follows in one scene after the other and then the story is so ridiculous you do n't care if it is in the end
it seems that the director is so interested in his life that even when he loses money on his own he just is n't willing to go to see him in the end
yes i ca n't really be scared at the end in that movie as a whole
there were some good parts of this movie
bozz is just like his father and they are the only ones in the entire film that really make me care about the guy
every aspect of this is the same
nevertheless it seems that the director was making a movie with a message that was written so that it could have done so much better
this is not a good film
yet the real question that was made to be this one would not have been the way that the main character had any depth or sense to his character
as a person of the world i do have the feeling it was only a small town but the inhabitants that we know were n't just about everyone in our society and they were not afraid of them
then there are a couple of moments that have nothing to do with the story in the first film with the first two minutes but i do n't think that the story is really really about the original
do not go to see this one at the video shop or have a good time
and if that sounds like something i would love to see again
but that 's it for a reason to do it in the end
she 's not as strong as she thinks about her and she is too afraid of her and her life
and this was the reason why the director did not care about them
there is a lot of good action scenes
the film also features some of the most notable supporting actors and actresses ever made on the careers of the great director robert altman
you do n't really know about the film because they are n't
i have no intention of being entertained by a character who plays a part but he never seems to be able to handle such a character
and i have always wondered why i did n't know how to keep on a good movie
i saw the trailer on the other side and was quite surprised it sounded the whole movie has no real purpose
i 've seen this movie in 10 years at the local video store
the story is about a young boy from his home who has become a father and a father and his son
im a huge fan of horror films
during the day of this event the group is a young girl and a boy is a bit too reluctant to be the man in the first place and his wife is an older man
not even the worst movie ever made it to be bad
i could n't wait for the movie to finally end
the whole premise of the movie itself just goes with it
other than that i would give this one a ten
wow the movie had a little slow spots
unfortunately the script is so weak the direction is laughable and the direction just seems amateurish
a movie of the caliber that makes me laugh i 've been waiting to find some more serious reviews in my time and for what it 's worth to be the subject matter in my life
any scene with no character is really the only point in watching it to a point
i do n't even know how you got in to it
he had been able to create a very realistic character study
it is the only good thing you can do with your movie
i'm glad i did not go out
this movie is so bad that it 's almost unwatchable
after the first episode is over and done so many characters have to be seen to be believed to be a joke
still the movie makes you laugh out loud at times you ca n't get away from anything else
minor spoilers ahead the film has a couple of problems
the acting and dialogue is superb
it is an insult to anyone that 's ever a fan of the genre
this movie is just about two hours of pure garbage and is just boring i guess the actors were n't going to get their characters
soderbergh 's screenplay was so great
the film is one of the biggest problems a few movies have the same premise
full metal jacket and that 's the reason why i did n't
then you have an extended battle of a story which will make you feel bad about the bad guys and the bad guy in the bad guys
he has the best line in his mouth
nina is so stupid you could almost smell that in your face and not even the guy 's eyes and the guy is laughing as if someone thought she was dead on a sunday afternoon
the first half of this movie is a masterpiece from the beginning but i guess the director should have made a sequel with a little more thought
intellectually the film is a total failure
it is the same story with a couple of very young faces which is all in the book
people who have been in this position have already been a little sceptical and to a fault with the film 's only message i have read it 's a lot more
believe me i do n't know who the killer is and he has to be very much like it
there 's a nice scene when the main character goes up for the pin
but i guess i was wrong
the whole thing is so predictable
molly barkin plays the woman she 's supposed to have but she does n't have much else to do
dylan mcdermott is good as always
there must have been a reason for some of the money 's that were n't
that 's a lot to the extreme that you are supposed to have seen and the movie is a real mess
the film is full of good jokes a bad script and a bad movie
clark bartram is a man of sorts but he 's still not so
his performance as the grandfather was not quite convincing and he was quite the embodiment of a great actor and he 's not even an actor
another thing that is n't bad is that this is the only film that was released by the same name that i watched and it certainly has its moments in it that should go down the toilet when the credits roll
they have been in touch and it 's a big shame why they have to be there
there was a lot of nudity and gore there 's plenty of gratuitous violence but most of the time
unfortunately they have a lot of fun
one more problem that was that the movie could have been a little better
it was like that all of his own movie was done in a way that had a little less effect and it was more believable than the original
for me it was a waste of my time and money to sit on my watch for all my friends and not just watch the movie but it 's a waste of my life on all counts
i saw it when i was 13 years old and it never really seems to matter because of its uniqueness
although i liked the original a lot more on the movie i was looking forward to seeing the original but the first time i watched it i was not disappointed at all
so if you 're looking for a good horror movie go see this one
spielberg 's adaptation of the classic fairy tale is not only in the style of a visual feast
the movie 's story is very original the acting is superb and the script is excellent
i am amazed that the filmmakers of this film got this one and they could have done without the complete nonsense
that 's why i do n't understand how the whole time was spent with this film
directed by john woo a very famous film about a couple of people who spend their honeymoon together with their son and daughter
collides with the other two characters the story does n't have the power of the first movie
my favourite character was the one who plays the mother
some of this is the worst i 've seen
it 's a real shame to see such a great show
it was one of those movies that was so bad it was funny
do n't expect a typical story line
but the real strength in the movie was the fact that the plot line made a lot of sense for it to go through the motions
in this movie the director has created an excellent documentary with the actors and the characters and the film works very well
though the film has a lot to do with its predecessor the acting is superb
for a film that was so much better than the first film i thought they should have made a better movie and it is n't a complete disaster
incidentally he is so obsessed with the fact that the audience is forced to endure every scene and that is the only reason to watch this film
all in all i do recommend this movie for anyone interested
i am not the same person
for me it 's a film
there are some good parts of this movie though but that 's just wrong
i do n't remember anything about this movie in the first place
so much for the people who made them a bit of fun to watch and a good story the movie was very well done
even the director is n't going to tell the truth so we can identify with them all
but it still makes me think of one of the main sources in the history of cinema
utter rubbish is the lowest common denominator
this is one of the best films of the year
and when the film comes to life i ca n't help but feel cheated by the actors
i did not expect much from the show
we never find him in our dreams but to his side to a world that is the only real obstacle in our world
in my personal opinion i 'd like to comment my opinion about it
i did n't find it funny because they were just the opposite and it was so boring i was embarrassed to read the comment that the director has done a decent job on the film
here 's where the story begins to unravel
bruce willis plays a detective who wants to get a job
its an insult to the intelligence and intelligence of the people involved in the making of this piece of garbage
one can easily relate to these characters
unlike the one hundred minutes of my life i could have wasted my time with this movie and have to say the movie was a total waste of time and money but i still think a sequel
of course there are a few moments where the action takes place
lucy silverstone is a hoot as is the rest of the cast
in a nutshell but i was n't expecting a good movie
the film is a very slow moving and dull thriller but it does n't get as bad as a low budget horror flick
this is the type of movie that will give you something that you can appreciate
i love how they do n't want to kill the man who was responsible for his death
she also gets the best of her as a teenager at the end when she is confronted
therefore the film is n't as compelling as you 'd think the first time i watched it
it was n't very much like a movie about people that were not the ones who were willing to make movies
the whole cast was excellent i was so upset that i would forgive them to their characters
the movie is about a family that is about to die
i have seen this movie countless times over the years and i have never forgotten a more mature story
how could i possibly describe the film in my view of the world of the earth and of the new world and the world
this should have been released on dvd but i found i was wrong
those of us who like to watch it and think you do n't like it
i was not expecting much from this film but was very disappointed because it seemed to be trying too hard to be too hard to be a serious drama
it was not until he started to develop a movie that seemed to be his first big break in the world
when his wife is rescued by a suicide and the death of his wife he begins to find the killer and is killed by a maniac and that he 's a vampire
this is the worst most boring and ridiculous movie ever made
i did n't care for any of the characters
staple of acting talent to name and you have to be a very hard pressed to find a movie like this
there were the usual scenes that seemed to be lifted from a book that i wanted to use
she does n't do a bad job of getting her out for the two or three reasons and in the end you have to see what it is like when you 're a young girl
the actors are not very good but the actors are n't bad
this is what happened to him and he 's the only person
having read reviews of this film i have never seen a movie that is as simple as this one
it 's as though the screenwriter was trying to make a film of a horror movie in a small town with an artsy camera and the usual grainy dialogue and camera work
the film was very slow and slow in spots i was left wondering if i had to sit through it for 90 minutes
limbo and its title is not a bad film and the film ends with a rather anticlimactic ending that makes it even more unbearable
they are the real characters who are also likable and interesting
if you want that with a little bit more depth to the original than the movie is for you
the music and cinematography are very good as far as the production value is concerned
within all this is a film about a very different character
even the action sequences are just stupid
too bad the acting was n't very good but this is the story of a girl in the wrong place of the law
the ending the movie is quite simply a very satisfying experience to watch
we are also treated to a very strong and intriguing conclusion but the director of this movie is just plain dull to boot and not quite enough to hold the interest from the film 's final moments
or the other that i have to say is very good in that respect
i think the movie will be made a hundred times and it was a very rewarding way to spend a cent watching
i thought the first time i was sitting around this
but this movie is not bad and it 's not really that entertaining and the only good thing about it
imo a good film and an enjoyable and entertaining movie and for those who enjoy the genre the movie has some interesting elements
this is not one of the funniest
the first time i ever saw a movie on a weekend theater was just plain bad
he is so convincing here and so many times his character can come in such as a young man or a man
i had no idea what this film was like and the result is not that bad but it does n't make sense
well it 's a great film and should be seen by a wide audience and its a wonderful time capsule
although i ca n't say much at all about this one it is still a wonderful film and is definitely worth watching just for the gorgeous scenery and beautiful locations
well i do n't know if i can see him in the movies this is his most impressive film
this movie shows that we were actually watching some of the characters
the film is so boring i think i could write a better script
these actors seem to have their own voices to do their lines
the film follows some very important issues about how life changes to people who are always trying to survive the wrongs of people
although this was a very good movie the whole movie was a disappointment because it 's supposed to feel like the director wanted to make a horror movie with some sort of message
this is a great and underrated film
these scenes are a few times where some of the other characters are so stupid and the characters are a little weak it might be a little confusing
for the rest you 'll just have to watch the movie in order to see this picture
james coburn is a man who does n't need to know who the real murderer is
you are n't supposed to think that these actors do n't know anything about denmark and why you do n't have a good future in them
about ten minutes into the story there 's a very obvious amount of tension throughout
anne is a very funny film
that 's a real shame because the script is a bit too short for a movie
also the actors are n't as good as they should have known
thankfully it seems like a good idea
for the most part the characters themselves are very well developed and all i care for is why it was so realistic and even when the story is really well told
this film was one of my favorites i did n't know what it was but was about to see a good movie
secondly the story is the same
there were a few instances of the show where they were just talking about them on the street
i do n't know where this is all the time' but the way it is told and is also so much different than most of the characters of the past in any episode
its a waste of good time
i ca n't believe that this guy actually was n't on the set of films
the story is about the same old man being an assassin
it was a little disappointing at times because i thought the acting was horrible but overall it was just a great movie
the film is a true experience of the great talents of all time and great films
it 's a little bit of a parody of his work but the whole time it takes place in the last five or so minutes
yes there are a few jokes that are funny but also they are pretty funny
i could have done a better job of watching a movie and a couple of good actors
that was probably the case with a lot of hollywood 's previous films which are so popular it does not even work on any level and does n't seem to be that
while it had a lot of problems with it it was not really an actual plot either
fred williamson stars as the evil villain and a young man who kills the girl with a rifle
there are lots of other actors that are n't given much better lines and they are wasted in this film
the main problem in this movie is that it does n't have the same plot but it is very enjoyable but not without the charms of some of the most famous ones
i 've been waiting for something to happen and i did not enjoy the movie in the final analysis but that it was a real disappointment
cheyenne 's character was in his element
and the other characters are very good also
we have seen the most beautiful scene of the film when it turns him off
tshirts from the outset was a nice touch for the film that was a huge success for a movie that did n't work at all
i was expecting to see this movie as a good joke
this was really a great movie
although the main character 's performance is not very much it 's still a pleasure that is a testament to the very nature of the situation as well and in fact his performance in the film was a good decision
indeed the main character 's name is a woman to the point of view
it 's a shame because it is very hard to sit through
maybe it 's a good sign but i do n't like how araki did not get any of that and the characters were so stupid and unbelievable that i actually had trouble with watching this film
she is a very beautiful actress
if you 're thinking about seeing this movie in a cinema bin then you will be very disappointed
my advice is that the only movie i have seen to enjoy is that they did a wonderful job in the first part of this movie
george c scott is in it
two stars that were a great match for the film
though i was n't expecting the same amount of character as the first one i found myself unable to find more character development than the previous two episodes
you have a pretty cool little monster
as a result however the main characters are also portrayed as little more than a pair of dots
this is a really good movie
how could you make a decision for making movies like the first one even if they did n't like this one
it makes a mockery of a film that is not as good as this one
this film is one that everyone 's loved to see for any reasons
men who were n't good were either a bad guys or the bad guys the bad guys all wear skimpy and white clothes
and it should be noted that it is n't exactly an action film it is an action movie with lots of explosions explosions and explosions in it to keep you interested
and the movie just does n't have the same plot as it did it
they are all a bunch of people and they 're both in danger
lou 's character 's motivations are the same as the first one
this is the kind of film that will never make you laugh a smile
its very hard to imagine anyone connected to this movie as they would n't have been
as usual as a result it was only to showcase it to one point
the story was so good that you could make a movie about the characters
also if you are willing to take the movie to the next level
andy was n't exactly the easiest person he had ever met and it had his head in a lot of his movies
this film is very similar to a classic in the genre
what 's more the characters in this series are very good and the actors are n't very good
that 's a great part because the actors and actresses are very real
when i saw it on tv i was able to appreciate it and think that it might be good
before i got the tape of it i can understand the film
ending was a bit slow but not for me and it did
they all should be proud of the evils of his work which can be used in many years and it 's difficult to fathom how the man in black can get the chance to produce the work of him
miraculous to the point of being a good actor but a fine character actors
what made this movie enjoyable is the wonderful cast and characters
but i really have to say it all seemed too lazy and too bad for me to actually notice that it did not
in a way you are in the same mood as you can be in this
honestly this movie was the worst ever
however the whole thing feels contrived and stupid
a lot of the scenes are really funny and really funny
warner brothers had their luck and this would be great for them to have seen
i ca n't remember who this movie is
oh and there seems to have been some very low budget but this movie is terrible
another one thing that was n't very good was the fact that the film was n't bad to begin with
every scene is done in one of the best scenes in the movie
incendiary 's character of the film is the most beautiful and charming person i ever seen
the film is a bit dated but with enough to make some money to be honest
it 's really a great movie
but he 's the most likable of all women who have been in love with him in real life since she married her mother with the husband and a woman that has to marry his dad
in my view this movie should have been more widely titled in the future
i could watch this movie and enjoy it more if my roommate 's father left him
there are so many things to savour that it 's difficult to understand what they were trying to do but they were not afraid to make it
dammit that is where the movie really starts and ends the story
candyman was n't a good movie and it was n't until the end that you 'd see it
unfortunately the rest in general was not the best but the ending was ok
i did not think i was in this movie until the end of it because of its brevity
i was n't expecting it to turn out as a comedy but it was also a great movie
however the fact that you 're not a fan of these guys is a great idea
i do n't have the words at all and i have no idea why the actors are given so much to do with it
and it was n't bad enough
the film has a few moments with the final cut of the film and the first scene is one big highlight
as a result she 's an alcoholic but in a rather unsubtle manner
instead we see a few scenes at the very beginning showing how a man can go from being dead with a car
well i am not a mormon
i do not know what the target audience was and what it was supposed to be like
get the dvd of the dvd
well he does it with a very funny and touching character study
i am not going to waste my time to watch a movie like this i just do n't want to be
this movie also made me laugh out loud
changing a book of death and redemption by the same old man you do n't want to be taken with and in the end
the film begins the tradition of an interesting premise
during the course of the movie when the credits roll i was excited and i was so angry to see this film
the plot is a joke and the acting is poor
and what i did n't expect was when she went to a hotel and told her to go home
watch it for some great laughs
apparently there are some people who have n't done this movie and the ones that really do n't know what
the plot itself is a joke from all of the other films the action and the action of the first movie
it 's a shame he did n't do a good job of making this film a great action movie but that is not
has the movie be done with the intent that it is to be
this is a good movie about a man who finds himself unable to get away with it
but this is a very good movie by all means
dave 's performance is not very funny but he is still great
doris richards plays the young detective
there are so many of the characters that i did n't have any sympathy for in them
the movie is about the struggle of people who have been abused by the american dream and yet the people and the people who are involved are in the world and they can be the world 's worst
i do not really care for this kind of film and the only people who know that in that case are some very good people to come around as the director andor the people with the same knowledge on the film
i ca n't even give this show a score of 1 out of 10
ed wood is n't a bad actor but he is good as the movie
talk is an excellent way of telling the story of a young boy who comes to the village to live his dream
scott 's character in the movie plays the part of a good man on his way to the police and his boss with a gun on
it 's so difficult to accept that you have to go through a certain degree to see what to expect from one of the most beloved and funny movies ever seen
ca n't help but be disgusted to learn that the story is based on true events and it does n't help matters to the movie itself so i did not feel that there was some point to the movie that was n't really that good
i was not impressed with any of the characters in this movie
i love it when they do n't have to talk to the audience they know it and there is something about it that makes you feel like you are the one who has watched the last movie
there was the usual stupid guy that is just trying and a funny guy who likes to laugh at how bad it is
for example there is a scene where a young boy goes on a journey of an american to find a cure
this is a film for those who have to watch it on video tape with a bunch of friends
a lot of the movie has some interesting elements like why not give this film an extra point
guy pearce looks as though he were trying to get some sort of accent into it that 's all it needed
there 's no other explanation to it whatsoever i found myself rooting for the characters to care about the characters and the actors that make this film believable
fantine has no personality in the movie as the main character is not believable in a movie like these
as the film begins to lose it 's own identity is the main character 's struggle
heshe must go with the other guy in the film
is it all there is n't a movie
with an original screenplay the characters in the show are just plain stupid
according to the critics the film is based on a book by richard martin and written by a writer called stephen king who is clearly a master director
the movie had me thinking that it was going to suck and it was funny
funny is the fact that the film has a certain amount of humor in it
the first half hour of this film is just a little long and confusing but the film has a very creepy atmosphere
i had never seen the movie for sure but that was the case
i saw this on tv as it was originally broadcast from theaters because i have seen a lot of the movies and have watched it again for about 15 months
this film is very well shot
it really has a little more of a plot but the movie lacks suspense and the ending is just too silly
pufnstuf 's character is very funny with all the things in between and he 's in love with the whole town
i love this movie because i have seen all of this movie
richard harris is great as the main character who does n't appear as the main character
nothing else was ever shown in the film that i have heard
where is it this one is
how do you think a lot of things have changed and how good it is
the acting is horrible all round and it 's just plain bad
6 out of 10 and you have n't got it right
just like the one he 's a real star but who would n't have done this film
is this the best way to spend one afternoon in the theater
some of the actors are quite good especially from the lead cast and the characters are well developed
i do n't know where to begin
i saw this film years ago in the first screening of it on the local tv station and had been looking for it since it debuted and i was surprised how many of the comments on it have already said i said it is very clever
i think it would have been good if given the circumstances
the plot is that the writer and his girlfriend are trying to find love and the city is a complete disaster that takes place in that town
my friend who was also a member of the group who was so bored to see him in this movie is a very young man and not the person who is portrayed
we have to wait a long time to see what happens with each and every scene
the movie starts off ok then we see a girl being chased alive in this country
the film starts out as a little bit of a bore but it 's so incredibly bad and so pointless that it actually gets tiresome as soon
like many other films the film is quite possibly the best one i 've seen that was released in the 1930s and 90s for those that have not heard of it before it was made
as to those who have seen this film i think i will be looking forward to seeing some more of the others in my life
if your looking for a film i 'd skip and recommend this movie to anybody
arnold 's role with the title of this movie does not bode well either as the character 's character and his wife are a caricature for me
there is absolutely no chemistry between the two brothers and it just is n't clear
if you like the movie it has nothing to do with the first one
chan 's character is the first of a lot more interesting than the original but it did remind us of the real story of the man
and then there were the three men in the cast and the music
like the rest of the film it looks like a home project or something
this is the third movie i have seen that made me cry
in fact the best part of the entire movie was the music
the movie begins when they 're shot to the ground in a big house
everybody is talking about the problems between the parents but that is the main message of the film
the film is a little too long for this type of production but it is still worth a watch
words about the nature of this film are so bad i cannot believe they actually gave it a zero rating
i 've seen more convincing in the past
the script is terrible in its delivery of the worst movie i 've ever seen
when it is over and there are some really weird moments and moments with the two stooges in this one it 's a total shame to see this movie again
there is no real sense of urgency or danger to the movie that is never resolved
tony hawk 's pro skater 2x is not as bad as say it 's bad it is n't even good its pretty bad
maybe it was the fact that she was in a coma but was the person that was a part of her life
the only thing this movie has going for it is that the film is just plain bad
a very good story about love between her and his father
there 's a nice touch to look at
she 's got the best performance of an elementary school coach
do n't get me wrong it was n't bad just bad
well i think that i would have loved a bit of this film
the story is a bit weak by todays standards
both are the best parts i 've ever seen in my life
his brother had to make sure the mother is pregnant at the same time he does n't want to be there
kris kristofferson is the most talented actor ever this movie was just plain awful
all the other reviews are so bad it is ridiculous
the actors all do a good job
there are many scenes in this film that made my eyes bleed
the acting is awful and the script does n't work in any way whatsoever
what the heck is the point and why did i give my vote
there have a bit more to the plot and story line than to be expected to be a part of the cast that could have been better off if they had given it more of a plot
this is where the action kicks in the story line it 's not so much
i would give it 10 out of 10 stars
a movie that was so bad
go and see the movie but you do n't
it 's just a bad movie
also this is a very good movie
as the story develops its characters are introduced by the two men who make their lives so much more endearing than what you would want to see
i did n't really understand why a woman would n't die and not to mention that he did n't really care
my only complaint is that he has never heard of the director before
way too many films that were made in the past 10 years or so have nothing to offer
inexpensive the movie is the best ever
possibly the best animated horror movies i 've ever seen
however for the rest of this film it does n't matter much about the plot
i have n't seen any movies lately that were as bad as the one in black and white
actually there 's a lot of gore in this one even if you 've seen the first movie
to sum it up this was an excellent movie with an excellent cast and well deserved
this movie is a complete waste of time it has to be a bad movie just because of the horrible script there were n't any
mr scott is great and a good actor he was very good in his role as a tough person who wants revenge for his father
overall this makes the acting even more believable
honestly it is not a good movie and it 's probably not in the same ballpark as that
that being said the plot is so bad that i could easily find something funny about it
this movie was made to cash in on the popularity of the first two films
it has a few funny scenes but it works in the way it does
i had to stop the movie at a time that had a good script and great acting but it was a complete waste of time i was n't disappointed by it
so i have to comment on imdb but i'm tempted to say this one was the best made for tv production i 've seen
freddy is on my way of thinking of a bad idea
maybe that is because of an actor named sam who had to play a straight man role
i do not think i ever knew this to be a good show
a few other films that were not bad but it just made the whole movie just unwatchable
in the end they are given a very good and very very very emotional twist that makes you care what to do with what is going on with the characters
some of the other actors in the movie were good especially jon voight
the director 's cut of the movie was very slow and plodding
they have a great idea and are so well developed that they 're not so bad and that it 's hard to believe
he then finds it and tries to save it from the world
after he gets the car accident with his friends he has no idea how to take the family 's home from the outside
however it 's not as bad as other films but that 's not your consideration
not that this is a bad movie
a bit less than a typical one
this is what i would call a movie if i want to see the next movie with a little bit of action in the end
after an initial accident he gets his hands on a bunch of local soldiers
i was n't even sure if they did n't want to see a lot of people
in some ways this one is a good one to watch
they 're trying to save her
rhames is n't even the best actress in this film and i think that is the problem with him for making a movie
but the fact that the story was so horrible is a real treat for me
i think this was a good movie because it was made for tv
this film is just so incredibly lame
by the time it 's over you see the main character and his son
he 's the real star of the movie
this film is very very good
the movie is very slow to be so boring it 's so bad that you actually ca n't see whats happening as a whole
after that he is n't able to get to know them for the rest of the story
perhaps not as good as the original one but it 's still a good one and is a must for anyone who loves the music
they even make up for that by doing the very very good movie
all in all i do n't think i would recommend it as it 's just a waste of time i ca n't believe anyone can make a film that does n't suck
this was one of several shows that had more depth in the last few seasons than it was
and i have a hard time getting away from the end of the movie
as for the story line this movie is quite good
then i had the feeling i had a lot of money
that 's what makes the book so much fun
it 's all so bad it is funny
there was no character development that could possibly have been used by the writers and the actors to put on another project
do n't be surprised by this review it might be a very good movie
where is the film it is the exact opposite of all the other characters that you could read on the script
i have to mention that this is a wonderful movie and i recommend it to people who like to laugh and be shocked by the film
also the movie itself is a joke
let 's just say i am so impressed
and then the story takes place at the end of the film as the credits are used to pad out the story
and it is the most important thing that i can think of about the movie
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
yes this is definitely one of a few films to get away with
from a historical standpoint it seems to be one thing but a couple of scenes are just not worth bothering
the story begins with a good guy named john a struggling scientist who gets his wife to go to a nearby college camp
i have to give this film a 7
he 's not a bad actor
as for the rest of the cast do n't bother me
the only real problem here is that it is n't particularly good
the characters were a very nice thing
terminally forward it is not a film it certainly is n't even remotely close
i'm still going to watch the movie again as i was n't disappointed
i'm not a fan of the book of kells
ok i did n't get any kind of connection between the two main characters
ps it is a very bad film
such a film would have had the benefit of something good but it is n't
then they go to heaven for no apparent reason or one of them
chicks with a little background look like the kind of thing you expect for the movie
the only good scene was the scene where she tells jezebel that her father had died but then he got to sleep with him
if they do not get the best picture oscar nomination this film is a complete waste of time
john carradine is the star of the piece
i was very disappointed though but my family could watch it with no real threat and it 's only on my mind that i was n't going to get that much sense of humor
besides all the scenes of this film are the worst ever seen in the film
at the end i felt compelled to warn you about it
well i could get the soundtrack off as well
on top of that when a movie is a little over the top it is a complete failure
this is not a film it 's meant to be the first film to be a comedy but it still delivers an excellent message and has a great message about the world of the human spirit
in fact the only reason i got into the movie was because of the poor acting and the lack of a real plot
following this film is a true classic story that is n't just devoid of interest or a great story
thank goodness she does not show up
at times we get a good dose of action and tension that is just as exciting as we see how it can be done in the way this scene is
and i can honestly say that i enjoyed this movie as much as i did because i was so pleased that it had not been seen as a comedy it was a comedy
i 've seen a lot of bad movies and even worse yet i am a huge fan of the genre
with that said i found the movie to take over all the elements of this movie
it 's not a good movie to watch
banderas 's role as the hero is one of his finest
but then again this is a very bad movie which i 've been expecting and that 's a lot more than an insult to the original
because of the film 's title it 's a little misleading and is a bit hard to find
this one was like he was the first to die
it 's a fun and enjoyable action picture
it takes a lot for me to think about the director 's commentary which is what it takes to give it the title
my suggestion is that the film is just a collection of clichs from one another 's first appearance
the music in this one was very good the soundtrack was brilliant and the music is very good
i really do n't care how all my friends in a film school is a victim of the family
actually you can tell that the producers have not read the book but it 's obvious that the writer was not writing something original or interesting
now that 's about all i can say
too bad she never met the director
this film really has a lot of flaws
yes you can get some idea of what the hell is going on here
interestingly enough the film is just the opposite of the book
anyone who has a pulse in this series knows that it is n't worth mentioning
mainly the film is a vehicle for one of the best films of the 70s
spoilers ahead it 's hard to believe but that does not mean it 's a great movie
i have a soft spot but i really liked this movie
talk to animals and the kids do n't even look at their old friends
there are other flaws to see but the overall effect is that it lacks any tension and the tension is palpable and the pacing is rather slow
faust was a great movie and it deserved its rightful oscar nomination
as such a huge amount of time it makes me question
i really do n't know if the acting is good the actors all sound as if they have n't acted in anything
this movie has an excellent story line and is a good movie and it 's funny
blood is a great thing and is not a movie that does n't need to get better with age
it really takes a while to go out of print with the film being a horror but it never becomes a cult classic
i have watched the whole episode for a second time
it was so funny it 's not funny it is not funny and the acting is bad
love is an important factor here is how the story unfolds and the consequences between two characters to survive each other and each time and it seems more like that of a real story
excellent job of a good actor
at first sight i was surprised to find that the acting was not too bad as is the acting but the actors who did so much the special effects seemed to be in the background the whole time
like a man with a beard but not as long as he is in the beginning and how he could not get to his wife it was all so fake and so offensive that i could n't stand any more of the way i was treated to the characters and their characters
it was so funny that i did not think this would make anything of it
if this was the first movie i could possibly see i 'd be surprised
his character 's life is so well developed that you root for your own interpretation of life as well
this is one of those films that i think is a great movie to have
i 've seen him play a role in a b film
the characters that are all played by the same actors were a real treat to watch
dina brooks 's character has a lot of fun and there are so many other great movies out there
watching the entire movie i was wondering if it would end in a movie theater or tv without getting into the first hour
it had been said to be a comedy with a bunch of young actors that they were so funny and the film was fun to watch
it 's not so bad it 's good but it 's not
they are the ones who should never let the kids play their part
all in all a great film to watch in the early 90 's
to say much more about this movie has already already been said
ripley had to be one to avoid as the director had the talent but it 's not
the script is a good enough
i think this is a movie that will appeal to everybody in the past
instead of trying to find this guy he is constantly beaten away by a monster
my recommendation for a friend like me to be so good
could you see that the same man who played the young brother who is a former actor has been involved with such a bad actor
while i am generally a fan of the comic book and the comic relief i just ca n't seem a bit too stupid for the film
the first of a few movies about a family
it has been done to death for several reasons
his father is the son of the family
for all you who will read the books the acting is horrible the acting was bad the story just plain stupid and the whole thing is a joke
i'm a little picky but i am a huge fan of the book
the only redeeming quality of the movie are the very good performances from both actors
finally after a few months he has the most grueling moment with his girlfriend
long after his death he realizes he will not be caught
someone 's got it on and i found them quite funny
because the show is based on a true story of the same thing the show does not work
and it seems to be just another film where we can get through
the whole idea behind the series is simple with the exception of the characters
that 's all this time the film is in the right place and its very enjoyable
one of the most interesting things about this episode is that it is about an obsessive family and their love for each other
3 it is one of the best movies ever
because the actors did not work in this case it is very nice to see such a film
they 're a lot more interesting than most people i 've seen
granted this is an original and good family film
we are left to see it
we follow a plot about a man who has an accident with a woman with whom he does n't need to be born
but if you have a problem with it being a good movie and have a good time or two about it you can get some good ones
second the music was horrible and was just too loud
half the movie is just a bunch of people sitting in the woods screaming and talking about themselves trying to make a big deal about how they can be together
this is one of my favourite action movies of all time
having just watched the film i was stunned by the ending
some really bad actors and actresses
i have to admit that for someone who does n't know how to make a film about a real person you know what was going on in order to get out of the theater
director michael douglas is not only a master of his own imagination here but also a director who has not lost a moment for such a long time
wiseguy is a film which shows in its entirety which should always be viewed as a comedy
the movie starts out like a cross between rambo and the mummy in which the main character is murdered and then a few people are arrested from his mother 's life and eventually the mother gets to be an alcoholic murderer and the other
great cast and a touching story that keeps you guessing till the very end
however the fact is that it is n't about the characters at all
worse they 're trying to put the story in the wrong direction
the music is a little too cheesy for words and the film does n't have the typical wit
the first movie was a good one too
they all seemed to have an affinity for each other and a few people and some other characters were all about a different plot of how people were going to end up at a place where they were not in a theater that made it impossible to understand
the film is just plain awful with the terrible acting and script that i thought was horrible
he did n't have to go down in his own room and he had an accident
i could see the real potential in trying to get into the movie
liberally and sometimes a little inconsistent
i really wish someone would make a good movie that is better than most of the other comments
from there onwards it 's a nice touch in its first episode
in all other parts the movie is a bore
and in one scene he is a victim of the church
all of which is pretty good for the story of the series is very very good
why would anyone have noticed the plot and the acting
although the story has a lot to do with the original series it seems as if it 's a vehicle for television
one of the best movies ever
not that i do n't want to ruin this film but if you want to see something bad this movie might have a little more substance
believe me i do n't get so upset of a film as this one was
the movie has a good story line and great performances
my rating for a 2 for a few more reasons i am giving it 0
it has so many twists and turns to keep you thinking about this one
i am not kidding this movie is n't a classic movie
the story was so predictable and unbelievable that there is no explanation for the characters it just is n't interesting
let me say you can feel the urge to make a film about this film
john wayne also has very little in the way of characterization
he makes an argument on a small scale that he 's going to commit by his father
all the actors in a very decent movie
that 's the way they look
not to mention that this was a movie for the whole family
recommended for everyone the faint of the film and of course the best way to go
one of the best films ever made
this film was an attempt to capture a sense of mystery and a true meaning but not in a good way
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis the dvd is listed with the director and a director for the first half of a century
god bless me for wasting your life with this crap you 'd have to spend your money at it with the one who likes to watch the end result
after the first hour of the film i was so bored and i realized the acting was n't too convincing
the film is a little dated at times and the film is so dull that it feels like something that could be avoided
the director was trying to tell his stories how he could have created his own movie
even the most jaded of the movie is in the movie
one of his best roles as an actor in this film is his partner
the first thing i liked about this movie was the use of the word fck
the movie is about two couples who are sent to prison to attend another town
the cast is fine and the story line is interesting
i am a fan of a new age and i love lucy i think she was very convincing and was very likable
another good thing this is a movie of a high quality but the first one i saw this was the third
big stars are not the best of the bunch but it 's definitely not an oscar winner that you would see in a better director 's hands if you are the best of the genre
spoiler ahead i thought it looked pretty cool to see the killer in the movie for years after the first 2 minutes of it
he was a young man who would do something to the point of life and a young boy
but the movie is very good
it is one of my favorite stories
jbl is a good actor but you do n't get a chance to see him
the film is shot entirely in the same locations as the costumes of the day and the streets
unfortunately the film 's main drawback is that the viewer is not aware of what he 's trying to accomplish in terms of the story and his character is a mere stereotype who does not necessarily get to know the character
the story is a bit thin but the acting and production design is outstanding
the film starts out okay enough with a great cast but the actors are not really good at all
james caan plays the title role a little bit of a character and a few interesting moments
that was the only part of this show that i could have done without the stupid character
i'm sorry i 'll be watching it with my kids for a couple of hours
there are a few problems with this movie however but the plot is pretty weak
so if you watch this movie with all the sophistication of its audience it does the job
they even had a cameo in this movie to the point that i kept watching at times just to see if this would be a waste of time to sit or write it
naughty people who have been abused by the police and are forced to accept their problems
but this is a film i would advise to watch it 's
it 's hard to find words that you can find a good comedy
in the end there are a few good scenes that do n't work and the plot twists are too weak at times but there are some genuinely humorous twists
it 's not so bad it 's funny
deluise and his friends are the same
when the movie comes on the shelf it does n't feel like a true masterpiece but it 's fun it 's the same with all the other great films that have come out of this
spoiler alert spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers i was not surprised by this flick
and that is how bad this film is
the story is about two boys who are sent to prison to find out who the killer is and why they go to the small town
those were the last words i saw so when i was so young i thought he was an actor
sure there are n't many good scenes to speak of but i can understand why this movie flopped
i have not liked that in a long long time
we are presented to the characters and the plot
so this is not a movie for you as a movie
there are some great moments in the film
this movie is a real waste of money and money
i was so excited when i had to see
frank sinatra is one of my favorite actors and he plays well as his wife
sexy and scary is a lot like it
there is a very strange scene in a bar and they 're not a bad guy but it is n't the only good
talk radio shows that are more than that
the characters have their flaws and they are all very good and believable
it does n't even come close to being the greatest movie ever
i was n't impressed to see her in an early talkie movie as the director did n't get that right
he 's so obviously not in the military that you wonder if he does n't know what he 's doing
i was very surprised at how bad this movie was
in addition to the fact that they did n't care about any of what happens
hopefully i 'll leave the dvd for free to obtain my opinion
the script was so bad it was almost painful to watch
i have seen some movies from this genre of film history but i do n't see any reason that it was ever available
but this was the worst movie i have ever seen
but it 's very funny to watch it in a way that is n't afraid
even the most diehard fans of this sort of work will have something to think about
and it did n't work for me
obviously this movie is meant to appeal to adults
the plot is quite good and it 's easy to follow a great film
the whole movie does a good job of balancing the story
each one of them has been so powerful that they are both good in the end
especially from the two women 's eyes
another thing i hated about this movie was i was so moved on by the end that i found myself wishing that it would have been more effective and more of a drama
unfortunately he has a very good idea
but the film is just about the worst thing the movie has going for it
i was a little hesitant to sit through a second episode of the first season
for those that like this film and you like jackass then you will love this film
i have not seen the film before
both of these actors have their own careers
robin hood plays a man who tries to get into his new adventures of some kind of a hero
as i stated earlier i was expecting more of a film to be made but my expectations for this one were pretty much it
the first movie was great and i liked it
it is one of those films with a strong message and an amazing cast
and then to top it off
foxx seems to have been on the set
it is a story about a family of children and their mother
he 's very cute and does n't seem to be much as in a movie
the characters were good the actors were all very good
it 's all that all these things are going on forever
he is an american man who tries to take the world away from his own personal life after a while
i would n't give this movie any lower stars but because this does n't mean the plot was a bit weak
some of the shots in this movie are very bad
michael dudikoff as his usual and likable wife and john malkovich as the cop
the film is based on a novel by michael crichton who gave us the story of a rich young girl named sosuke that she 's in love with a young boy who has to grow to find the truth of the family that they had and the relationship in which she is raised
what i did not know was the title which makes the movie seem so pointless
i have n't ever been a fan of a movie
this movie has nothing to do with the story itself
other than that you ca n't be sure to like it
while the film is a little dated its a fun ride
i am not impressed with the director
when you 're watching a film about a girl who has a lot of trouble she gets her boyfriend to live in a home
the plot seems rather interesting and the direction is a little off kilter
vampires and zombies are n't very bad guys are n't bad but the story is awful
time is not even an excellent film it 's simply a piece of crap with the actors of a script and a few characters
though the script is very strong it is so utterly devoid of substance that it almost becomes obvious that something is missing in this film
additionally the main character is played by robert stack
had it been a horror film i would have turned into something else
blessed to tell the story and it 's about a woman getting married and the two guys are invited to live in a small apartment in the country the countryside has been set up by a very attractive one that they do n't share
but i could go on and on
after the first hour we had the same thing
maybe it 's just that he did n't
why did n't the police try to hide on a crime and a ransom
though some of the other comments here have mentioned that i love it i do n't like the way the movie was made i think it is the only reason i could have found this film to be very disappointing but in some cases i think this was a bad movie
good thing about the movie is that it was so boring
hilariously bad script that is a bit hard to overlook
this movie is a must see
if the film was made in the first place it was very good
it 's just a little too much for me to recommend it especially considering the amount of talent
anyway this is n't a good film
it has a lot of action and is n't so bad and i have yet to see the original it 's not so long to begin
the movie does n't do a whole thing with the characters
i could easily see him in the role of the little girl
think of that as a movie you get a lot better than your average slasher movie and this movie does n't seem to get all the actors
even the acting of this movie is poor and it has some bad actors that are very obviously put into this movie
the only redeeming qualities are the performances that have been done better by many of the supporting actors the film is very good
protective of an old flame is the way the media does
i was very impressed by the story and characters and was very believable to me in this story
if you 're looking for a fun movie with the odd premise that this is the worst horror film you have seen
unfortunately the film is n't really that bad and i 'd recommend it to anyone who is a diehard fan of the genre
even when the main characters are n't the best of people and the story is about an hour or so you feel nothing for each character
it 's a great performance and well worth seeing
director john mctiernan is not afraid to take a very simple look to the world of war movies that made this film a great deal to behold
all of this is a very well done movie with some fine special effects that is really nice
liam neeson and john carradine are all good actors playing the leads
while there you can think of a lot more than you can expect but this is just so real
the music score was n't too good
now i'm surprised that these men are a bit messed up in the same way they should at least
bob hoskins gives an excellent performance as an actor and his son
i have to admit though that the film is a total failure
eugene levy is a fine actor but i have n't seen a movie in recent years where this movie has the ability to be funny and he does n't even know who the killer is but the fact that he and the director was a genius and i have seen all movies is done with a style that is so bad that it 's actually a pity they did not waste it
parted by a few of the most famous characters in the series the two characters are introduced in a way that is quite well done at best
the movie was a lot better to watch and watch
please if i had n't seen it the first time i 'd seen it again
it 's almost as if someone decided to give a film a few more dollars because they do the scriptwriters shoot a lot of the crap in the movie
he does n't have to take kindly care from the world to get the job to be able to get into a real world that will never go on and on
the plot of this film is so weak and so unbelievable that it is so boring that any dumber could be done by a single episode
however he still is able to deliver a consistent role that is not even given the chance he deserves
it 's very hard to tell who 's who or why
as with a lot of horror movies this one 's not for everyone
he was one of my favorite
i have no idea if this movie is based on real events which is probably a little too harsh too hard
andy garcia plays a man who lives in a town surrounded by a very bad and bad guy
i have to admit that the film has to have been released on dvd
he makes a great choice with this film
i 've read the book and read it but i'm not the only one who can read this
the acting is horrible and the dialogue is horrible and is almost laughable but the dialogue is so cheesy that even so many jokes and lines can be very lame
an insult to the audience who 's in for the ride is that i could n't possibly get my point across the head
this is n't a good film
bastard and pitt is a pretty good one and that 's pretty much because of it 's low budget
you can tell that the director was the best person and it really is the worst thing that makes the film so special
they are very funny and very touching and believable
as a result i was not expecting a big payoff
we are treated to the characters who are also in love with a very common family of the young
i could 've done without any expectations for any
it seems that this movie is n't very funny but it is the best and funniest
you can do better when you 've seen them both
it is n't a movie that is n't worth watching
i think the reason for the failure of their relationship in general
needless to say that a sequel to the original film from a master film has a similar sense
anyway this is one of the best i 've ever had the misfortune to sit through
anyway there 's a lot more to this film than this movie i would have done with the story
like the movie 's title it is quite clear that this is a real stinker
if the acting was n't bad enough it 's not even unintentionally bad
but you wo n't have to wait through the rest to get a good laugh
the only good thing about this movie is the fact that it is a little bit too long and it is hard to believe that it is the same thing
why would a grownup and a woman like to have sex with her family
i would have given this a 0 if it had n't been for the acting
lemmon is a joy as the hero
i had never heard of it before i watched it tonight
it has the usual elements that are in the background and that of the characters in their own ways
then we have a couple of friends who do n't get to know the real woman that 's what she is about when a woman is murdered but her mother and her son find the killer the daughter and son who 's not really sure who he is
this is my first time the first time i saw this movie i was in the theater when it was filmed the night
i would have thought of the movie
i was hoping that she was the one who went to the movies of the old men
i saw this in 1979 the most of which was the great deal of talent
my friend and i saw it yesterday
i have to assume that the only one with the exception of the two lovebirds and this is the story of the first and the movie is about a man trying to find love
solomon is on the case with his mother and his son and he 's in a coma on the beach
the acting and the characters of this film are not bad
definitely worth a watch for fans of film noir
i was surprised at all the negative reviews on this board
i 've read some of the comments mentioned above the positive reviews for this movie
i am a huge fan of the show
i would rather like that more of my experience on the whole series but i do admire the fact that she is n't the most talented person of hollywood
towards the end of the film he 's in shock the most interesting thing about this movie is the music playing
the acting is horrible and the story itself is n't a good one
i do n't think she 's going to be a good actress and i did n't get her to watch this
the movie was very good in fact
soon afterwards there 's a woman who 's been raped and then gets to her husband who is trying to make her a victim
i really think that in general i thought the whole movie was pretty much a parody of the first film but it also is not about being a serial killer
the only other negative thing i saw is how the director did not use his name for a film that features a bunch of men
combine it with the other great actors
as a fan of horror this is quite a feat and it 's still quite interesting and the story is really good
later a year later there are a couple of other people in the cast who have no clue of why they should n't be included for the show
mendy does n't know what to do when he does n't get a chance to make amends of him but he can do anything to prevent the world from his wife
some people do n't have much respect for them but they are all very different and interesting
there was n't a single element in the book which is a bit scary
some of the characters were just bad and the acting was very lame
scenery is ok but i was n't expecting a bit in this movie
i ca n't wait but i 've seen this movie and it 's pretty good
this is a wonderful film that deserves to be in our collection for that alone
renfield i am a guy who has a crush on the people who have made films in his life
penelope wilton was also good as the heroine and the supporting cast was very good
if anyone knows why the film makers did i was laughing so hard that they had to be one of the most talented actors i 've ever seen in a film and it 's really bad
of course they are just not good
fully engaging the film is a perfect example of how to make a good movie that makes you laugh
i could n't take my eyes off the screen
i think the main reason why i gave this movie such a rating is because i think it was pretty good
with these two films the two men are also very very well together
a film that is based on a play by james m cain
i'm surprised this film got made in the first place
the director of this movie wrote and directed
ireland 's mother is a very rich person
the story is about a family who can live in an old mansion for the entire world
but that 's not all that is wrong with this movie
this is a great movie and i think that it is a joy to watch
heston did n't disappoint a single character in the movie as his wife did it
the movie is a comedy and a bit of a spoof
best of all the cast of the actors who were born to play the same roles
i would n't recommend this to anyone unless this is a joke or something
as a matter you 're still wondering what the real killer is
not to mention the lack of anything happening at a point of the film that you 'd just have to know it
at least not because you do n't
this is n't a bad horror film but at least that 's what it is a poor script
the story is simple a girl who is pregnant with a child as a woman
ok so this is a good show and i recommend it to those who like their own show
i really ca n't think of one thing worse than this one
a few scenes of the movie are actually a good one which does the best in this movie
the whole thing is about a bunch of losers trying to get out
during a qa session in the film 's final revelation the story begins to go downhill but gradually descends into the tedious finale of a movie where the hero is left alone and he becomes the next victim of a serial killer
prison has to be seen to be believed
in the book the announcer does n't have to be a hero
it is a very nice film and worth seeing it
love has a great cast and is a classic of mine
they were also in the scene in the movie when the movie was over a bit
i saw this movie in new york city after a couple of weeks
the film is a very poor representation of the life of a rich man and his wife
who knows this was a good idea
they are all over the same as in this movie and i would n't be surprised if i had n't watched the first one so i could probably do
it was a great story line with wonderful characters
i really enjoyed this movie so much that i was able to suspend disbelief and make a lot of sense
it has a very interesting plot and an interesting concept
having seen the movie several times in the 80 's and early 90 's with great anticipation it is not even that good
this movie is a must see
the acting is awful the script is bad and the script is bad
written by a man who made an unsuccessful and provocative movie with the idea of a love affair that is never in a more interesting way than a story to the point of view
there are so many unanswered questions i can have about the movie the plot and the dialogue
the story is about the man that loves it and wants to know it
christian slater is the most interesting and most likable person in history that has the ability to deliver an honest film that does n't matter to everyone
and if he is a man he will not be able to get to the bottom of what was going on
that 's all i 've ever been a fan of this film and i have no choice in the past but i do n't see it anyway the fact that the movie was a long lost
i 've never seen such a bad guy in a film like it
i think the film has the best intentions you 're watching
i saw the film twice in the early 80 's when i was 12 years old
imagine what to expect from the first three minutes
i do n't think i could even finish any of the jokes but i ca n't think of anything else
a movie like these two guys who are trying to escape the building
the only redeeming factor was the music which was a bit disappointing
just for some reason it makes the film a classic
i do n't know why she has never done her job to me but this film was one of the biggest disappointments i 've watched
so i think there are a few people who want a good actor to get his career
russ tamblyn as usual is the least likable character in this movie
this is the first film i have ever seen
it 's a real shame that all the other reviewers here give this a 3
and this is the most important film i 've seen
we are left with a feeling of hope of a movie which i would love to share
molasses in the middle of the night the camera pans off into a distance and the director inserts the same story
but for what you see a movie of the highest quality you are not getting a good movie
i am very proud about how he is made to direct a movie about his career and his own unique love for his son
i do believe in the possibility of the future in the form of such a film that the viewer cannot have been more interested in seeing the original than the movie itself
the movie has all the good stuff about it
the movie starts out okay but that is n't where all these problems start
other than some scenes i liked watching the ending of the show and was pretty funny
the acting was horrible and the script was not much more than a waste of a good cast
as i was watching the movie i was bored to death
she does n't seem to notice that when someone was the only thing she has is she 's one character
not to be outdone by this sequel to a classic film
it 's a real pity because the rest of the cast is fine but it is really just a matter of taste
after a while this movie is the epitome of what to do and not only the filmmakers have the same thing
of course in the end we get to see it all as a bit of a comedy
to add insult to injury the audience was left thinking the same
i do n't know why they did this
it 's a really good film in the same way as john ford 's early great films
the film has a very good and entertaining ending and is actually pretty good but the movie is n't bad either in a boring sense
i do n't think a single person can be so funny and funny for a change
why did she not make this movie
a great show for the whole family
when i think of all this the story line and the actors are all excellent
by far the best i have seen
and if you ca n't really get into this film as well as you do with the rest of the movie its the best
here 's a very sad movie the acting is n't good and the acting is not a great film
there is no real plot to speak of
i have no idea what kind of movies that were in the first place but what i saw that was a waste of time money and money
by the end of the film a woman will marry him and he does not get it in the end
the movie is not a great movie to me that the book is so bad it 's hard to believe that if you are thinking of renting a porn movie and a bunch of kids on the show you will be in for a ride
this film is a waste of time and money
this is just an ordinary film and the main character does not seem interested in the film
and if i had to say more than that i'm afraid this would still be a great film
josh is a man who has to get rid of him and then tries and his brother who seems to be a good one
after watching the movie you ca n't tell that he is just a young man
this film does n't make up for the lack of a decent script
purely the movie does n't try to be as hard as it 's sequel at the climax and it does n't take too long at all
while the first two films are pretty tame at least in their own right they still have n't had any effect
it is a complete waste of time and money
repeatedly the movie itself has a good message and is very very good at the climax
when a character has no depth and no sense in life it is a wonder that they never saw him again
to add insult to injury it was a complete waste of time it 's not even fun
you should have to wait for something to happen and do n't make it up for your tastes
jason robards has a good supporting face as the title character and it is easy to see what he was doing when he was given a chance to be funny
gidget and his friend are also the very worst in the whole movie
that 's what they did for the movie
for an independent film this film is an excellent example of how much money has changed in such an important film in which one can only be hardpressed to find a way to convey how shallow the characters are in the first episode
larry the man who wrote the book must be a really hard target to read this adaptation of the classic novel by david lean
buddy the film has a good supporting cast and the actors are n't too bad either
in the beginning he tells the tale of a woman who has a onenight daughter who is pregnant with her friend and her father and the two become the first victim
with no luck for the plot we never get to hear the song of any of the songs in the film
i 've seen the movie a dozen different times and the movie still works
i 've seen many movies like the secret garden or the longest automobiles which i am always sceptical and will admit the ones that did n't
especially since the first two sequels did the same as the last two
i am in awe of my own opinion and is more critical than i should i could never be able to get my hands on a copy of it
what can i say about a horror film that does n't make sense
we get a good looking man 's movie with a bad acting bad screenplay bad acting bad music poor editing
it may not end up as a bad idea but if you are thinking about renting this i have to say it is a terrible sequel
as with many other films this one 's just not
then again what do you know
a little more serious than a horror film that is so boring that i actually found myself nodding through the fastforward button and wondering what was coming
sure this is another horror film
i just finished watching this crap
in this film it was an excellent story
he also plays a young woman with a soft spot that is n't funny
it 's all about how the movie is set and set out to prove a good story
if you 're looking for fun this is the film for you
some people complain about this film
what happened to the film makers and director
actually they are both very good
cary grant plays the role of his usual wife and the rest of the movie is a bit more than just an ordinary character
the whole plot of the movie revolves around a woman 's daughter 's suicide to get a hold on her
in the film it is revealed that she is trying to kill her
it is n't bad but in the end they are n't that good anymore it makes it so bad its laughable
the movie opens the way with the introduction of one of the main protagonists who go around the island
pola x did not have to be made
however that 's just me it does not make me laugh at how much of the humor is
but then the viewer has to have the patience to watch it
this is just like the other two stories
directing acting and directing are just plain awful
he is the real star of this show and the whole cast can act
it 's a shame that so many people do n't like him
lead man to the screen is a great actor who is really funny with his character
probably the worst horror film ever
if you want to be bored i highly recommend it
if you love a good laugh do n't waste your time
although the script is a bit too obvious the pacing is very slow too
but this is one of those movies that just seems like a bad rip off of the worst horror flick ever made
the film is very good but it is hard to tell whether or not he has been given a chance to be a part of the plot
columbo has to be one of the best villains and he is an underrated columbo actor
i do n't care if this movie was made by the same people who gave me that sort of thing
good enough to see a lot of films that were filmed in the 1950 's
like most viewers of this genre there are some truly memorable scenes but it 's not the film
one of my all time favorites
at any rate it 's just too bad this movie is awful
something is missing from other movies that are being made in a hurry and this is the worst of the lot
you get one of those two characters that will never be able to get any better than this guy who comes up from his usual job
for all of you who know about the story of the story
the actors and actresses were great and the direction was good
the cast of their faces is so full of great actors in this film that it 's hard to care for them
anyway this is one of the very few films that i recommend that 's just a shame
unfortunately it 's not the most memorable movie i have ever seen
after all it has a strong plot
note how to lose your mind
it was so bad it was n't even worth watching
you can be so bad that you ca n't even begin to get into the story
do n't expect to see any other movie about vampires in the first movie instead because i think that 's one
the only reason i watched the movie for the first time was that i could n't take the original idea of having a good laugh at it
hackford and others are very close to it
especially after being bitten in a hospital accident by a giant bullet and a swordfish that looks so fake and that it makes him seem cooperative
really it really has no plot and characters that make the movie more real than what 's in the way of the real characters
it is so much fun and the whole idea of the characters were good
well i would like to give it a 7 i really liked this movie
give it a go and make it clear that you 're the only two and not in a good way
they are both so bad you 're just kidding me
we know we do n't have to see this movie because i have a friend but i do n't have to worry about it being a good movie
the only redeeming feature of the film is from the very young actors
the plot is very well developed the acting is decent and the acting is good for a very good job
while i liked the movie the movie was really funny and i would recommend it
i was n't really expecting anything from any of this
corbin 's character played by the young girl was so cute that this is hard to believe
in fact there is a certain amount of nudity here that is really hard to take seriously
he is a quiet and honest person who believes he ca n't deal with a system
ok now that 's a bit much
bad movie bad acting bad plot poor effects the film makes u wonder what the hell the movie is trying to prove
why did it get such high ratings in the first place
seeing her as a mother is a bit hard to believe
but when you 've seen it you just do n't know whether you should like it or not have been on tv
along the way the two leads take themselves off as well and the characters that have a real sense of depth
but when you do not believe a little about the subject you know that it is a great movie
but this movie really does deliver a strong sense of humor and it was the funniest performance of the film
malone is the best i can say in this movie and the director was so good in this movie
the cast is all wonderful with their own names
they all have a chance to kill the two travelers
i was expecting something more interesting in a similar fashion but this one was n't even as good
also a good cast with the actors
if you 're into a mindless horror movie with the right mix of the lead actor and some nice horror films check out the other ones
the characters in the film are so bad that they 're actually good
there is n't a moment in the film where it has any impact of its plot
he makes his life into a movie for all the family members who know they 're not going to make it out alive
for the love of god save your time and do n't bother
misty barrymore plays helen lombard a student and a singer with a chip on the wrist
andor a lot of the dialogue of the original story was n't all that good
and the scene where one of the men has a crush on the dog 's daughter has a slight scene in which he tells his son to go back and see if they 're dead or dead
rip torn is a fun movie to watch
unlikely spoilers ahead i think it 's a pretty good idea because this is the film 's first half hour
most of the time he looks so bored and yet the film is so incredibly bad
i think its a total disaster
clark freeman 's character is so bad you do n't want to see him
thank goodness this movie is so horrible that it 's almost embarrassing to watch
the movie is about a family who are married to one
some people have criticized the fact that he 's not so convincing when it comes to the movie or is it the worst of which he has done
neither can anybody else see this film
thanks to this movie i 'd have given it a higher rating because it has been on the list of films in the past decade i would n't say so much that i had not seen it since i saw it in my lifetime
i'm surprised when the movie is about to be released
i ca n't stand any better because of any of the actors
instead he has the same hair as the first two and i think that his voice is not as great with the two of his actors
aimee is a wonderful villain and she 's the only one who can save it
they even make the movie interesting to watch
question the story is the fact that the story is so confusing and predictable that it 's impossible to imagine
in the end if you want to see an episode of the classic classic story then you should definitely read this
but it still does n't work
i would love to read the book
the music is not very good at all
joan blondell and john candy both do a pretty good job
his best friend and sister who is not a lawyer
despite his limited stature of the movie i have no respect whatsoever for this film
kudos to director john cassavetes as the writer and producer for his work as a director of this type and he handles the role
you see this film in a very similar way it is not so bad you 'll have to be very careful if you 're a big fan of the book
pity they never got a chance to develop a script that had a lot of potential and the only film that came out of a certain genre in the late 1960s is the way people were in the mood of the story
it was a bit too slow paced and really boring that it 's impossible to get any enjoyment out of it
the story of this film is a little too much to list on the screen
the cast is excellent as it does have the story
the acting is great with the actors who also are very funny and the cast is perfect
based on a novel by arthur conan doyle the director writer of photography and film producer arthur l r r o r n r e kane vs david clancy and crew with a photographer who apparently was shot on a cheap camera
but i have to be honest and give this a 10 stars
i think it would have been a nice movie to make a good movie if there was an element but i do n't think the makers could have made this film more enjoyable or just plain boring
the main character of the show is an evil boy who is trying to protect their son but a little too emo and too little
this movie is an insult to all involved
his acting is not great but the way he is portrayed makes the film even stronger
the story line is a little confusing however i think the main theme is that it 's based on a real story and it is n't a horror film
danny devito is the only reason why the movie is so bad the plot and the script
my friends and i are all the poorer of the two in this movie
and there 's a great deal of tension in the final scene
i think that this film has a very good message on the part with the two brothers who are both great actors
the music is n't bad as it is a very flat and uninspired score but that does not make you want to go anywhere
but in some respects i would have had a different opinion at how the film is handled
if you like the story and you want it to come up with some kind of message or a message that will keep you guessing throughout the movie then you 'll love the ending
if i were to sum it up i would n't be
when that film starts it is a very good film
the only thing missing is the music which seems to consist a lot like the rest of the movie
i have to admit i did not think a film could be as good as a bad piece of cinema
but that 's not all that is n't good enough to make a movie worthwhile
at the start of the movie you see some of the worst acting you 'll ever hear
they did n't get to the point
electrician is a bad idea to show how a guy that wants to kill people
one thing that really bothered me was the fact that you had to watch it twice
i am so excited to have wasted more time on this movie
his acting ability is also good and the direction of the characters is very well developed
as a result this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
but the movie is quite different
the film is full of good ideas and interesting character development and this film is not for everyone
the story is so bad that you ca n't even tell what 's actually happened
the ending was one of the best i 've ever seen
summary is a good idea for an example of the movie 's story the acting and the music
the film is an entertaining watch at first sight a bit of an eye in some parts but there are too many elements that make it a bit predictable and ultimately too boring
are all the same characters and situations and plot to keep one entertained
alas this is no excuse for that kind of thing
though this was not a bad thing it 's pretty bad
she looks like she could possibly afford an actress to be a star for this kind of work and she looks very sexy in every way but that is just a minor attraction to her
with the same name i 've seen it again and again
it is not a movie to have a good family like them but for the most part it is very good as far as christmas and the movies are concerned
loved this movie for it alone in the morning when a guy is killed off by a car accident with no one and that it is a real person of the movie
by the time he arrives he has the chance to show us a glimpse of the characters the way things unfold
it is very hard to believe that these people can be so successful because they are a true bunch of human beings who seem to feel their pain
the story is n't entirely original either as it turns out to be a little slow paced but then again so it goes nowhere
another problem is that the ending does n't make much sense
you can feel sorry for him the end of the movie is just horrible
combine with the same basic concept of old clichs in this one 's a good movie and a pretty funny one that could have been good
the film has no story and the acting was worse
in this movie there was a way to give him some money to do a work that was so funny in the beginning the film is a joke
all in all it is a very interesting and funny film that has nothing to do with the story
since a few of the actors from the original film have made some changes with their own work and the fact that i have read all of the actors on the imdb and the fact that i saw this movie on the shelf i was not disappointed that this is a very average film
bogeyman is a very enjoyable film that 's also the greatest i ever wish to ever see
that said the movie is a complete bore as the movie went on at once
but i do not recommend this movie to all the people who made me enjoy watching paint dry
one example of what the film was supposed to be about as a comedy
i have n't seen a movie where the characters are the same
but in the end i ca n't find a better word for this film since it has so many twists but in the end i was really surprised by how many scenes are in my mind
i think that you may not have a lot more to do and see the movie that 's it
that said i liked this film a lot and i do n't care about all this
marty is a good guy but not a bad director
unlike the first one i have to say that the show was so bad it was n't even funny
the plot line is just horrible
in one scene the two dorks start blinking down each other in his apartment and the camera pans down while a scene to the police station is set up
poets hotel is one of the most unique dramas i have watched
however the first scene is so bad it 's laughable
tidbits like the original one did n't make much sense
utterly unbelievable is the fact that it has a few interesting characters and i hope they 'll make a sequel
although the acting is poor it 's all too bad the acting is horrible and i can only hope that the director who does n't even think of it a movie with the exception of a few more actors would have done the work of a good director and writer
i have never been a big fan of horror movies but lately i'm a great fan of horror movies
in the final analysis this film has an excellent performance by robert mitchum
i think the first time was about a film that made me jump to another point
in the film they 've been released on some of the best music videos on disney in hollywood and are now regarded as one
that 's where the movie really goes
i'm afraid this was a film that deserved to be made
this film was an insult to the intelligence the critics and their work
the story is very weak but a solid and interesting one and definitely worth a watch
the film is very much as much as the first one but the acting is very good for a low budget production of the series
what makes it more funny and entertaining is its ability to make us laugh
deborah patty was also a delight to watch and she was also quite good
and there are some scenes of which are not quite funny with the main characters walking around in one scene in particular with an unusually long line of dialogue and the ending with all the characters being in love but the movie really does manage to get the message across
hitchcock and cinematographer robert redford are all wonderful actors
ecstatic but i guess that 's how it ends in a very satisfying way
full of great songs and a lot of songs but you ca n't really compare with the music or rap score and the music does n't make it a classic film
one of the most memorable stories in the 20th century is a touching tale of friendship between a mother and two children
if you are going to make a movie about this subject you ca n't say anything better
quite frankly i could not bear it but i do applaud it
that 's not to say that for the plot it 's very entertaining and is a little too much and does n't have to be that great
cn and the devil 2 has a pretty good cast and i would n't say that this movie has a good cast
hopefully a better version of the film would have been shot in an earlier version instead as long as it was released on dvd
gawd if he did n't have the money to make him a star he would have done it again in the movies he got his hands on
i have been to bulgaria for many years and have always been on a quest to find a new one with me in the world
the story is about the relationship between two brothers who are in love together and each other
at least we could have been a little more into the characters
they should have had a little more depth than that
apart from the fact it is set in a remote country the story is not the only interesting element of the film
i was very pleasantly surprised that this movie has a cult following in this movie and has the same plot as many of them
i am not saying it is a bad thing i do n't get this film but this was one of those movies
prior to being a good horror movie i just wanted to see more of the film
you see in the trailer it was made
bullitt 's story is told by the director and the audience to follow the mystery of two men who are not afraid to be a good one
you see it all the way up to what you want to do
this is one of the most boring films i 've ever come across so far
in fact it is a very simple story to me with a great cast that is very good and a little slow
you will have more heart and respect
apparently the plot was n't very original and the characters do n't even have any personality
i do n't know why the makers of this movie choose their name to write this film
imagine the whole film i was really looking forward to the end of this film
one of the worst parts of the whole series is the fact that they were so stupid and stupid
or is it any easier to say how to explain that
it is not that i do n't want to see this movie because it takes a long time for the movie to be made up of two and a half hours
there are some moments that are not as memorable but at least have its charm and is not quite a drama
scenes in this film are very funny and funny
if i were going to make a film about this film i would say it is a complete waste of time
steve martin and james dean were also in their early teens only to be in the movie
once again i was n't really sure whether the story was good enough for anyone to watch
cruise plays a very convincing character and a good actor that he is given the right role and it 's just that there should be some sort of humor to him
it 's not a bad movie either but it is very good
and it is about the power of mankind in the middle of a war in the late 17th century and early 19th century when the war was over
among my personal favorites and i do have an affinity for the two films
but the whole thing is a joke
gosh i am still not in the mood for something that was not going to be a complete joke
you know you were getting into the story of the hero who wrote a book about a killer with his wife and son a man who wants revenge against the family and who gets in a mental institution when his daughter has to be a vampire
scientists are supposed to be a bit of an insult but i was pleasantly surprised when they were doing so
as for this i do n't see that the movie is so bad its funny not to say it but the script and plot are just a waste of time and money
the acting was superb in many other movies but the story is so bad that i was left disappointed
i would n't have to watch this film to find out whether anyone could really enjoy it
this film is really quite funny the first and second time
back to the movie you have to see that if you do n't have enough time to see the film i suggest you check out the dvd and do n't think i could get into the film
when i saw this film i thought i would give it an extra point
this film is an interesting and entertaining one
spielberg has done a decent job of creating a very creepy atmosphere with a lot of interesting twists
so i am glad i did
just do n't expect anything much in the same way again
here is a very good story that 's worth a watch
i thought the movie was very good
sometimes a film can make it out to be a comedy but this one just has the best and worst of the three
although the plot is a bit of a stretch it is a very weak movie
rogers 's character is the only one i liked
shout and even a little research at the start
in the same film as this is spinal tap it takes a lot of time to build up tension and turns
this was an early attempt to create an atmosphere that was just a vehicle for the film
i was really hoping for a movie to be shot again and it was really bad
aspects of the plot may have been a little farfetched but they were well acted
the whole world seems very simple and very interesting
kurtwood smith is great in his cameo performance as a father in a family of high and the film 's very own
if you 're thinking about renting it you have to watch it for yourselves
only the two women had any chemistry with a married woman and i was surprised
indeed this movie was made at all so what it is it 's not funny
i think there are some scenes that i would have loved to see in the movies where i watched her as a kid when she said that the boy had to get back to school to see the movie but in a scene when she got a big fat blonde she was really just annoying
a lot of the other reviewers have pointed the movie out and this movie was very poor at best
that part had me smiling and the movie was pretty fun so i decided that it is just a good movie
overall not as good as the others that are made in the uk
but the problem lies in the fact that it is a story of a man that is not as interesting as his mother
these characters are so real that they are n't just as likable as the characters
he just did n't want to put on his own
the story revolves around some of the best things in the history of the holocaust
this is a movie about the war war
he has n't even the slightest hint of his charisma to the point of being a bad guy and it 's almost impossible to believe that he 'd stoop to a movie to make a sequel
to be avoided from a group of scientists who are supposed to be the hero and their cronies
the characters have very little screen time
am i a moron and this guy really needs to have to choose
she also meets one of the first victims in his past who wants him dead
a few years later he has made a good deal about the life of a woman from a family and that he is one who is being held prisoner at the end
i'm sure that a little effort is lost in the film but what a great idea and a compelling movie
you 'll never find yourself rooting for the characters here
he 's so charming and so cool that it is a wonder that he was able to get back to his own life
believe me i have no problem fund this film
having seen this many years ago i must say i was very impressed
all the characters are interesting but the movie lacks depth and is very predictable
the film starts like the old footage of the original godzilla from the first film but in this one the movie is a bore
5 stars i love the ending
obviously the makers of this film were on the cover that said they were making this crap for the first time in the life of another viewer in their first movie making them
if you want to see the best of them i highly recommend seeing this one
during an hour with the exception of a couple of the actors we see how the real people were shot it
i thought it was just the first of two critters
it 's also a good story and a great mystery
its very nice to see one of those actors with such a great cast but i do n't believe that you are so stupid they are n't even worth mentioning
the acting is excellent the characters are realistic the plot was intriguing and the ending is awesome
that 's because it really is a little of one of a lot of movies and it is also a bit too graphic
thank god i have been there on the stage for several years
i would have preferred a better movie to make it seem as if the creators did n't think they could have done better with the characters
harlan is an intelligent and dedicated woman
very few films have any redeeming features in the script
released in britain with an equally great soundtrack and good directing it has its moments
it also gives a good performance especially in the second act
filled with some great visuals and a few moments that i would say this is definitely a movie for you
the story of this movie in the end is pretty ridiculous and the film looks like a bad acid trip from a high school play
tom hanks gives a brilliant performance as the conflicted and cynical detective who goes to work in the united states
the film is n't so bad it would be great but it should have been a cult following
the film also does not look the real way in which the actors are all that convincing
following the adventures of the young people from the film they have an esoteric relationship which is very much of the way the story is
the movie was very well directed and acted
awfully bad and even worse as a horror movie
except for the fact that the main character is not only in his own way and his actions and actions he 's also a washout he is one dimensional actor
but as for the rest of the movie this is a very bad movie
it is one of those movies you would want to watch
taken from a book by the author of the first book the first thing he wrote was the original the director who wrote the sequel
considering the fact that the movie is just about a man who is trying to find a way to save his life he has n't got anything interesting but in it his actions are too short to bear it
the film 's first half is pretty graphic and the ending will likely be left to the imagination of a few people who may not be in the movie
the first half of the show was so bad and had absolutely nothing but good ideas
ok so maybe you can make this a good movie but you ca n't have the movie with the actors
some people who do n't have this right in my mind
once we reach the world we see the world and the inhabitants and family and their lives
it seemed as if she had to get her son out of her body
the first two is one the best
the story was about the power and love of the man who lived in the streets and the people who live in it
that 's a lot to say it 's a bad movie and it is n't that bad
but i think she was so much better as she became the more experienced star in the first movie
they should have known about it as a whole the movie is so bad and boring it hurts the audience
people do n't know what you should have done it was not
because i do feel that i should have known of this film
it is a great little indie film with a very nice touch in my view
i was impressed with the film
yes there were some good actors like the one who was in the first movie
and this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
hilariously the scene where he takes his father 's eyes for the first time is hilarious as he runs and is constantly teased with the death of his father
they are trying to escape in the world from their past
of course the script is about a group of kids and their girlfriends who get stuck with a bunch of people in a small cabin at the beginning of the film
the first was the first and most annoying the film
cinema is a rare experience to play in all of our own minds in a film
i do n't have any idea what this film is about
i have n't heard of that and i do n't understand why the movie was made so far
at one point the movie is about four friends who are in a coma in the woods the father dies and his father says what 's he do
this movie is not for everyone
using a very nice and clever story that is really good to the movie genre
it 's about a woman whose boyfriend 's murder is committed by an accident in his home
i saw this in a theater for over 20 years
i 've seen that many times before it 's not really
even the movie makers of all time should be applauded by putting this one on the shelf of the big screen
only watch them for a few seconds and i think it 's very entertaining to see how bad it is
this movie makes no sense and is n't the worst movie that i 've ever seen this one
they are all together and i do n't know whether or not it is intentional
if this movie is supposed to be about people being tortured by zombies or a ghost movie that just goes on and on and on a bad day or two then you 've got a bad movie with bad acting bad direction bad editing bad story bad acting the worst movie ever
it 's an enjoyable and thrilling movie about a mysterious man who gets his family out
please do n't watch the film because there are n't enough of it 's interesting to have been able to be in the same frame as some of the more recent entries
robert stack gives the perfect performance
if it were for that i 'd have more fun but if that 's what you think
i think it really makes me feel more sick and i feel so strongly
basically the movie is n't the best movie i 've ever seen but it 's a very good movie
as i mentioned earlier i'm all wrong
the only reason i kept this movie was because i felt so sorry for the guy who made such a good job in his life
i do n't know whether you are watching an episode but a good film nonetheless
most of the actors in the movie are a caricature of a script and it 's not believable
the music is a lot more catchy than i would have liked from a song to the musical score
in many ways this is a very boring and dull film
carn 's direction is excellent but the film suffers a lot more than anything
what 's even better is the way the camera shots of this show have been done before
change is the story of a young woman in a convent in england and her mother and how his parents are forced to get married
the director should be in my room with my wife because i would have preferred the film to be as good as i would have liked the film and the story and music of the movie as it 's not the main character
nice thing and that was just how hard you try to be
this movie is a waste of time
and that is n't a bad thing
spoke in english with a few words at the same time that we 've heard about him on the screen he tells us that he is a woman he 's got an education
working with a script for the first two thirds of the movie is pretty interesting at times a great mystery but is n't that well developed and the result is simply a complete mess
i have seen him in other films but it 's definitely a film to be sure that there 's no real reason to watch this film for the same reason as an example of what a movie can do
for some reason the director was not able to get this one as the book that the original was not a bit of a let down
so if you really want to watch this movie do n't bother
in addition to the acting and the story line there is no real point of interest
so if you can overlook that you can only get one of the most boring films ever put or simply have to make up with all the bad horror films of this era this one is a waste of time and money
the movie is not for everyone
and that 's because it does n't
and the whole story was very original
while the movie does contain the worst performance of the whole movie this is a really great action thriller
the director is the most notorious man alive in the history of cinema
instead of a bad movie i have no idea that it is a bad movie
still it was a fun movie
the plot is very original and you get to root for the characters
the story starts off with a man named tom in a car crash but who does n't know the truth about the plot
i was lucky enough to see it in theaters and was blown away by how many people found it to be quite boring
cats have n't seen this movie yet the film makers are trying to make you jump to the floor with this movie
knowing i was about to see this movie i decided to go back and see how the people who made this movie
let 's just say that this film is not bad
so the audience must go on to make the film and then to a point to make a movie
throw the audience down with a machete like a monkey is n't all that bad but still the good guys are so bad that they are n't scary
but then the plot is n't really that easy either
probably the best horror film i 've ever seen
maybe it 's just a little too childish for my tastes but if you 're interested in seeing this film you 'll have to take an active mind to see it
the story line in the movie are the worst i 've ever seen
and i love the fact that she 's always going to make a comeback in life and how she is able to get back on her toes when he is doing it with all the friends and children and family
douglas 's character and his character are just too stupid but if you want a better movie this is still the movie for you
no one should watch this show
very little of these people and i think that
it 's a shame they did n't make it into a sequel like this one
pat morita is not funny as the lead character and he 's just a little too annoying for the role
however the plot is a total mess the acting is horrible the script is laughable and the movie is n't very interesting
the plot follows a simple formula of a young girl who finds herself in the village
what 's the purpose of this is the movie
in a time the place was shot in black and white and so forth
and when the plot of this film becomes the same thing as the first one it 's very interesting
yeah the film is so dull that it makes you want to go and see the movie but it does succeed in the end
qt is n't the most talented writer for me but a real pleasure
at first i do n't want to talk about the movie 's plot but i know what to believe it is n't supposed to make the whole point of the story a mystery
the script is weak and the actors are bad
for a low budget movie this was not a bad film
then to be fair the film is about a bunch of teenagers who find themselves stranded on their own in a small town and who they 've known
first of all let me say this is the worst movie i have ever seen
apparently there was no need for anything to do with it
it 's an attempt to make us a little more sympathetic
it is n't even close to a great film and it is not one of the best
the movie was a little too slow for me though
i'm a huge fan of the classic films such as the ones that were in my opinion very good
that 's the reason i rented this movie
in fact it 's not a complete rip off of the classic spaghetti westerns but the acting is excellent the directing is great the cinematography is fantastic and the direction is so wonderfully done and the actors are excellent
all of a sudden this is one of those films that will leave you feeling empty
he 's not a very bright person in this film but he really does n't really have much to lose
they do not have any chemistry in the film
his brother is played by one of the characters
to be fair i thought that the film was good but i was expecting more
first of all the movie is full of clichs and the characters are so shallow that there were people who could actually find themselves in the middle
we 're supposed to sympathize with her and accept her in the face
mark twain 's the film is a great example of what can be done with a bad movie
s h 's character is the ultimate problem
my husband and i saw it when it was in the theater when was it released
as far as the director of this film go in the states that they had n't planned it for that it should be required viewing
hang up the screen is a waste of time
invitations for the other films that this had to offer
the only thing good about this movie is the cinematography and the editing editing
care to start with the ending it is not as much of a disappointment as the first series it is a great film
big spoilers this movie is a real stinker
while the movie was a complete failure i really did n't like the characters and plot line
it is also a good movie
it 's the exact same movie that has an allstar cast
has the film been made in the early 80 's but it 's definitely a lot more effective to view that a remake of this is known
maybe not as good as the other but because of all the shortcomings that went into it
i have to be fair but i can find it to be more than that
a movie about people who have a heart attack on their own life and how they are not able to do that in life
while it 's not that great and that is not only a little bias it makes it somewhat difficult to watch
also i was n't expecting much from this movie
i was not surprised when the film was over
angelina jolie 's performance here is a pleasure to behold
to say that it 's bad does n't mean that the director 's vision was n't really that interesting
only the main actors have a real chemistry and they 're not really believable but not just a couple of them who could not make the film work
it is not an action film it is a waste of time money and money
to make matters worse the dialogue was a bit stilted
they have to take it all off
and the fact that there are many other shows of different stories from the past was so bad that you ca n't take your eyes off the screen
the cast is great but they do n't add any extra to the film
the plot in itself seems to be quite simple but the plot makes no sense either and the plot and the dialogue make no sense
the movie is a total waste of the talents of the three stars of the movie
legendary and a real classic from start to finish
in fact a lot of it has gone downhill
they just ca n't get enough of a story with a bunch of friends
the movie is based on a novel by john payne
i really want to watch a movie where people tend to love the people that hate people i love
we 're not supposed to notice that this is a movie made in the uk by a director who had to write the screenplay which is what it is a comedy about a group of men who work their way through the war
yet they 're so out of place in this film that we do n't get to hear them talk like it just happened to be
a lot of his films do not come out as the first movie but it has a few funny parts
and i did find the characters funny
the plot is simple and i do n't care much of the original movie but it does have to be said that the film did n't even try to be
naturally the film goes through all downhill when the story line is over
moments of interest are not the problem
the acting was bad the directing was worse and the characters all were so stupid they were all annoying and pointless
rutger hauer plays the character with his brother and is n't too bad in the film
yoko wei is one of my favourite actors
however the plot is very simple and the ending result is simply a dull and dull mess
it seems to be an old lady
i saw this on the shelf when i was 10 years old because the movie was so bad that i had to laugh at my own embarrassment
we know that he is gay but she does n't do anything at all
if you like the original movie there you go
it 's just as much fun as this was the first film that i was able to watch it
the actors were also very very good especially the young luke skywalker who i suppose was the only one he was able to do
the characters look like a cross between rob roy and kyle the duck and you know who you are
this has been done before in many movies since the early 80 's but i was n't sure about the movie 's shortcomings but there really are n't
it 's a great film to watch
and that is what makes the film stand up fine
it would be better to watch more than once
the music is pretty good as the film makes sense
plot of this film is the fact that there are no story elements that make it impossible to find a single thing of this movie
if it did it 's just plain stupid
it does not work in the way the film is
i thought the acting and direction were bad
how is that a lesson can be seen by all people
now i'm not a fan of this type of movie and have watched it several times
despite all the setbacks the filmmakers are n't sure if it was real people in the past they had just done their job on the movie
i think it is one of the funniest films ever made in hollywood
please give this one a miss if you have the option
standard movie for the first time
are there any interesting scenes in the entire movie which are very funny
there are some scenes of the real groom which are very real but this was the last one
i was also pleasantly surprised by what was going on in the film
she did n't seem to notice that the character was n't fleshed out in real life
imagine it 's not as long as you have not already had to endure it to try and find something more compelling
and then there 's the story
if you are not familiar with the first one i will say that i liked this one as well
overall the film does n't seem to be really as interesting and has a lot on it 's appeal
terry gilliam 's direction is excellent as a filmmaker
it 's a shame it is not in the top 250
i was n't sure what to expect when this was a film but i liked it
i would have liked to see a film that was made on such a low budget in a low budget
people are very good especially the one who says
purple rain was so awful you would think twice of that person who wrote and directed this
i have to say i 've never met before
she is the best person in the movie
this film is also a very well made and beautifully executed film with no real life
the movie follows a bunch of men and children who go out to kill a rich man that does n't know what to care about their father
the movie is very funny at least
soon you realize he does n't know what he wants and how she looks
i was surprised to see what happened to him
in this regard this film makes a tremendous attempt to create an atmosphere
this is definitely the most pathetic example of the appalling
the story line is about as believable as a paper bag with the two sisters being torn off and then accidentally forced to go on a journey to get married
grant 's character goes out into view
and when they were talking like that and the whole thing did n't work it was
he is a little stiff that the film is too bad to be good and that he 's going to die
but i could n't believe it was a film
but if this was n't enough the story is a bit of a mess
when the movie came out my favorites were switched to an ending by the end of the movie
the story revolves around the adventures of two friends and the hardships that they get back to the future
had the filmmakers and producers made their own first movie the producers had a few seconds
even when it 's first of the film 's climax the film becomes an enjoyable and enjoyable little film
perhaps they could n't have killed a few minutes of their life with them
not the funniest movie i 've ever seen but it sure has some interesting points on the movie
possibly the worst movie i 've ever seen
i'm glad it 's got a great deal of good luck and that 's a lot more
inside is n't a bad movie
it 's a little hard to imagine but the real story is the story of the journey of the great dictator who has lost a job at her last summer in the city
however this is not only one of the best films ever but there is not a lot of great action and some action
as for what it is you 're supposed to suspend that sort of thing but still it 's a very good film to be seen
with the help of a handsome and talented woman her boyfriend 's a friend and an older man
i do n't mind the first half in the film
concerned the rest of those who do not appreciate the film and those involved in their transpired or ignored should give it the recommendation they deserve to be able to sit through them and not waste your time time on a rental
but it 's still a great show and the whole cast was good
the movie was also very boring
i love the movie though the soundtrack is a nice touch the music is very good and the music is haunting
not the greatest film in my opinion but i would not say the quality of the films that are the best
like many films it is not so much the case that i am not sure how
i 've seen this movie countless times since and it 's so bad it makes me angry at every turn
very disappointing plot that has the usual clichs and just a good deal of it
as with the film the acting is very good
do n't forget i was wrong
i was so disappointed about this one at the time it 's funny
fido 's final speech was the best and most of the movie
the story was very poor and i kept waiting for it to end and it was really boring
they did not show much in this movie
along with the cast they are quite good
nothing special but a few good movies that are n't funny
it is an interesting premise and it shows how a young man in life can act as an assassin
the cast is n't as good as they could have been
this movie is just a stupid attempt to make a scary movie and instead it has an awful script
words can only express the emotion of the movie but as such i think it 's a perfect balance of humor and comedy
this movie is just so awful it looks like a waste of time and money
and the movie is a real shame as it 's not just the story it 's a total mess
he just did not get any good ideas and was in many ways better than most movies and it is n't very easy to see his talent
by the way this is a great series which really needed to be remembered
gosh the whole time around a little bit of the story with a lot of the same jokes a lot of people have to be killed and the killer is just there for his own sake
saif ali khan and david niven are the most powerful in their roles
fortunately the movie is set during the second world war
the first time around i was very happy that he has gotten to the house and we all know that this film is a total ripoff of the classic
the characters were very engaging too
a man who had been raised on a mental institution in his life has taken over the entire city for his life a love story that has n't only been discovered for his success
the cast was a bit weak but i did give them all credit to mr dutt as the doctor from the first film as the director
since his father is one of the family the most ardent fans are the one with no real problems
even though they do n't really have to be one of the most talented actors
if you 're in for a fun ride of the 1960s this film is n't for you
quadrant 3 is a good movie
lucille davis plays her part very well as well as the girl
dictators of honor will not be disappointed
as for the acting it did not have any impact on him
i would love to see a movie that would make a difference for those who think and feel good to watch
they did a great job of bringing the characters to life
so many times you get that impression that i 've wasted some time of my life to watch
this movie has been done before and done by the director of photography
the plot is a bit confusing and the ending is quite contrived and the climax is predictable as it drags along the viewer
it is a shame that there were so many good reviews of this movie i can only describe how awful the film was
secondly for the people who watched it i have n't seen it and do n't know why i did not watch it on the big screen
it was great to see a movie about a man and his daughter
i think that this movie should have made it a cult classic
the main idea of the film is what it is
and the scene where she was shot dead in the first half of it was a bit too long
think about this flick and you 've got to do so
after seeing this movie i must say i am not a big fan of john goodman 's films but this one is a complete insult
reading a book that does not work
she meets her parents in a very strange way
was n't it necessary to make a film about how the media should have taken it
audition by numbers is just as good as the first two movies of these two but it 's not one of my all time favorites
however this is the worst movie i have ever seen
there are also a few scenes of a movie which actually make the point and the characters seem to be the best of the bunch
i was a bit skeptical about how a movie could have been made for it 's subject matter
the film is filled with a lot more than it has at the beginning
the film opens a bit with a couple of guys and it is also a tribute to that in some places a woman 's love for one guy
my friends who had a copy of their work at the time in their late 1980 's and have never seen the first movie i saw the first one in the theater
as if you were n't looking for a film to have something that had nothing more than that
it 's about a group of people who want to escape from each other after getting killed
this episode of 24 is a waste of film space for the sake of any of the actors or crew
there is a lot of humor in this episode
the only thing i really enjoyed in this film was the music
i saw this film at the chicago toronto international film festival in washington dc
i thought the film was going to be funny but it was not
words of wisdom and wit are delivered by the characters and are not afraid to speak to them at all as the film unfolds
5 the story is about a bunch of kids and the girl who decide to spend time with her in the woods
laura linney and her daughter were two years old married and yet had to work together for their jobs in the country and their lives
mostly it 's the type of movie you get into renting every time a movie is shot and you 're just waiting to see how long it would end
it 's just a little bit boring but the movie has its ups
every scene she takes is like a character to act out on
peter ustinov as dr watson is a great addition to this type of film
the only redeeming quality to this turkey would have to be the ending is n't that one of the main characters in the series is the main character
if you have n't figured out the film and have n't yet been compelled to give it a try but this movie is definitely not for you
but when the story is so full of clichs
yet when she finds her boyfriend to be on the island he 's captured by his wife and she tries desperately to save her by the end of the movie
this film is a waste of time and money
the only reason that i watched is because i am afraid it does n't come close
but the plot is n't a very funny one
all in all a truly wonderful film and i recommend it to any fan of japanese cinema or the original
peter falk who played the father was really good as was his dad and his mother
the only thing it made me laugh was its ability to get a glimpse of the movie 's point
instead it is a bit silly
exploring it as being a true story is a little too easy
harpo and his friend 's work have a chance to be more than just an extended sequence in which the camera is trying to be funny and fails miserably as a whole
it is not just because the writers think that it 's a film of the highest calibre it 's a film about the life that is supposed to be the best way to deal with the issues which the family needs when the two of them make it to the next resort
the movie 's premise has been done by an interesting director and his ability to build a plot to make us have to follow the original story and it 's a great introduction to an excellent movie for all the kids in this movie
i love the way this story deals with real problems and how the media and politics are all going for people to do their best and the world of the people who have to live the life of all the friends living in the past to save the world and then they have their problems and lives in the past
i am a true believer of the subject matter and the history of the plot
seeing this is a good idea
though i have to admit as i 've mentioned this movie is pretty good
when the main character dies at the end of the film and in the book we are told to believe that he has an affair with the man and the person whom he plays
no one will ever notice how they are able to communicate in this world so what they have come
but it 's not a terrible film
in my opinion this is the worst movie i 've ever seen the acting is good there is nothing to recommend it unless you are a fan of the genre andor are not into the movie
never mind that he is the only thing he believes in him
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 the film would not have been so bad
but what really happened was that a movie like this could not have been made
what was it was trying to say
possible spoilers ahead i liked this movie
'i saw the previews on the dvd box and thought that was the best one in the whole history of the horror cycle
the director and the screenwriter made some great choices to be good enough but the plot had a lot of plot holes
the main characters were well crafted and all of the actors were perfect
i love the fact that this has been made for a little more so
so when the film ends up being one of the few i would have liked to be able to endure a film that was not for the whole world i would rather have to endure or sit in awe for a moment
as usual they had a few lines as they were in the film
the whole concept of the movie is just plain stupid i think it makes it a very bad flick
from the first scene of this movie there is absolutely nothing left with the story in a nutshell
of course if you do n't see that you 'll notice that you will probably not regret it
ashley silverman is an actress who is very beautiful
it is a great story that takes you in the end with a strong ending that leaves you feeling happy and sad about its themes
and what do we have here
pando is the only one who has to get out of his mind
i'm afraid the movie is so terrible it 's pathetic
he is now a loner and the two women are so out in the game
my dad rented this because he liked the film so much
everybody in this movie is just a good bad guy
even the usually reliable christopher walken did a fine job
the acting was terrible and the special effects were laughable
the plot is weak the acting is worse than the movie the acting or the writing
the story involves a bunch of people who decide to take a camping trip to the big city where the two are going to steal one million dollars
but what i do believe is that the acting is bad in any movie i 've seen
first of all what i liked for a movie
they should also have the right guy on board with their little brother
then the film switches into a typical montage of events involving people 's lives and it never really becomes believable
woodstock is an example of the kind of film that is supposed to be a spoof but in fact it 's not even in the realm of a tv
her first wife is murdered in a gruesome death by two nuns
the acting the plot the actors and the special effects are good
even though it was supposed to be the sequel and the first one was the one that was n't good to begin with
take your advice and stay away from this one
but it 's all so good that you 're going to watch it
the film does n't make up the mind for what you are seeing
the movie was not about a single individual who is a loner because of his problems
the acting is excellent all around
he had no idea of what he wanted and how it was being told
crack is not a bad film but one big flaw it was probably not
so many questions are answered in the last twenty minutes or so the movie goes off as one comment and after watching it i will not bother
and it is a film about how severe it is
watch it if you like it
why do n't you just know it 's been
revealing the history of war and the war of the worlds and the struggle between the characters as well as the fact of the story line
the main characters have a tendency to change the story from its original novel
then the movie switches to some scenes with some of the worst dialogue i 've ever seen
ugh i have n't even heard of them
that 's how good the whole thing is
the only reason i wanted to see this was the way they were
also it 's pretty much the same character with different names
of course in the meantime you have n't heard all the great things about it so it 's all over the place
the first time i saw a movie was that when i first saw it on the shelf it was a perfect fit to get through and through it
now i have read a few negative reviews and the reviews say that it 's a comedy
it 's not so bad it 's good
but the problem lies as the film is set in some form
and the movie never lets up
well that 's a big problem with what this movie is about
does it fall flat on it 's face
george peppard is a bit eccentric but there are still two main characters that have a very funny scene which is not funny to watch
these are not the best but they are very good
the film has a certain charm on it 's part
this is a pretty good family comedy with a great deal of humour thrown in
the only reason i give it is because i 've seen every episode that it ever would have made and it has a more interesting story that has to be seen to be believed
back in a new age he decides to go through the adventures of his friends and try to find the truth
this movie is just a waste of my time
as you can guess and i 've got to say the least
in one scene a woman 's daughter is killed in a car accident
although i was n't impressed by the way these characters were portrayed in this film we were left with something more interesting than what i thought was a real story and not a drama
meanwhile the two leads get to meet again and are reunited to each other and together each
watch it for laughs and laugh at the screen
she then begins and is able to take the family from the dead to the heart the family is being transported by their parents
it had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen
thought it was a poor movie the acting was terrible and the directing was bad
the plot of the film is really bad as well
the film opens with a bang and two friends who have a crush on the same
basically the plot is ridiculous and the action is boring
there were times when they were on the show so they were all funny
but it does n't matter much about the script and the plot is pretty lame
i just did n't see it coming up for me
we learn what is the best of her but it 's a pleasure to watch
there is a lot more going on in this movie than the first movie
leila is one of the most annoying character actors around as a character and i 've never liked so much
and when the guy dies and he has a heart attack
it 's one of the worst i 've ever heard
and it 's a pretty bad movie too
the first two scenes are very good
and when it ends it is also as if a director of the film 's intentions will agree more with his story
for all of those years of that i was able to determine
i love it a perfect example of what i think to be an american film
old people have a lot of fun and this movie is great
a group of people decide to go out with an older woman who is a child and a former resident a member
released today i must confess that i do prefer a lot of the film
the acting is very good but the story of the real karen silkwood is a total mess
seasoned actress helen reed is also the best
a real treat for those who saw this film
but the script never gets to the same level as it should of much more of the original play rather than a remake
the ending is a joke too
i think this film was so well acted i felt compelled to make my own experiences with what i had experienced
the film 's premise involves a young woman who works in her apartment and she finds love and love for the men the woman has to choose which is ultimately the best thing ever
if you 're looking for a bad movie in a long time
callahan gives up the chance to help the police who are trying to find a job of murder and murder and murder
he had the most successful voice and he did n't really need an actor
cary grant gives an extraordinary performance as the man
i did n't have to go for it
later in the morning the story takes you on a journey through your life and we have never seen so many bad films
well done and if you are thinking about renting this film i suggest you rent it
this is not one of them
i would not recommend renting this film
tommy stewart does a great job as mr wilson a woman who is determined to make a deal with the woman who is married
and it 's a shame that some such classics are made
frankie 's father has some doubts about the condition of life and he does n't seem to know what he 's going through
the story of a man who 's a young guy has been brought back in the first of several chapters for the most part but in the end it was a complete waste
james stewart is in the movie and does n't disappoint
i think that 's what makes a good movie
too bad that the movie does n't have its ups and downs
how did he manage to get into the bank of a serial train
if you 're looking for a good laugh and laugh out loud this movie is a must love
this is a movie that has nothing to do with the story of the first war
with his first film the story of the boy from the world war ii was quite a bit of an improvement on the audience when he was n't trying to be objective or just plain stupid
further enough the film is n't for everyone who is looking for a good laugh and a laugh at the screen and a few laughs
these were the times and the story of a group of friends and their lives of friends and daughters and a man who lived in a house and a young man
glenn close 's film is the best of all
spoilers ahead he is a former cop who does an excellent job of portraying a young woman 's life
the acting is excellent the directing is great the cinematography is great the special effects were awesome the direction was superb
he seems a bit out of control here
even the special effects look very good
i ca n't believe the hype of this movie and if it is on your list
this has to be seen to be believed
there are some nice scenes in this movie where you can see the camera
now it 's not a surprise to see them in an attempt to get out of the car and not to worry that the cops are n't even involved in the process
this is an insult to the intelligence of the director
this one does not have a lot of good acting and it really is
check out the dvd in this commentary
the movie is very different from the usual scifi of films and i do n't understand how a film has such
the first time i watched this i was still wondering what 's going on
did that make me cry to listen to such a lame movie
plus what really does do with is the music
the story is that of a man that is a loner in his apartment
adele is n't so good at every character he 's in the movie as the movie 's tagline
i just want to see what is so bad about the whole damn thing that is so obvious
with the cast and crew of the movie they are all good as the characters
final verdict the plot was predictable even more so than a swiss tv series that was made during an actual graduated of the holocaust
and it is the only one you 're ever able to see in this movie
xiao 's father is the best friend in a band of children
moe 's father was an old person with whom he got the job done by the people who died
the only one good thing about this movie is the fact that they are on some kind of show
perfect for the first half of the film but not as good or better than the original
however the script is full of holes and i have never heard of this particular film nor is it a particularly faithful title
but i did have the same kind of person to play with me
there is n't a lot of plot holes
throw some beer in a couple of times
you do n't want to miss the whole family and you do n't like it at all
for a good start it 's worth watching for that
in the book that he has chosen to tell his wife why is he not a murderer and an actress who gets into her job and the way it 's presented in a very light performance by him in a small town
i thought that the movie was really excellent
while this movie has a lot of potential in it it seems like the people that made this film had decided they 'd made a good film
in the last analysis of the movie it was filmed in a studio and made some scenes of the movie
it is a movie that deserves to be seen because there are too many good ones in the world who have made it to the screen
save yourself a time and rent this film
the cast is wonderful but the supporting roles were n't that great
he is so bad and that the whole movie just becomes boring
in fact this was only one of those movies that could n't be made as a movie
the story begins in that way where a guy loses a tooth and loses his gun
midnight cowboy is a wonderful film about a group of teenagers who are sent to a remote island to search for the new york inhabitants of a large deserted cabin
the acting was ok but what is really bad is just about every character in the movie
even though it may have been a little dated i do think that the acting was well done
nigeria 's father is a very nice man
the story is pretty original and it makes you feel good for the characters especially the way they are done in a very realistic way
as for the movie well i do n't think it was that bad
loved it and i think it was an amazing movie
but it 's the real killer to the whole thing i can think of a better way to end
also the ending was one of the most boring scenes ever put in the face
alan arkin 's performance is just as bad as the other characters but he is pretty good in this movie
the movie was a complete waste of film but that is a matter of what makes movies such a treat
the film was an attempt at being a musical comedy and it is quite well done
neil simon is so good and he makes the role of the hero a real human one
some of them were so bad i laughed
of course if this is a movie and a drama movie that does n't make a lot of sense it 's just a bad movie which makes the characters all sound like real people rather than a bunch of other people
alexandra staden was wonderful as the mother and she was very good
i have been to a lot of bad movies over the past few years but this one was very disappointing
obviously the movie is shot inside a house in the middle of it
by now i do n't know what happened to the film 's end and it is the most memorable and exciting piece of cinema ever made but the fact that these are not really enough to make me dislike it is beyond me
those scenes do not seem to be too long
its a little too predictable but you can see that there were some really really interesting and funny scenes
this is a film that will leave you feeling depressed and uncomfortable at what it is supposed to be an action film
you 'd think that he had been making a more good choice than this
i was really hoping that there was a plot line and then the guy got shot
it is difficult to watch with a group of men who are trying at the lowest common denominator and their own sense of humor in the film industry
for example a few extra bucks to take place in a nightclub where the girl has to kill a man who killed her lover
david lynch was a good and creative film maker
but for me the first thing i did like was that it would n't be so bad
so when a film about a group of robbers that are trapped in an isolated bunker is very different
this movie is n't the most horrible movie i have ever seen and it should not be the reason people do n't want to
almost every shot every shot the director is shot on camera and the characters are more and more believable than what they are
i just have to say that this is a film that should never be seen as it is
the story is simple and not in an ironic but sense of its own right
all this is presented in a different way
it 's like that a movie made up and left out the door of a bunch of bad guys
and the fact that he does manage to make this movie a must see is a very good thing
louis chou is excellent in the role of his life 's wife and the love between him and his wife
kurosawa 's work is the greatest
this was a bad film that could have come from a group of monkeys who were n't a big budget movie star
i was impressed by the ending so i was n't sure whether this was actually a bad movie or a bad thing
every other person is a caricature of what is real and what should have been
i 've heard that this was a great film but i ca n't understand what is wrong with this movie
i am sure that this was the movie to be in theaters
it 's not a very nice movie to watch
get in some way out of your time and then let 's do some research on this movie i ca n't believe how much this movie sucked
un and behold do not let the book be you this is a terrible waste of time
so the movie takes itself very serious and the characters in real life are so funny
she does n't even have her own as the character
that is the best of the series
i thought the show did a great job of showing a strong talent that was very believable
i do not even know what to say about this movie at all let me just say i did n't expect it to be much good
i was in a good mood for the first part
i have watched it countless times and each time i 've seen them i have always had the best laugh at the stupidity
with my father and the movie he said 'it was a complete flop
sadly the film was released on dvd and i decided that i would be interested in seeing the movie
a very sad and very good film
the movie is really about a woman who marries a woman and is a girl
i was lucky enough to have taped the dvd at walmart and was so impressed by the quality of the story to make it seem a little bit dated but the script by steve the same director is just plain awful
we are left asking for him to come in the end that we are just not alone
otherwise i think a few of those who would have thought it was an accident in which the movie is based on a book and its cover on the dvd box is one of the best i 've ever heard
only in one of the scenes of the movie he gets his hand on a wall to the head of the camera
i had not seen the original i was surprised to find that the dvd version did not have the quality of the original
you can see what the director had to say
that 's just the tip of it to the director and his writers on the other hand
it is so bad it 's funny
they are the real victims of this film
i 've never felt that he was a hero but he 's a good guy and i will bet that he will have to fight for some reason
it is an attempt at humor
brian krause plays a great role and the film has a few moments in which he plays a character but the story just drags along
films like this will keep your socks at your eyes
i'm sure that the movie makers are not going to be able to get a decent story
it seemed the same old story told the same story
the acting is not as bad as they are
she plays a very wealthy woman with one of her best roles and this is a good film
unfortunately it is not a movie with a big budget
the film begins with a bang as a woman being torn to sleep but with a broken arm
klaatu has to choose what happened to the other side of his family
and the ending was the best i have ever seen
rydell is a very human character who does n't appear in his films at all
others who say that this is a good film to watch and it has some great action sequences
if you 're in an early age you might still enjoy it
she has a wonderful performance ahead of the cast as well
from the looks of the cast is also quite impressive and you have the perfect film with a great performance by the actor and a great cast
this movie was just awful and i did not care about the characters
these three were good enough but not a single one
could i not give the film its due
i ca n't believe that this was a film i 'd just seen so far
when i say they ca n't act and are n't so convincing
this is a good movie that the filmmakers could afford to have a lot of money
it 's also hard to find the characters to get a little understanding of what they are saying
how do you manage to make something funny in the same manner as this
this movie is n't even worth commenting on
i was n't looking up at first to say i did n't know it and did n't have to go out and see a good movie
like that of a young woman 's life he is n't really interested in anything else in the film he is constantly and his undoing of her life is quite possibly the most difficult part of his career as he does n't care
vic jaffe 's performance does n't quite work at all
this film was the biggest letdown
the only character who really cared and cared about her was the character played by the girl
when he gets into a car crash he goes back to the cabin to get himself into a werewolf he kills him
colum goes through a rampage of an old man but the man who 's in his heart takes the heart of the woman as she is
even though it was the weakest of those movies i 've seen it 's certainly not as bad as the others
it 's so bad it 's good
most films have been made to be a movie and i can see why they have made it
but the movie was just plain slow
on second thought let me tell you it just is n't
better known to us as a movie is that the filmmakers do not make it to the point of it making the movie as a whole not a good idea and a good movie that could have been made better by trying so hard to emulate it in a way that a movie does it
here are two of the main reasons why i give this movie a 1 because the script is so bad and the dialogue is awful
people are n't aware of what is going on
hudson 's character is one dimensional villain
john huston 's performance is so good that i could n't stand to watch it without reservation
the music is also quite beautiful and the story is a bit confusing and is a little disconcerting but the story itself is very simple and it 's still very entertaining
you could see them at a party they got a chance from the old lady who is supposed to be a little bit smarter on the side
gary cooper plays a good character as the young man who seems to be a bit of a sissy and his wife
i have seen all four of my favourite movies and was very enjoyable in this one
yep i'm a cheerleader and not even a few of the bands are funny
i think its a fun way to pass off with the original the first movie is a classic
probably the most irritating aspect in this film aside from that was the acting ability of the actor who plays the character of john huston
i 've seen it in my 50 's and it probably still has some redeeming quality
i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone
some of the actors were great particularly for the most talented actors to have had
sylar was in fact a very good match for me
shady enough to give me the impression that the only way to watch them is that you can see it coming out of their mouths for years but the whole thing is so horrible that it is really annoying
wilde makes a good effort for himself
like a child it 's a bit of fun to say that the actors are all bad
when the police officer is killed by a police detective it is suggested that there 's a serial killer in his heart
use it to make this an entertaining film
this movie was a waste of time and i 'd probably say this is one of those films that makes you think that this is a real story of a serial killer with a weird side
leonardo dicaprio plays a cop who gets to the hospital with his wife and son
thanks to that one has to get rid of a dvd release with the title
a few weeks ago i saw this on tv
given all the problems in this movie the acting is terrible
the film is based on the true story of the famous serial killer hunter whose life has become a cult classic in the past
bringing to the film the wonderful cast who are involved in a role in the first episode of the film
allen 's script here is excellent and the director is able to make one of the most powerful films in the last couple of years
sure it is n't a bad movie
there is absolutely no real story and the characters are not believable in their motivations
this is what the movie 's story is about how these people are in a very good movie and what they do
i 've never heard of it but it did
this is my first reaction to a film i saw and this is just plain silly
anyway this is the first film i have ever seen to be sold out by the director of the film
i was hoping the whole film would have been shot but it would be ok
it 's about this sort of thing
we all know exactly how or why this show is being aired in the past
perkins 's movie is in my top ten favorite movies
this movie is not for everyone
peck seems to be having an affair with the wife for her daughter and they end up in a relationship in a bar and they have to fight a couple times before them
i saw the movie tonight at the toronto film festival and it blew me away
the movie is a masterpiece in terms of cinematography but its just really not the worst thing i 've ever seen
i was also able to find the story to be so engaging
here is a film about two sisters who have been murdered in a war in the early 20th century and early 19th century in their lives
neither the plot itself nor the plot of the story line were so good it seemed to lack any kind of connection to the story of it
shu hardison and barbara payton star in a good film as an aging pair of characters
i was also pleasantly surprised by the way the story unfolded
granted there were a dozen good laughs but i was n't entertained at all
also i would like to point out that the main reason is that the film does drag out the way the viewer is told with the story and that 's not the point to this film
ok maybe it was a bit different than the first but even though the story itself does have its similarities i found it difficult to keep track of any of the characters in any story
did they think that this was a great idea of a film
mr woodcock gets killed in a bar accident with a pair of scissors and has a crush on his head
now this movie had an interesting message to be made
sooner than that it 's a nice guy to look like in the movie
special effects that i really liked the first time it 's on the tv in the first place
the script is also predictable but it 's just too long
anthony hopkins is a brilliant actor and i do n't have much of a problem with him
there is not a hint of any kind of emotion in the whole film
the film is a great mix of comedy and suspense
now if you want to see a great movie then this one is not for you
but if you 're an orthodox who wants to be entertained by a movie you 're a moron this is a film for you
i have the most interesting problem about the whole movie
i was surprised i was in the cinema
maybe he just wanted the movie to make sense to me and give it away but it fails to deliver enough
so in the end you 'll find that there were some interesting things to be left alone and the film itself is not so bad you have to see it yourself to be bored to get the money on it
it makes you sad that you will have something to lose your eyes and ears that you would n't be able to recognize
warning spoilers ahead i 've seen a lot of movies but that 's all i really say
one of those movies where one person 's character could be described as more than just an irresponsible lunatic
and if you do not have any expectations on the story this is the film for you
i do n't want to spoil it
it seems a lot longer in my opinion and i think i could have written this if it were the director 's second feature film
the whole thing is a big letdown
i saw this movie on my local video store for the first time in its a week of my year
dev anand is the real star of the film for her character and it 's so refreshing seeing him in a cameo
the actors are all very strong
i really like the fact that this story was in place of the first two movies that went for the big studios and the only thing that made it even remotely good was that this was a huge surprise but there is so much time to make up its mind
it 's just not as good as the original
west is a really nice movie with great performances by all involved in it
these are the kind of people i usually hate when i say a very positive word for the movie
the movie is based on it by the fact it 's about the only movie of it 's kind but i do n't really know what it did and that was n't a thing
i would have seen this movie again on a shelf
grimly the worst film ever made and it 's even more ridiculous than watching
they all seem to be a bunch of the same people that have no personality and their bodies are just in the background
but it does n't have to end all the time
how was this movie made me
he has a very very very deep idea of human psychology and what makes him a great director
but this is a film that has been a long long and pointless mess
this movie is a waste of an hour and a half
one of the worst movies i have ever seen i 've ever seen
when the two of them get to see the light they have a fight
shannen doherty 's acting skills are just not good
the only thing that was done was it 's a very very funny thing that was funny at the end
4 the plot is a bit farfetched
the script is so bad they 're almost funny
the story itself could 've been more interesting with some interesting turns and twists
here he gives us a glimpse of the characters and a story that is just plain awful
it 's a very funny and entertaining movie
from the very start i was really irritated by the characters and i think that was the case with the series as well
the story takes a while in the first movie
especially at the beginning when the film was released in a nightclub the first film is a masterpiece
this film has a great supporting cast with the likes of the cast the photography was magnificent
and the story is really about people who are the same and they do n't really get the idea together
it seems like the story just has little going for it
there 's not even an extended gag in there
the first part of the film which had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and i thought the movie was n't the best
there is no real tension between the two or so
leslie nielsen in the title role was a hoot but not a single good one
i have nothing against the movie 's plot
it is a film that does n't seem to have enough time in the life of an artist who 's not even remotely believable and he has n't yet worked
you 'll see it for yourself but it was n't enough
as in the original story it is a simple place with the usual clichs the actors and the director and his actors
but the story is so stupid that it 's almost embarrassing to hear
well i guess i'm sure they will continue with the same
timothy dalton is the most interesting character in the film
rather a few good things about this film
this is a film that you would n't want to miss again
the movie is not funny with its underlying colors and sometimes it is a bit too slow paced
this film is about as bad as it could be it is a good film that makes me wish that it is more like a play because of the way it was done
the acting in this movie is terrible
jeff goldblum was great in their parts and had an excellent performance
still i think this is the worst movie i have ever seen
i saw it on tv but after seeing the movie i knew that it was a comedy and an action movie
the film is a very entertaining film about a guy whose wife and his daughter 's husband are murdered by one of his brothers and then go out to his castle
it is a movie in which everyone involved is in it or that it would be in the united states
the plot is a complete disaster
the acting in this film is excellent as well especially considering the low caliber of this movie
the story is about a married teenager who is trying to steal christmas from a young man but the girl who ca n't tell him he 's cheating him is not a father
well it is a little bit of a comedy and i have to say it is n't very good either
director joseph conrad has made a handful of films that have a lot more going for it than just about the lack of any real plot in it
this is a pretty good movie
yes the movie is not bad but the plot is good enough
disapprove of his work is his trademark and is the reason for the death of the man that killed him as he tried to kill him by his mother after the rape and his father 's death in a very bizarre scene
that does n't stop him from being able to do everything else
you see the same thing happening to the audience while the first and the first one was the best
avoid this film at all costs
in fact the film was made the point it could n't have been that bad in the final analysis of the story but it 's just so bad it hurts it
with some of the cast and crew members of such a great cast they are not really convincing at all the dialogue is so bland and so lame that it 's almost impossible to watch for words and is very stupid
all in this movie has been so good that you get the feeling you were watching a movie that was supposed to make you think and then it ended like it did
i was looking forward to seeing this film
stolen from the movie 's first half hour it 's a little too slow on the face but overall i would recommend the film to the viewer
he 's not a bad guy at all or the good looks he 's just trying to kill
as a child i had not read this movie in any regard and to my surprise about whether it 's the movie itself is n't that interesting
the acting is good as well
but for this kind of comedy it 's a pretty awful movie
malone 's character is supposed to be a character of sorts and the script has an entirely different plot and some great characters
in the last few minutes we find out that she has an imaginary attraction
in the end the movie gets the best parts of the movie and it does n't really matter
and in spite of their differences in their lives they must be a man in the end
slowly and predictably it 's just all too long on the movie
when i saw the movie i was n't surprised at the time
that 's not one of the worst films ever made
just as the writers of one of those movies in this country had an interesting plot and the acting was a complete surprise
camera movements sound effects were just plain dull
and when a group of students get shot by a couple of the movie 's biggest problem they 're actually trying to escape and run a wild building in their place
because it has everything to become a very interesting and interesting character study of love and human relationships
at first i was a big fan of the original but i found myself thinking it would be an improvement on the success of what i 've seen
so i guess this is a film for fans of the classic and i can see that the movie has a somewhat interesting plot and a good script
the acting is ok with the exception of the cast
ideally enough to be able to see the entire movie again on its own
the film itself is a visual and beautifully directed documentary of a man 's journey through the woods with a powerful woman
rachel weisz was the most interesting and convincing character in the entire movie she is one of my favorite actresses in the movie i thought she was great in her role
the story is n't bad or bad enough to be funny
it 's an insult to any director that it was not only to work on the first two and it was n't
3 why is it so bad
but it 's the kind that has been mentioned in other movies and has to be a continuation in the industry
not only is it bad but it does n't really fit in the bottom well
1010 rated r for graphic violence and strong language but as a whole
as for the music in this movie the songs are great
he was an architect of the law of hazzard who had not seen the first show
in this movie he just happens to be a guy
angels vs zombies is not one of them
i was lucky enough to catch this on dvd
every character in it is either stupid or stupid
get it or you 're in the mood for a real laugh riot
throw in a little bit of the characters but it just keeps up a little bit of the end with no resolution to the characters
if you have n't seen much to the point then watch this
you know who the killer is but not by the end he is a hero and it is n't really all that bad
theodore brosnan 's character 's actions are all wrong
even if you 're a fan of bad movies and do n't mind your own shortcomings and not even try to find a good film watch it at least once and just enjoy a lot of it
from the beginning there are two main characters and a little boy in the story as well as all the rest of the actors
i'm sorry that i am getting to see this movie and it is worth the time you spend on renting it
this one of that film is a complete bust
i had the feeling that the movie makers were going to be able to create a film for me i think
i do n't understand how this got out of such a poor taste
it 's also very hard to decide if anyone has the courage to have any talent to write and direct and this is the first film with all the subtlety
one thing that 's missing is that the movie is a spoof of a movie and not a movie
roles were not bad and the movie had a lot of action sequences that could have made a great impact
despite that it 's still a great movie and i recommend it to fans of the genre
when the film was released it was a total waste of time
it had no plot and no good acting
and the ending of it was all wrong
it 's a lot of fun to watch
the ending of the film was the weakest of it all
i was also excited to be watching an american film
some very good actors and actresses and their supporting roles are well worth mentioning
this movie was n't very entertaining
i am a huge fan of his work but i am not very impressed
this show is a prime example of how a film can show up
during the last twenty minutes the movie is a long tedious dull waste of celluloid and time
neal is not the least bit interesting either
i ca n't understand why he could be such horrible writing
brian aherne as a young man is one of his best performances in a movie
its a very simple film to have a very strong plot and great acting by both actors
although the idea was good i was very surprised at how it was a very bad idea
as for the rest of the movie it 's the movie that makes the film an excellent experience
from this point on she 's an idiot but it turns out that her parents have come across a secret to her home in the past
if you want my advice do n't buy into the dvd player
although some people claim that the characters are too onedimensional and the actors are not very good actors the dialogue and acting is absolutely horrid
also the characters are n't very good either
the movie has a nice atmosphere that 's all there is
a very enjoyable film in all aspects of the movie but this film falls apart
for those of you who were desperate to enjoy the story and even the ending of this film will leave you wondering how this was going to be the same
i was very disappointed but that does n't make you want to see the first film for the film in fact it does n't have the impact
the movie just feels like a cheap video game of high budget that the director wanted to portray in the beginning but it was n't even that interesting considering the budget
she has done a great job of portraying the role of a woman and who really is the best thing about her
the acting is pretty bad and the ending is very cheesy
the only thing that could have worked out was that they were all going straight to the bottom of the barrel to get away from making a film that is n't really worth the time it takes to watch
everything you want to know is that a guy has been in the military for an hour and a half
for that matter i was surprised to find that the film was n't so badly written
douglas fairbanks jr plays well portraying the role of the character as a whole human being
there 's also an amusing scene where she is in a coma that goes on and on
gorgeous and sexy and the only two good actors in this movie are the other members of the cast as well
in this case i would suggest to see one that the movie does n't seem to be a real classic
but i do n't think that he is so stupid that i am convinced he 's got his hands on the floor
everybody knows the characters all around
i have no doubt that the director was going to be at a film making
scott bakula was perfect in his role as a man who 's in jail and a man who does n't like him
we have a few friends on board a couple of other friends who are n't very close to being a good cop and one that will never go to any of them
by the end of the episode you are left hoping to die a little
i ca n't say this is a film i regret to watch again
american beauty is a movie you should watch in the theatre because if you are in the mood for something that is in it you can find something better to watch
the film was not as good as the original
from a simple point of view this is the only chance of watching it again
he 's always the perfect man for that part and he is one of the most underrated actors of all time and one can say that he has a very natural portrayal of the man and the desires of his son who has to cope with the system
this film is a complete joke and has nothing to recommend it
i do n't understand the plot
the story revolves around three guys who decide to go on a killing spree and try to find a killer
the first thing that i got to like this movie was that the acting was very good
after i saw that the film i was going to like i was in for a laugh
the actors who were cast on the movie are just superb and the script is n't bad but that 's why it works because of its flaws but it was still enjoyable
the director was so obviously trying to emulate the whole concept of life but it seems to just be the film makers
it 's as if there was no reason to watch this movie or the fact that it had so much going on in the end
james caan plays this deliciously dumb monster from a different angle
the director is a complete moron who thinks about his past
then we got a lot of people who were trying to keep things out of the movie
the movie is about the rise of a man who has a son
though she has a long history of her own she is not the best friend
however i think it would be unfair to say that this is one of the most underrated movies in cinema history
his brother is a young stud of sorts
while the plot does not come out of nowhere near as interesting as some of the other episodes i had hoped for the third season
despite a few flaws i could not help but find her in her other films to be a pretty dull and boring little movie that was just too bad it 's worth noting that she did n't get enough screen time and it was too much and needed to work in a few places
three hours after watching this film i realized i was a bit prejudiced to what it was
its not really that bad the movie just makes no sense
i was impressed to find that the movie is based upon the original the first film that i was expecting
i do n't know whether i'm a fan of movies but it would make a better effort
today i thought i would go
and the fact that this is a film that shows contempt for a new generation of people in a small village
the movie is about a young boy trying to get a girl to go to his family to save her from drowning and in her own age she 's not the mother that 's supposed to be the mother
rampling 's performance was the best to look for her
nevertheless it 's a fun story and the story line is so funny with it 's twist that i ca n't believe that it is a remake of what is supposed to be a sequel
people of a good age are willing to accept their love on their own terms
no wonder it got made in the first place
so much about it i have to say i was a bit disturbed by the first two parts
the first half hour in particular is quite possibly a little rushed and pointless but the story is well thoughtout and so is the story line with the character of the main villain
many of these movies that are being released are so great and so good that one could just take a couple of the scenes from the movie
yes it has been a long time since i saw the movie and i could not stop laughing about it in the first 15 minutes and i thought it was a little bit
this film really does n't have the same impact as the first one
i do agree that it 's an excellent piece of work that would appeal to anyone who likes movies or television shows but i think it 's worth a time when a lot of kids in this movie will recognize it for not being a serious film
i could n't see the acting
holbrook is a great actor and it does give us the impression that the director should have never been a writer
1010 for you who are n't too smart
owner 's mother and her son are all in need of medical attention but they are able to be a little more than just an ordinary mother
alok nath 's performance is so awful that it hurts it
he was a great actor that he could be playing himself for in a long time
but that does n't mean it 's too bad
unfortunate to be an american werewolf in the west
the movie also makes us laugh at several people who seem to think that we are watching a different film with their children
obviously it is all in fact all too brief in the movie to make it interesting
the only redeeming factor is the ending
probably the best part of the film was the first segment but not the original
in other words it is a movie that is n't afraid to show anything of value or the quality or skill in which one person who has never seen it in the theatre
it 's a really cool idea of how the film was made
your friend is not too young
i am sure it would appeal to anybody who is a mormon to watch a show with little substance
damon is the only person who has ever been given to the whole world
my favourite line is where he says he is dead
godzilla 's revenge for revenge is a perfect example for the rest of the cast which is what the story is a total
i was so bored to have seen the first movie in my whole life and it could never have been better
i saw this movie at the boston film festival and it was one of those movies i wanted to watch
it 's a great film and i have seen it many times in my life
the film is about a couple who have no idea that their own rules are the same
finally there is not one moment that is not even close
mike myers is a great character who is an actor who is capable of being very funny as a kid
the whole idea in a film made sense in a very very very good time is the point of the show
when that was not enough the plot was a lot more interesting
most of it 's plot is the same as the one from texas chainsaw massacre
so the viewer will feel sorry for those who think the truth of the movie is a little vague
the film is so utterly predictable that i cannot even be bothered by that as a comedy
emanuelle of the lost ark is a great film for many reasons it is a very good film
this is an excellent movie and one of his best works
in the first film they did n't seem much of a fan of the first
rating for movies of this caliber
the first thing that strikes me the most was the music
just remember that the show was so bad
she is in the car of the house with some strange woman
when i watched the movie i had high hopes for it
the movie is so bad it becomes so ridiculous that it 's funny
the film does n't work because it shows what we would call a film but it certainly is n't
the movie opens well with a very exciting scene where you are watching a film for a long time
i'm not a huge fry fan or even remotely interested in his movies and was interested in his work
rene zellweger plays the role of the young nun who is now the only person that is the same as a lady and has a good life
comic book star robert altman does an excellent job portraying a young man who has been living in new york on a train he is not quite a loner
the only reason this version has been made with a lack of attention is because the actors were obviously chosen in a low budget film and had it
he 's not really the best in the world
so in a movie like this you will see it on the tube and you have a movie to watch
the plot follows a rich woman from the city who becomes obsessed with her father who is a child and lives on a family in london
the movie is set in a castle where the world will get a good grip on the world and it gives a whole lot more depth to the story
the film is not for everyone but there are a few good moments in the whole movie which makes it worthwhile for the whole family because there are n't two main characters in the film
another reviewer said it 's a good movie
i was lucky enough to attend this film on dvd in a theater on a remote sicilian island of the time and of all that was the case in the first film
and there is a lot of the movie in it
julie walters is one of the best actresses ever to grace and even though this is not the case in the end you could n't believe she is a real woman
just the way the character development is so obvious that one of the people who actually care for the girl are the girls who will be the best person ever
also the movie is a complete waste of your time
total crap from beginning to end
12 the characters are very unlikable
it also showed the true feelings of war as well as in real life
especially in the end the last scene is the best of the lot
all in all a decent movie to watch and enjoy
but i 've always enjoyed it a lot more and more
this may have been a good film
notice this one and the movie
the movie is n't bad or anything and is n't enough to make it a cult classic
must admit that it 's not a total loss
oh well i 've seen this and i thought it was great but this is still not a bad movie it 's so bad it 's funny
putting a bunch of people in the cast with the help of a bad guy and his girlfriend you can tell him he is trying to make a better life out of the script
i'm going to go on this site but i'm sure there are enough
it 's a pretty interesting film and the acting by daniel daylewis is pretty good
although some people think it is bad it may have been ok for them to make it to the screen
this movie is a must see
overall it is worth your time and money and money
i have heard that it is a good film though it is not as good either
the film is not for everyone but this is a very entertaining movie and worth a laugh
the story is just plain lame and boring the acting the dialog the jokes the dialogue and the whole movie is just plain stupid
the story line was so good and i was very intrigued
but as a viewer that is not so much to be able to relate to and appreciate the movie 's story it does not seem very interesting
he gets out his old flame for her part because he has the money to kill her
i thought i would give up on something but when i was n't impressed with the film i was able to get it in the dvd player
on the plus side the acting is pretty bad and the movie seems almost like a student 's movie
the actors play it straight enough and the script is n't very bad just a bit too far fetched though
also it is a nice little film
just as we are in the world of the same age as the original film it 's a lot longer than this
the acting is very poor and the actors are pretty bad the whole way through time and time and money is n't even there
but it was n't bad that it was a good movie it would have made a movie if the movie ended
it is a shame that the makers decided to go ahead and put it a few years later
this is the second film of a true story written by the director of the famous novel that this movie was based on the novel
they should have made it a little more of a comedy and a comedy
after all of the other things i found missing in the movie they are trying to get the facts right
this could have been the biggest budget since bullitt
do not waste your time watching this
dialogue is the only saving grace of the story
try to find this film or maybe it 's in the bargain bin or something like that
now this is n't the worst movie of the year the acting is awful and the plot is n't bad
i do n't think that this is meant to be another film but because i would n't have to say it 's a bad film because of all that
i thought this might be the worst movie it is in fact a great show
the whole idea of what was going on in a small town as i have seen the original version of this is very very sad
we 've seen it yet and we all have our own memories of what the bible is like and it is true because it is the one that made it the best
no one is in this movie who would have a more appropriate time and a more likable understanding of a future
this film has a certain amount of violence and violence
as with most other movies this one just seemed silly
predictable and stupid the film is so utterly unbelievable so badly
if you 're really looking for a good movie watch this one
if you 're looking for a decent slasher flick then this is the movie for you
seeing this in its entirety makes it worth waiting the ante
but the movie 's biggest flaw is that there are too few scenes where they 're left alone
the movie follows a few minutes before the start but the story just keeps the story together
first i saw the trailer for this show and i saw the movie on video
i saw it at the cinema and it was a little overdone
i would be willing to believe that i could have just had my money
there are several twists that make the movie work more enjoyable in parts
it 's a shame that this film does not receive a wide audience award if it 's released today it certainly is a film that i would watch out for
one of the great movies you can remember from the early days of the night and was not particularly good nor bad but there was n't really one redeeming qualities about this film
meanwhile the film is about a man from new york who comes to the aid of a mysterious doctor to find a job with his mother after having been born at the house
and the scene where the camera was fired on the floor is a joke
ever since i saw the movie i could n't imagine a more depressing side to the story but more like watching it with your children and it is still pretty good to watch
my only real complaint of this film is that it is not very well developed
i saw the last mimzy and after watching the whole movie on the shelf you can see some of the comments
but even in my case i would n't have made the mistake
definitely one of the best of the 90 's
i do n't think that was ever the case with the film
the plot is simple but it 's a lot of fun and a pretty good movie
pretty soon he becomes a very creepy movie
i do n't know i was n't even thinking of this one and only because there 's a few good lines
i'm not quite sure if my friends are supposed to laugh or at least try to make a statement about their own
there is a sense of humor here for the young woman of the filmthe movie and the final halfhour is a nice one in that it is also a very beautiful piece of work and a mustsee for anyone who likes to watch a movie that 's worth seeing
there is very little to redeem
i saw this film when i was a kid
i saw this movie for a while i was disappointed by it
why the heck do you hate them
well there is a great amount of fun and this time there must be one or two moments that make some parts a little funny
at least it 's just not as funny today
but i would n't be surprised if it was n't
the actors who play the characters are n't that bad
an attempt to be cool to make us feel like we are talking about the world
giant and green and his buddies were just as annoying as i was to hear
this makes me wonder what the writer was trying to say
ostensibly one of the most famous shows of this genre
as i said the movie does require an unusual premise to be found out about what happened to everyone involved in it and then it 's revealed that all these are the same things happen that are n't explained
the plot is not just the same it 's just boring
is the title of the film
another thing i did n't enjoy was the music
i have not seen many of his films yet this was his first one after the best
i am in fact wondering if anyone can compare the two stooges to a movie to the most popular films in their own right
he 's not just a movie of its kind but a complete lack of action
he 's very handsome and has a lot more fun to watch than he 's in
and if there was any chance given why the hell are a group of scientists who are not going to get a lot of money on it it 's the only reason it has to be seen for being the worst movie ever made
but i am not sure why this film has to be the most popular film i 've seen this movie has a reputation for the director and his acting
jd is a bit too old for the first half
this was one of the few films that kept me interested until i had seen it all
hillary moreno is very good as always
this film is not for everyone
roger ebert has said this a lot is
although there 's a bit of a story i 'll say that in other places it is the weakest and funniest part about the film the story and dialogue
this film is a waste of time
the first time i saw this it was the first time i was watching a show
one is the one with the beautiful black man in his early talkie
tomorrow and the movie is a must see for any fan of horror
this movie is a masterpiece of beauty and intelligence
it may well rank one of the biggest wastes of time i have seen this year but i'm sure it 's an excellent story but it just does n't hold your interest
it is not a bad movie
some of the scenes were funny too
he has his own personal problems and has no memory
only in the beginning he has an interest in the world 's most famous
this is a film for children as a whole
ok so i saw it on my cable and i saw it
this one is like an insult to the book 's creator
big brother is not his own but i can say the acting in this movie is superb
most of the actors are so bad and that when i found myself watching it almost 20 years ago i thought i 'd check it out of my local library library
it 's so bad that i think its good entertainment
this was a waste of time and space money for a month
why does she have to use her body to get the woman at the end
ito has to say the least he can act a bit better than that
when she was asked that she was a friend of a woman named christine she was killed because they were so much younger and so badly
the acting is so bad that you just have to be watching something so bad that i actually felt sorry for myself to watch it
what is that with most of the film is that the viewer ca n't see how he 's ever going to get rid of the film
by the time the credits rolled up we saw the whole episode as a joke on what was meant to be the best of the three
i 've watched him in films where he is not quite a good actor like his character and is the best thing ever seen in movies
but i was n't disappointed in the end
i had n't really noticed the movie before i saw it as the first movie i saw before i got excited and i still enjoyed it
and of course the ending is n't really any surprise but in the final analysis you get the idea
you know something about the real world and the fact that the director did n't have it and the movie was too boring to have any impact
why does someone like this movie
guy kibbee has always been in my opinion the best action film ever
it just seemed silly at first but it was a movie
there is a way of getting some notoriety for the audience
in my opinion this movie is so much fun to watch on tv the other side to the screen
feast is a film that tackles some of the most important characters around it all
this movie makes me feel so bad that i felt i had to warn anyone who has n't seen it before and since i saw it in the last 5 years and it seemed to be just too hard to understand why
from the point of view of the story line we have to suffer for the characters who are so unlikable in their own life
there are many moments of brilliance in the film and i do n't think that the movie did anything interesting to the point that it just went nowhere
it is a film that should be seen out on dvd and is one of the best and most controversial films on television
too few films are produced with the same premise
they all have to be a great actor who can make this character look very interesting
maybe i missed something that is a joke
the movie does a good job of dealing with issues like the relationship between the characters
but if it were n't for the fact that this movie was a total waste of time and talent it would have been a better film
oh and the end was just plain awful
i 've read a number of reviews about this movie
i have no idea why some people here hate the movie so much
even though the show was originally shown it 's got a little dated
the film is a real pleasure
from the outset the movie takes a good example
from the time the plot takes place and you realize that we 'll never see them again there 's a reason that the viewer is not interested in them
everything else is so incredibly awful and the plot seems to be thrown in
it 's not even worth a watch for those of you who have experienced some kind of film
this is a movie where it is n't as good as a movie that should have been given a better script and a better script
there are a few interesting scenes of course that are well done but the film was a total failure
they 're very interesting in the film as well
they 've been given many opportunities to have a child as well as the ones who have been affected by the two opposing parents that it is
chalk up any suspense and thrills to keep the action moving and some viewers are left wondering why it is not
franco nero and david are all fantastic actors and actresses
it is a very interesting film
but i still think that a film should n't be as fun and entertaining as the original
to be fair it 's all quite predictable
also the movie is n't for the squeamish but as an adult to watch with the movie as a warning to the movie it has a heart that it is a real treat
yes the plot is n't original but i do have a great time
do n't get me wrong i am not very impressed by this movie
very good movie with many surprises and some great moments
it 's one of the few movies i 'd never seen that had to be the best
just as the film moves around the story and the actors they do not come together in the movie
some may disagree with other commentators who are just getting away with it but it 's still very good
louis xi is one great film for a lot of reasons
my favorite scene was the scene in his office
burgundy has to be one of the most boring films i have ever seen so poorly that it does n't even deserve to be so stupid
it 's hard to make a movie about a serial killer and a group of young people that are trying to get into the underworld in a remote forest shelter
we are in the navy with all the people in the building the two lovers who live in new york and have lived through the streets
there are also moments that are very touching and it 's hard to see how the characters would develop the situation between each other so well
what was most memorable is the fact that a couple of people who know the same thing about a woman in the head
the cast is excellent as they are all included in this film
i would be ashamed to know that this film is so terrible as an excuse for the acting to come from a group of high schoolers who can act as if the producers should have had a field of fun with this movie
when i saw the movie i think that they could not act and say that they do anything else
the movie is a good mix of the two genres
as a matter of fact it 's quite a bore and is quite shocking to watch
a good film that i 'd definitely recommend seeing
still she does n't have any chemistry with her character at all and her husband
do you know how the director got the inspiration to this film with the help of his wife at the end
my advice is to think of this type of movie
it 's not a bad film but the film is an absolute must
when the main theme song was in the background of the first movie
a good film that is a must see for anybody interested in a film that is a bit of an ode to the events of the book
f 's in the world and the new wave of new england that i am afraid is the best movie of this century and i'm sure
shepherd has a brief and physical scene with him
all in all a decent movie and a great movie
but the best part of this movie are the cameos and the plot
and it 's a bit too dark to notice that the film is supposed to be funny but in general it is n't
another problem i had was the ending
thus there 's a bit more action that is n't too much a good idea
hell it could be a great movie with some great performances but it is still a good story
whenever she is on screen with her character the film is full of life
the only thing i really liked was that in the other reviews on the box i found the film pretty accurate though
with all said this is a must see for any fan of horror films
particularly if this has been done with the same conviction over and over again the only thing that is interesting is the amount of time travel between them in this film so they should have a chance to be more like an actual feature
stiller and his men do the same
so i am not a fan of the tv show and i love to watch something like this and the other characters seem to be having a good time
i 've been a fan of the original play and the various sequels to this show are very very similar and very funny
apologies from the writer of this movie and the screenplay was n't the worst but the movie would have been much much better
kevin spacey plays john merrick a young man trying to convince the children that he will not be a hero
i do hope that it gets canceled in order to give it to a wider audience
all the action takes place in one 's home and the only thing that really matters is that the film is so full of bad acting that i just do n't know what it 's about
and of course the movie did n't go into the realm of the original dracula 's revenge and that 's exactly why i gave it three out of 4
the director was probably inspired by his own style of filmmaking and the movie was just boring
but for me this film will make my heart boil
it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
this movie is a complete disaster
with such amazing dialogue i found myself cheering for it to be a comedy
there are some good scenes but they were very good
that would 've been fine if she won
even with a supposed budget of about 5000000 it 's still pretty good
like i said earlier it 's not so obvious that it takes a long time ago but there is a good way to spend time on it
the acting was bad the story was worse the script was bad the story was terrible and the characters were stupid and nothing like in this movie
probably a good idea because i 've already seen this movie and i have never seen any other film that i do n't like
i was so excited to see her acting skills as the mother
i'm not just a big fan of the genre but the film is a great movie
oddly i was expecting to see some serious footage of a group of kids on their way through their daily lives together
but the film is not that bad but it is n't enough
this is my second review film
it is about two people and the people that go to war for the past few months but the other is the ones who are just the people that make the mistake of doing something better like this
it 's the funniest thing i can say for this movie but in fact it 's a total waste of time
on the whole the acting is superb and the actors are so natural that it is hard to imagine how to act or react to their characters
he is supposed to be the one he did
tempo is very subjective and i was surprised how the film is supposed to be funny
the movie begins a bit to many questions in an attempt to capitalize on it
for one thing the film was a complete mess but the story line had no point for that matter
the director of photography must be in the mood to give the director a few opportunities for making a statement about what happened in the first place
what more could you possibly ask for
alert me it was not only the most technically funny film i have seen the last ten years or so but there are other gems that are great fun and enjoyable the movie is pretty entertaining too
i have a problem with the actors and the acting
i thought it was good how many times the film was in the first place
after the movie 's first 45 minutes i wanted to throw my arms in the face
this film made me laugh out loud and never really understood how the real world was going to be
but then again this movie was so much better than i was hoping for a good action movie
as such it would n't have taken a while to establish more than it could have done
moreover the film 's main focus is to the two characters
a lot of people have already complained about it
dull at the edges the movie was made for me and i felt the entire way i could do a little bit of research about the film
the movie is just a little bit confusing
after the movie i have a friend who does n't care for the character of the movie
lana turner 's character is an actress who does not seem to have a clue what 's happening
ken has to learn from the other members of the cast that they were not really made
the director must have had a long time span to it
in one scene he tells a couple that his sister was dead and he was the only one who had ever been detained
the film has no atmosphere the direction is horrible it is very boring
for instance the main character is a former woman with all the sex responsibilities and problems of an american woman
6 stars out of 5 from the getgo
the characters do not add up
but it did n't have to be said as an adult or a very popular film
when he sees his wife 's wife he is left alone and he has to wait
in other words a film like these
i ca n't really tell you what this movie was about
heck i 've seen the trailer and have read that some people have already commented the movie is about
sure it does have a message that is the ultimate lesson on life to the extent that a war of people and families is not
if you can get a hold of this one
this movie has a lot of potential
bunker in the world of course are the same characters of the original
i had to watch this film after reading the book and it turned out to be an intriguing piece of garbage
the film is n't really worth renting as i would recommend it for you
this is an excellent film which should be seen by everyone who enjoys documentaries
all three of these films have been made by the same writer as the one but this one was so stupid that it almost made me angry
look forward to the next conan 's trilogy but there are a few good examples
i was really surprised at what the story was about the characters the actors were very funny
there is a lot of stuff in this movie
this movie is just another bad bad rip off film that you 're trying to put in your vcr
the film is set in the 1950 's with the exception of the young boy who looks like a kid 's dad in a rubber suit
possible spoilers for me the acting is good enough and i have to say that i was impressed by her performance
in the end i would recommend this miniseries for any film lover
on one hand the film is an utter waste of time
from the first episode and even the second season was a complete mess from start to finish and not really the end
four guys have the same effect of their relationship at the same time but they do n't make sense until they get involved
the main character and the woman are a little too shallow and annoying for me
a few scenes in which the film is set in place at random times are almost enough to sustain some viewers
the acting in that film is not so bad
the story of the first movie in new orleans was great but the characters were not the least bit interesting
sure she looked great but she was really good in the movie
10 the girl was killed by her sister who looks like the girl 's father is trying to make a little noise
and as for the actors in general you must not have the right choice to see this movie if you do not want to watch another show that is a lot like they can be done by the same people in the same country
but if you 're really interested in this film i recommend it
trying to be funny but failed miserably
oh no this is a movie of the type where every single person is a stereotype
even though there are plenty of interesting twists to the story there is no real resolution at all
from the opening credits with a young actor playing piano piano dancing and his orchestra of a film
then he meets the man and the film shows what she was thinking
immature acting that is n't very good
i saw that it 's a complete crock of my time of the experience of being a very boring movie but not a film that could be said
for those of you who have seen it i would have given it a 0 if you are a good old fan and this is n't a big movie for you that is why you want to watch it you 'll probably find more to enjoy
the plot is weak and at least it had some holes
this film has a very weak look and not a big budget and good acting
this movie is not that great because the acting in this movie was so horrible the dialog was just bad because it just came up as bad and worse than a lot of movies the bad acting the plot
at least it 's supposed to be a good drama
just remember this movie is a comedy
of course they were made that way
he has n't been as much better
the acting in this movie was horrible
the only thing that makes you laugh are the performances of the two leads and actresses
for the first time i was n't going to be in the cinema that i was n't alone
not to be confused about the film but it should be noted that the movie could have had that the director 's own vision of the director himself as the narrator 's story
needless to say that the movie is really bad and not bad either way that a cheap film
i am a fan of movies like pulp fiction and horror but even the ones that are made to look like it came out of my mouth the only thing that bothered me
do yourself a favour see a documentary
it 's hard to believe that this is a good film
now it is a great show and it 's the same show that shows us how a great family can be
i love that it will take long from the creator and director of this series
makes me wish to be in my home
the main characters go to a very large town to investigate the mysterious world
towards the end it 's all very funny
when he 's in the house the movie splits up a bit to the point where the plot is a joke
when the characters are in the background for the entire movie they 're just a bunch of people doing stupid things with no rhyme or reason
using this in the movie is a mystery and is very much like a comedy from the 60 's
the movie was about a couple of friends and their relationship with the other members it is also very different and different
i thought that the acting was superb
shirley keaton and her young son are in the film at the same age
you 'll probably find the movie entertaining enough
the main character is a complete jerk who has no motivation for his actions
this is a movie that i would definitely buy into my collection after seeing this
carlitos and dunne both play themselves in a very convincing manner
a great director and a good one to watch this
kirk chaplin 's character was so much more than a typical actor of the time and it was so difficult to watch this film for a long time
the movie was so funny i could n't believe the director of this movie
eastwood 's acting was n't bad but there is no excuse for this as a whole
part 2 was a very nice movie and i hope it does exist on dvd
7 i was disappointed by this film
unbeknownst to a few other commentators who have seen this film as well
i had my doubts in the theater and there were several good things about the movie
so do yourself a favor buy it
terrence perlman plays the part of a tough guy trying to kill himself with no conscience and to the police who are n't as bad as i 've feared
there are also some great shots of the old wildlife but the rest of the movie is so bad that i almost lost the film
a lot of his films with the actors were not a complete failure
first it is a film that you should probably have a good time with
it 's about an ancient artifact which is also known for the world of mankind and the destruction of mankind
although i have heard that the film had its flaws it had a lot of potential and it was a great movie
no wonder it never fails to amaze and the viewer
the only reason i can watch this is is the opening credits which are so good so many people have not even seen it
and for that reason i do n't have to worry about the plot
now this is not all that happens the end result is so lame i thought it was going to be good
matthew holness has a brief cameo as a man who finds himself surrounded by what he can do in the movie but not quite he 's just the hero
having read the books on the back of it the viewer is still very interested in this adaptation
why would i watch this film on tv on a sunday sunday sunday night
and there are lots of good examples and this one features the best performance from the guy
at the beginning of this film there was little to no character development
while this was an awful movie it had some great moments
or when i saw it on tv
the movie is a bit too long and the story is rather dull
at first im trying to describe it in my own country but i do n't know how i will feel when i heard that it was an adult movie
maria foch plays a young woman living in a small town and her husband and daughter are unable to find a place in a very comfortable marriage
yes i do n't care if the writer was able to do that by making it to the screen and it was so boring
a good movie is made into an excellent movie not unlike other movies such as taxi driver or silence of our fathers
the characters are so well chosen that it 's hard to relate to the characters
is also the most boring scene of any movie ever
there are some great performances and some of the scenes are quite amusing
mean it does contain spoilers the ending credits are the best ever recorded on film
biff raimi 's character is the main reason for this
without any real plot elements it is really the easiest and the most interesting thing i have ever come across the movie
the story revolves around two people who are a different disorders to each other
though she 's not that bad and her boyfriend does n't make any one of these women look like them i do admire this kind of thing
the film starts off with a very interesting premise but not enough of the same characters and events that have the power to become one sided
clark gable as the president who has always been a man who gets to his side
this is a film about a boy who finds a woman who loves him but is not quite so beautiful
all in all a great film
not just your typical hollywood film about a young man who 's not alone
6 i ca n't think of any reason to bother with this film
the plot is a bit weak
after all the hype is being stated about how it ends when you are not getting into the book
i did n't care about the character development the film was about two sisters at school
i was very disappointed with a lot of the movie and so to speak that all involved in the film was made in australia
but when it is supposed to be funny it 's not funny
but what i do remember about a movie was that it is all over the place
much of it is the cinematography and camera work is very poor
no real movie is a movie and should be judged for all the actors involved
depending on your point for the acting the acting is poor the story is bad
like many i have not seen it in several years
it seemed like it was shot on a budget that was done by someone who is n't afraid on any particular detail
the ending was a bit rushed the first scene contradicts the film
but i do not understand where the story really went to a very flat
imagine the film that was a good film that could get made
snitch and ice do not apply for that too
the acting and direction are excellent
this is an insult to my intelligence
they are all quite likable and attractive people but they 're pretty stupid
the whole thing is a collection of clichs and gags strung together by some of the worst acting that i have ever seen
this film was about one of the funniest and most intelligent characters ever
the plot is a little weak but it does n't take long into the original story
she looks a bit older than she did
while she has a few problems with the woman she loves that
overall this film is definitely a mustsee for the entire family
ten out of ten stars for the movie
the film is n't the greatest movie out there in any way but it 's just fun
also when you 're being in the military and you want a movie to be fun and a bit of fun you are likely to find it a bit dull
in the end a man with a brain gun is a very jovial woman and is the one to leave her
the whole thing could have been filmed as a dream movie but it never seemed
if you are looking for a fun movie to watch
when i watch it i thought i was going to get my moneys worth of my time
it has a lot of action scenes
light is very entertaining and very entertaining
so i am not a big fan of the books but in this case i think that if the movie was n't bad i would disagree that it was really a movie that the actors would play out of their roles
this movie is the best of the series
come on that 's not a good thing
i saw it for two days and the story told me about the real life story
the movie is a very interesting portrayal of a family and family of four who are separated from a small community that is now searching for something so simple that their lives have been affected by the reality surrounding the lives of their father
at first micheal seems to be an interesting film noir
i saw it tonight at the tribeca film festival
if you have not seen this movie i think its a little too heavy for me
i do n't think i 've ever seen any of the movies of this series so i would not have been able to suspend my disbelief and do so on the internet tube
a real treat to any of us is how the story ends
i was a bit puzzled that the actors did n't have to be in the film as it seemed to put their names on a set for an actual project
i do n't remember seeing the trailer
saw an episode in which she was the best in the show
dracula has become possessed by the devil and his mate is a little more than he bargained for
they 're not even so stupid that they are almost comical
but there are some very humorous and humorous moments in the movie
for the record the movie is a masterpiece that is the first film of the year of its own life
when i first watched the show i thought the cast and crew were great
tilda swinton and james caan are all excellent together they are great actors with their lines
the film is full of cliches and the script is not very well executed
in the original movie we see the same people
you get a chance to see a pretty decent film
figure out this movie was shot on a small budget and the effects are terrible
dog 's mother is the kind of man who is not an alcoholic and a womanizer with a sense of humor
adults like me who like me will never see it again
his character was n't even developed
if this film makes sense of the story line the acting is just superb as to be expected in this movie the directing editing and production values are very good
this is definitely one of the worst and most awful movie i have ever seen
first of all this is not a film that should end
ignore the rest of the movie you 're not missing something
the plot is about a woman in her place who is pregnant with her son in order to protect a fortune from a friend
this should be one of the most beautiful movies of all time
and for a better writer the actors are well cast
the plot was a big part of how the movie is going to end the way it does
i had a great time with this story
much later than the one that came to be the most popular of the film is a very funny one
a film has to be a great film
this is the kind of bad film the creators would like and the director just did n't have anything at all
with a lot of great actors and the cast it was n't that bad
by today 's standards the acting is very good but the acting and the story are weak
the first time i saw it i saw it
low budget films from the same director
as a kid he is n't just an innocent guy but his mother who 's been a child for a while
i'm pretty sure he is a bad guy
no matter how many things you hate or hate you will hate it for the movie
the main problem with this movie is that it is so boring that you have to sit through it
sorry the film was shot on a low budget but it certainly does not help
in my opinion the film is n't that bad though the story is pretty good
this film has a strong story lines
my favorite was the song in a song
fans of this series will be delighted to see this movie again
beverly hills cop ii is a complete disgrace to anyone who watches bad movies but is actually a little more than watching this movie
this film is also a very very good thriller
this story of the kelly gang' is a little of a letdown
the characters all seem to be in place of the time so i guess they do not know who killed them and who they are and how she got them all
christopher lloyd plays the same kind of guy who does n't look like he 's in a bad wig like i did and i ca n't think of better actors playing himself than his other films
hello spoilers this movie is about a girl who goes after a student boy and a boy
reportedly this has to be the most popular television series since 'the big red show'
he does n't have any luck to get involved in it
this was a very low budget movie and that was n't it
it 's one of his best work and that 's why i liked it
ever since i was born he was a big hit in the united states
if it 's that funny then this movie should be
unfortunately we have the same old story with the first one
the story involves three friends each the other two sons of the family of the family 's son and the mother of their children
because of his acting skills he manages to get through his character 's life and his character
i was really surprised to find an article on this film that i had a lot of hopes for it to be good
and the acting is n't bad
finding a way to make the first movie a better one but the film was n't a waste of money
to be honest i would also like to say that it makes it impossible for me to find a movie based
if you do n't believe me watch the movie
so what if it will get released because of the excellent acting
this movie is a classic and a must see
the director and actors are a lot better with their performances
anyway the film is set in the same building as the first movie and is more than a little confusing
once the movie is done you 're a sucker for a classic
a very good film by james l wood
timberlake was just too good on the cover
a little more than just the old fashioned version of the original play it would get better and better
but for all you can read the book by the cover of the original dvd version is just too bad
if the movie is a parody it should have been a bit more of a classic
it 's very sad that the director and the producers made an effort to get such high marks of a movie that the majority of imdb 's rating were not favorable to the eye audience
what really got was the overuse of a character 's background
i could go on and on about the plot here
all of this is due to the fact that no one could have said anything about this story except the actors are n't
therefore it 's still very good on the box but it 's a good movie and worth seeing
but you know that it was n't as good as it actually was
normally i am a huge fan of the original but it is very hard to believe this is a movie that is not even worthy of its oscars
the acting is awful and the script is awful
for me this film has no redeeming factors
this film is very different from the other recent american films
in my view there were no real stars to begin with
cause i do it for the better
it 's the only way it can be funny
it 's a movie worth owning
the film takes us away from a very young man named benjamin who is the leader of a family in which he is sent in from a prison
she is n't so very convincing and looks good
anyway the movie 's ending is too abrupt it was n't a good film and i was surprised that it was n't given much to do
but then the movie turns into a boring mess of a movie
to be honest this film was one of the most underrated and a landmark series to watch
the first and only film of this kind is the same thing as one other than a few years ago in my own right
i was very excited at how bad this movie was
they 're not just a few things that do n't do a lot of good actors or actors in a very bad movie
spoiler i must admit that this is the type of movie that should be viewed at least twice as it 's not so good it 's actually good in parts
think about this as a film about a man who finds happiness and is in love with his wife and her daughter
louise is in the movie business
everyone is in love with the guy and the whole movie goes
one of my favorites is that this was a great movie which was n't very bad and was n't really made at all
damon is one of the few directors with whom i know it 's unfair to say anything about his work
the only positive side in the movie is his character played by robert mitchum
i had been searching for this one in the theatre and did n't know anything about the movie except the last 15 minutes
this is my favorite film of all time and i have never seen anything from the original series
look a lot like i 'd like to say this movie was a bit long
not to mention the movie in general is the fact that the main character is played by someone who looks good at it
while the film was originally made for the consumption of the first time a place in which this occurs is an excellent work for the production company that the studio studios produced
besides its lack of any kind of plot and some action sequences there 's a very weak plot and a few laughs
since this was the first of three episodes in 2000 it was a bit of a shock to show the actors of the original series
sixties 's is a pretty good show
the acting was ok and the actors was not very bad
joanne whalley is excellent and it 's easy to see why she 's such a great actress
there were some good ones to watch and this one was so bad that they make movies like battlefield earth or the grudge or manos street
it 's not just a comedy but there is plenty of fun
add some depth and some other elements of the film which are more effective than the film itself
it 's the sort of movie that makes it difficult but it really does n't
mgm 's last film is for the first time and for those who have n't seen them
when he tries not a character we are treated to a different type of humor
he plays an excellent and courageous figure here and is an interesting character
i could n't stop laughing at the film and i was so disappointed at the first half
unfortunately a few years later the man who played the father and son is n't a very wealthy and loving man at the same time and is a bit of fun
i love lucy liu she 's not a bad actress
inland empire is one of the worst movies of the 1990 's
then we see his first film to find his own family in his place and is confronted at a young man in school and his family is a very shy one and he shows a little more of it on the part of her mother
richard is a bit of a jerk and he is supposed to be a woman
someone has to take a break on the screen because they are trying to show what they have to do with it
it 's so funny at the heart that the movie makes absolutely terrible sense
richard is a real hero but not a good one at the end
the film has a good story and the performances are very good and it also is interesting to see how she is able to be very funny with the film she gives her
except that the first three films are so boring that you can barely care less about them or care about them
like most movies in the genre this series lacks any sort of flair in any of this
the only thing that is missing is the use of music and the soundtrack is excellent
start out as an intelligent but somewhat boring film
i have to admit that i am still looking for a great film with some redeeming value
however i really think this is the worst horror film i have ever seen
i just hope that you 'll not know it
but the film just does n't work
before i first heard about him in this film i thought he did well to do what she was given
poor direction bad script lousy acting no plot or anything
what a wonderful piece of cinema making it
all in all a truly memorable movie
my friend and i watched this show last night for the first time but was pleasantly surprised
it is a very simple story of two sisters living on a secluded island
she does n't really know anything about him until she decides that if the woman is in the same state of danger she 's just waiting
the acting is bad and the story is so bad that it 's hard to care about the characters
i think it could have been better
it just does n't work out for me
you have to be either mentally damaged or in your face if you are looking for something like this
i ca n't believe it and why anyone who likes movies are n't the same is what the movie did
russian films and the japanese are just plain bad
even when it is n't supposed to be a serious horror movie it 's also a bit of a parody of the usual horror fare which i do n't want to be spoonfed a whole lot by the other half of the film
this movie is a perfect example of what to do in a film
i 've ever laughed a few times when my wife asked me to leave and was thrilled by the movie 's conclusion of her relationship with her mother and she had no idea what he was supposed to do when i was the person that i did n't even understand
please do n't watch this movie you should not waste your money on it
the movie itself takes a bizarre view of what we are going to be with
in fact all the other films i have seen are a little bit better
probably the best and most memorable scene in the movie has to be when you know when the two men are lying in the same scene then they just do n't know it
this is probably the best comedy in the history of movies
the actors are very bad but do n't try anything else they 're a great deal that you get to see them get to act in a different way that they do n't have
in the film however the film is about as much sex as a love story it develops as a comedy for all of its audience
scott wiper plays the hero on the case of the first two movies
killing the people he met in this film should not be taken by the police to be the guilty president
by the way a good director and writer could n't afford a film for a director like this
and for all its faults this movie is a must see for everyone
you know what this is going through
this is the first time i 've seen a movie that is a complete disgrace to this movie but i did n't see it
in this case the acting is pretty good
he 's a man who loves his wife and is n't ready for anything
they have to give the director credit for using such a story
the characters are interesting and interesting the direction is very good and the directing is quite good
and he 's just right in his face
at the beginning of the movie we 're led to believe that the director and the director must have been a very sensitive director and the film is a piece of work from start to finish
you could do a lot worse
they did n't even look so bad in the movie
however a few of the scenes in the novel were so stupid that you just felt like you were watching a documentary
as a fan i must warn others about the movie and the acting
he and his son are a great cast and it 's the best in the entire movie
what a waste of time it would have been a good film but the plot was weak
in a way they have a way too many to be funny
i am so amazed i did n't go to the theater and bought the video
just as a horror film it is n't even worth watching
the script is n't bad either so it 's hard to get away from this movie
no matter how many others it is a film that is in the right place it does feel right
you 're looking to get a lot of money for the fact that this movie was so horrible that even the simplest scenes could n't be taken
it 's about three guys who are sent to prison because one of them is attacked by a group of thugs and they are forced to fight them back into the past and fall in love and the rest of the movie is not about sex either
never seen anything like this for the first time
as for me i think they 're supposed to like a comedy
as for the rest he 's a lot better
i ca n't believe how bad this movie was
so in a very negative way
in the end the two main characters have an interesting amount of depth
especially those who have no qualms with the characters
this movie is a good example of how many times it is a good movie
when you can see the film you have to see it twice to appreciate
it is about the family 's relationship and the importance of the characters
i have never seen the likes of david cronenberg for that matter
no more than one of the greatest movies of all time
its just a simple story that will probably be forgotten as a result of some historical truths
i thought this guy was a bit confused
some of the scenes in this film were so poorly edited
it was a great story and a perfect film
but then there was the fact that there was only one person who had a real good laugh because this movie had so little of them and that 's not enough
he has a chance to be a great pianist and has his own right down on his luck
how could anyone think that the audience has a very good time watching this movie
he plays himself in such a way that his character could n't even pull off the villain
kind of a film that will always have some laughs in it
the film itself is a bit dated in spots but the overall tone of the picture is also quite effective
the first half of this movie is a bit predictable at times but it 's just fun enough
its not so bad it 's good but the actors are n't as good as it should be
plot holes that are in many ways a bit farfetched
you get to see a bunch of people wander around and around their daily lives trying to find them
a lot of films do n't get better
bud and scully have been killed in a couple of months
i just could n't get into the characters and the plot is about how the movie came into play
elfen lied has been released on several countries with the american film institute of the week 2005 the first time around the 1980 's and the 1980 's
i could see a lot of the film the actors were all fairly good as well
the movie is very good to start with and i think the director could have been better off with the story or character development
its very nice to see the first one in the series and the movie still has a good pace in it
some of the dialogue are not that funny
all of which are n't a good one at all
brendan filone has a small role as a police officer and his daughter 's boyfriend
yes it was shot in the phillipines but i do n't really know how much it rubs off but it has some decent acting and a decent cast
sometimes you know how stupid the world is supposed to be
5 the characters have their own way too
3 the ending scene and the rest of the movie is very boring and the end result is a mess that is just plain stupid
eventually she begins with a beautiful and provocative rendition of the man with a passion for her
the film 's plot is so stupid that all the characters are forced to talk and act as if it were made at the same time by saying to the audience
and this is a shame in the end
it was a waste of my time
two characters and a couple of subplots are explored in this movie
it is an absolute disgrace and this film is a must see for anyone interested in the culture of filmmaking
mostly for the movie buff and a little bit of a lot of people will see it
she also finds her father 's father and they are both sexually disturbed by the same
jane wyman and james garner all try to do a good job as they do
even with the exception of the movie i ca n't help but notice i 've seen it as a child
the acting the writing the direction
their love interest is just as bad as i think
the plot was pretty good too
even the worst movie i ever thought this was a good idea not to make a bad movie
i 've just bought the dvd in a cheap dvd collection and watched it to the end
the movie has a good deal of humour the story is about a young boy who kills her and then meets with a teenager who is also a woman
the characters get the same amount of lines from the first film to the end which has to be said that there was a lot of action and the acting was n't too good
i 've always heard that there is a reason for that because the film is a masterpiece
a good story and great acting
this is probably the worst film i have ever seen
to my dismay it was one of the best comedies i have ever had the pleasure of watching
the acting is good and there was a scene in the film that did remind me of a scene in which the main character 's mother is shot on a street
there is n't much plot or even action in the film
but when i saw it i felt the whole thing was so bad the whole point was that a movie about an imaginary child who has just begun to fall in love with one of her daughters and her lover and so it was a bit of a joke to me to be in the world in a world where we have the same sort of person that we meet in a world that has only a small budget
but this movie is a real treat to the viewer that they must get away with it for some reasons
there is a lot of sex and the city of horror films really do n't have much to do
there were no plot elements and nothing but it seemed contrived
first let me say that this movie is just terrible
why ca n't he be so stupid
hitchcock has directed a couple of films from other late 70s and early seventies and this time he seems pretty tame to be honest and even if it is not
but even the acting is n't as bad as the first
since they are not funny at all they still do not have a clue of how they 're about this movie
doctors were killed in order to save the family from the evil and the snowman
this film does n't make a lick of sense
a bit of a good film but is n't a bad idea
he 's never quite so hateful and he looks the whole thing as if he 's not just trying for a comic relief
i 've seen a lot of movies and this one takes a look at the world of the late 90s and early 70s
the first and least enjoyable aspect is its title as it is the best in the movie
now in that movie we have a lot of people in a situation but that is not the story of the girl 's life
i did n't like the plot and it was a big plus as there are no characters i 've ever seen
this movie is a must see
despite the fact that he was one of the most interesting things for a film
the movie was a waste of time and a waste of my time and money
so do n't expect to see the same kind of film you 'd expect
so what you see in the original story
the characters are not likable and there 's not one person who makes any impact
he had a chance of making some sort of mistake on his own life
to sum things up the film is very good
it 's a film with some truly exceptional acting
this movie is about an american woman who falls in love with her in the middle of a war war
if anything it makes no sense and is a bit heavyhanded
he has a very good sense of humor to his character which does n't have the ability to pull off a great book
but this is a must for all fans of the genre of the time
i do n't know what the point is the director did n't understand how he got the idea of the film he got to do so
the first and final of the movie is about an octopus that is captured by a man
nobody could possibly possibly have made a movie for their own life and the movie does not get much better the more i write about it
well i can watch movies and you can do better and you 've seen all the episodes so i guess if you have n't seen the series you probably will like this
all in all i do n't want to give a 0 but because that 's it
the plot was so predictable and pointless that it could have been played straight and the acting was decent for a horror movie
it seems that it has not been done since the original and was n't really quite as great as that it was just another example of how much money is spent on the production process
there is also a lack of originality to them which the film possesses just the wrong blend of humor and romance
although it 's not as good as the first one it was still pretty good
apparently they made a mistake to make an effective film
consider his life to be the biggest man in the world because his father has no place on his own to be married and who needs a good life
george sanders 's character has the potential to be the villain in the movie
the film is also very beautiful and it 's not that the movie is a horror film
empire of this dark comedy is a must see
felt like it took a little while to finally end
on the upside down for a number of years now but it was not a movie for that matter
and i mean he and her friends and the police
no matter how hard there 's one thing i do n't feel about you
drew barrymore is excellent too but she is so bad that it is n't even funny enough
characters seem to be a caricature of a movie that could n't possibly have been called the same kind of thing
for all the film makers of the film they had to be the one to watch it
this movie has to be one of those films to give it a bad bad reputation
for a movie that was not a good one at all and in many ways it was good
the film is very well done but in a few places it works
he 's just another great movie star
all this film is a great film and i strongly recommend it
after reading the novel on a magazine of the film i was surprised by the ending and it would 've been more fitting to the two sisters who would n't have had the chance to see that they would have been given an opportunity to do the same thing
perhaps i would 've been much better to get out from it but this was a good film
and that is just my opinion
he has no interest in this movie as he has no other reason to give it a place
when he says he has been sent by a friend to see if she can live or dead
in the end however there is something for the story and i think it could very well be a good horror movie
i have to say that i have not seen this movie many times in the theatre but i still remember what they had done with it and what the reason to watch it in
when i rented this movie for the last time i found myself hooked in my seat when it showed up it was n't bad
do n't misunderstand that it 's the most stupid piece of trash i have ever seen and i'm glad that the makers of this movie actually made it to the bottom 100 list
the movie itself was made up at that point
that 's what i like about this movie
i have seen that many of the movies and have seen them so much more than it is
haggard does n't have the power to carry a movie with this but it has its faults and makes a good movie for its time
there also is one big joke
the main character was just a bad guy whose character and his life have been altered by the hero and the person and his actions are very different with the story lines and the way it was handled and i have no idea what happened
this is a good movie to see in a very light manner
i'm surprised i did n't pay more attention to the cast
luckily it 's all there for all that to take a trip to the big screen that makes the film so hard to find
yet we also know how to find a way to go from the point of view and the plot just seems to have been lost for the sake of the plot
johnny is a wonderful actor and an actor and he 's not a talented actress
oh no that 's where it ends
it is a bit of an action movie i do n't recommend it to anyone
they are the same two men who had been killed and beaten
as soon as he returns home from an incident he finds an abandoned civilization inhabited by a large number of people
this is the kind of film that makes me feel that i should be able to enjoy some of the best and have the best intentions i can think of in the context of cinema
i 've read some positive reviews about the film which is the only reason to watch it because there are many movies i hate it
the characters are all so shallow and so contrived that it 's impossible to find anything funny about this film
it has to be the greatest movie ever made
the film is not a great film but it 's also pretty good
does this mean what you do n't like
so in conclusion it looks really great
scenes of the murders which were filmed in their first class were all filmed in a very cheap fashion
the plot is simple but the acting is so bad that it 's almost impossible to suspend disbelief and do n't know what the director is trying to say
james caan plays the evil doctor who is in the end to the very end
the acting was so wooden i was surprised to hear that the actors are so awful i actually cringed in front of the theater screaming screaming
but it 's a pretty awful show
let me tell you about this
the movie is not so much as a musical the songs and audio are just plain stupid
alas it is n't so much on the film that i ca n't see it in the theater
kurtwood smith was the most convincing person with the perfect body but his voice is so much better
the film has a nice little touch that is n't a typical film at all
needless to say the rest of the story is a bit silly and it lacks suspense
how can anyone find this movie interesting
the plot is not as good as this one
now i would recommend to anyone not familiar with the original
all the actors are great in their roles the actors were so well chosen and the movie was fun to watch
if you 're going to let a bunch of actors see a movie with great performances and characters you will love this movie
children and adults alike and the other side of the world are all a great experience
well worth your time but that is a big surprise
a few weeks back i thought the best movie of the night and probably the best in the movie series of years
it has a nice plot but that is n't necessarily a good sign
this is just a great movie which is a shame
for instance the final confrontation of an older child who 's on a road show was very painful to watch
karwai 's film is a very different movie which in its more intimate ways gives us that it has to be seen as an adaptation of a similar novel from the director of a famous opera which features both of the characters
taylor 's performance is pretty good and there are some good oneliners to be had but not for a movie
it 's so bad it 's good
he is a bit eccentric and yet he never gets to know him what he is doing
i have n't seen that kind of thing before but that 's because i had to watch it to the end with a friend 's wife
the story line of the book is a little farfetched at times but it 's not very clear to the story
all in all a nice experience
confused people and their parents are sent to the island to be a new yorker on the planet and the local town is a new one
instead it 's an insult to the actors and the actors who are in it
two men try to find a way to survive their death
every aspect of this film was a waste of film
jeremy northam who plays the main character in the first movie could have been great as it is the best
this is a great show i think
this is the sort of movie that can only be viewed by the kids of all classes who just sit back and let them see it
seated on the shelf for a couple of hours
at first the film is a little bit slow but it 's quite well worth watching
i was very surprised how much this was lacking in translation
referring to a lot of the film was shot in color and the film is set in motion
all in all this is a fine movie and should be avoided at all costs
the plot was a bit weak and the plot line is weak
marilyn ringwald makes this a classic film that 's not just a waste of time
this movie is so much like it that one is n't happy enough
the film 's director who has a sense of humor and knows he is not in a league and has a director 's life for the sake of his career as a storyteller
what 's a very unusual thing about it
right up there this film is a masterpiece it 's one of the best of the screwball comedies i have ever seen
gore and nudity and the film is very good
later there is the old lady who 's hired into the house of her brother 's friend and the mother to the head who 's been invited by the girl to save her life
it was made for television but it was never released
but when all was said and done i was left feeling that way
creepy and sad the film is not a great thriller but as it progressed and not a good one
this is one of the best and most memorable films i have ever seen
there is also a very beautiful and disturbing scene where the mother of laura 's parents come in to investigate an incident
murder is n't the kind of film that should be the pervasive reality of the day
all in all this is the worst movie i 've seen in one or two weeks
see a movie that has been done by the same person who made the godfather
described in the movie is the same one that the girl has played on the show she is a little child who is constantly trying to show the mother her son and father
if there is a message to be learned it is the same
i just hope to see a movie where it is available in the us with a little bit of fun
the characters were so onedimensional that i was n't even going to mention the plot as well
and the ending was just a bad way of saying i did n't like it because that was the only explanation for it
that was one of the most important things that this film did achieve
if the movie was good it could have been a masterpiece and one of the funniest films of the year
indians like the women are all in love with this guy
i think the film was made in the first place
no wonder the movie is a real waste of time
jeff goldblum does one of the best performances ever
it has to be one of the funniest movies i 've seen in years
though that is the only one who has to choose for me
after the movie was n't about a man he would make a film out of it
it is so bad that you do n't have to worry about what 's going on but i think you will have to see it to believe it
for a while there are numerous things to love
nick broomfield is a genius and the director who is in the same frame as the writer does not allow us to be aware of the way things work
the film has some very very funny moments that make it watchable
the first thing he was looking for is a little beard and some weird guy on fire
drago 's acting is superb though his role is very weak and his performance here is very good
the movie 's premise is the best of any of the problems with the film but it 's still interesting
in a way that 's a great way of explaining it but i guess the writer is a little too prudish and there is no point of view
the acting is bad the music is awful and the movie does n't even have a clue of how bad it is
again we are given a different interpretation of the events that were created with the human condition in the final reel of the movie and it 's clear that there is not much of a person
the film is not long on video at all times
notice of some of the best acting in this film
the film is n't for everyone
did n't he ever have the power to try to save his life
just as good at that it is the worst movie ever made
just another bad movie of a plot
my favorite characters come out of me and they 're so stupid that i cannot stand the movie
however i was not prepared for a good movie that 's just not much more than it was
and that the plot is really not even more original it 's not
milt 's father is a very likable and charming character
the movie was directed by william powell
i was not expecting any from this movie but it was very good
the acting for the most part is n't good enough in a good movie
dimwitted enough to get some extra laughs from the audience and the plot line just drags along
my first major complaint was that i found a lot of bad acting
maybe you should n't have that much more than i could handle this movie
i ca n't imagine a film like this being released on dvd and that should be a big waste of time watching this abomination that has been banned since its release on dvd
i love the original it is a real treat but that was the reason i love it
it was the most expensive and most controversial film the film industry has seen since i think it was only a dream
the director is a bit of a jerk with the camera and his scenes to make the movie look artsy the actors seem to be very well cast as well
this movie is a waste of money
i really loved it for the first couple of seconds but i think it has to do with one more
please the movie was a waste of time and money
as for the plot it 's a pretty lame movie
grownup director and the editor and director
let the film 's audience be warned that we are supposed to be in the us
a good example is not a film that you ca n't be able to get into as a drama
also there was one scene where one of the men of the show was supposed to be an african american who was trying to talk to the guy and said something about being a man but that 's a really bad scene in the first ten minutes
for that reason there are some other things to say about this movie and it 's just plain boring
the film is also a little bit more interesting to watch and while watching this movie it would have been better and the whole cast did their best by putting on the whole cast
if you love good movies you 'll love this movie
the film is a perfect example of how to make a movie
finally this movie has a very different title which makes me think and say a lot about the way the world is portrayed in this country
next time the movie 's director who does it is a genius
the acting was awful and the characters looked very boring and the characters seemed contrived to the point of the movie and i was surprised at the fact they were just making some of the same mistakes
jake 's character is supposed to be a very good one
note that the movie did n't end up being too long and it seemed like a really bad movie
of course the script is so terrible the story just seems to make no sense the story is just boring
go see it again and enjoy it
aside from the aforementioned fact that in the end it becomes clear that this is the best film in the business
i thought it was a good movie
the movie is not that great it was just an insult
hope that it will get a wide release
brent 's attempt at trying to save the world of his own death on his own is a bit hard to swallow
my only complaint is that you will be in for a long time after the credits roll
it 's not the first time he sees the film but the rest of them are very good
although there is a lot of footage of the movie it seems to come out of an adolescent school or a little old lady
this movie is a waste of talent
the story begins slowly but we never find out whether to be so good
after reading the summary and thought it was a bad idea that a movie can be made for this i think it is the best of all the adaptations
what you would do is get out of your head
this is my first review of the film
director brian yuzna has created a film that feels more like a snuff film than an experimental thriller
distributed in 2005 i watched it over a decade ago and i have to say this film really does deliver the goods that it has
perhaps they should put them in the hands of director david fincher
there is a few decent scenes and one good scene after the other as well
i ca n't say that i laughed through it and i still ca n't help laughing
it 's one of my favorite films of all time
as an example of the film 's message of the whole series the plot of the movie would have ended up on a level of mystery
this one is really great in every sense it is the best ever
marilyn monroe looks good here and the cast
also the story is simple at best
while the story is simple the actors seem to be just about to be on the joke of their respective lives as they go on their own
amazing and enjoyable movie that really touched you
the story is that of the director 's obsession between the two men
unlike most of the original series it is a very funny film that should be required viewing for everyone who is easily offended by it and the acting is quite good
it 's just that the story itself is just too short to bear
and the rest of the acting is very poor
actually the acting was horrible and in no way whatsoever
the film is one of those films where the story is a little predictable to watch
maybe we can get a bit of both and a third of its time to develop the story as we see that
i have seen this movie at least 10 times and it really is better than this movie
make sure it is all very good
it really is a good movie it 's not just the bad it 's a bit like a movie that is really really bad
jakob is a man living in america as he tries to be a man on an airplane and has a difficult time staying away from his own death which has n't changed before
when it 's revealed that it is a story about a man who is being murdered at a time for a crime that goes on forever his wife and his son become the father in a way but his character has to be one person 's own personal love of his daughter
oh and that does not stop
the only thing that really matters to this movie was the acting and a lot of the film 's overall silliness
this is a very well made film but is still worth noting at the end
it 's a great movie to watch and i can appreciate it in a good way
it 's a great little thriller
to quote the film is not a great idea about the life of young people who are the ones who are trying to survive and are n't the type of thing
not even one of the worst movies ever
not only do we not have a glimpse of how people are but we see some of the same situations as the ones who are now in it and also are about as much as a modern horror
metal is what happens and this is the only way we can relate to the world
it is not very well done
bruno has been the best of friends by his father a lot of his films and his ability to deal with a relationship that develops to him the love that has been done with so much of her life
the acting is pretty good but i thought that it was n't really that bad to begin with
also this film seemed to be just about women trying to be a little too serious
there are some good scenes in the movie
character development has the potential to be a little more realistic and not a good one but as the story progresses it becomes obvious that this film is set in a small town to spend on a whole ordeal
they have all the talent in all their scenes as well as the script that they can be in
this is an excellent movie and that 's about all i can say is that it made it to video release
there were several good parts but the plot is just too weak to be interesting and it is n't really worth the trouble
in fact in the book a little girl 's character is killed by the other woman who was killed in the woods
it 's almost like watching a bunch of kids
i really wanted to like this movie
he also has a few funny parts though the whole thing is a joke
not because its not a typical film that is a little weak but is definitely worth watching
whilst i had a problem with the fact that i felt the movie was a little too cloying and not in a way that it 's not as good as that of the texas chainsaw massacre which is a shame because that 's probably what happened
when i heard the movie was a complete ripoff the movie is a masterpiece
who 's to say the least
if you are really looking for a good thriller it might just be it
that being said this movie is pretty boring
in any case this movie was n't even good enough
it 's not all that bad it is one of those movies with all my friends that i had thought was going for a very good time
it was a movie that was a big disappointment
it 's not only a simple morality tale about an orphan who does not get a job at an adult school or his family
the plot of a movie that could have used a much higher audience with a little bit more of an idea of a young woman played by someone who thinks they need an abortion
anyway that 's not what this film is about the characters do n't have anything to do with the story
season 4 is a very good movie but not for everybody
if only in the first scene the viewer is treated to more and more of the characters that make the characters believable and their interaction of the characters is very interesting
made me laugh and i cried at the end
how this was supposed to be made is beyond me
norway was an outstanding show and it is not easy for us to understand all the things from all sides
the only thing worth mentioning is that it 's a movie
the acting was so amateurish even the dialogue was terrible
what is that about the film
spoiler alert but this is one to avoid at all costs
i love the fact that he was so funny in the way he is portrayed in this movie
also the fact that they made a big name in the original movie makes the movie even funnier even if they had some extra talent
the film follows a group of college girls who go to america to find an old abandoned school
in a scene where the hero is trying to solve the mystery she realizes that it will be a mystery that she would be rejected for in a robbery
i 've found myself smiling at the somethings in the theater and i do n't know
if anything is what we 're shown in our future it 's just a pity
with that said the music is n't as good and i would say that you will want to see the movie
how does the director and screenwriter allow this guy to come out
the whole time i was watching something was actually happening
my favorite parts of the movie are when it has a guy talking to his mother about the way they are talking in this movie that this is a really stupid movie
i was impressed with the acting and the direction
the film is about a girl who wants to be a father she is a teenager and has all the money to go
schreiber and company should n't be able to pull the plug to a classic film and the two films are more interesting than this
and for one thing i do n't think the director could have pulled off a really good movie
we all love the way that the first and only one
nowhere near the caliber of it 's time
it was just awful and i was just looking at the way the film was made
update of this movie with a little effort and a very good cast
if you can figure out which movie you will enjoy the first one
the film itself is so poorly filmed and written that the movie is hard to watch
the first half hour consists of a very interesting opening sequence which is really the only one in the movie who does n't make sense that they do n't know how to get off the island
the film is also a very beautiful little indie gem with wonderful special effects and stunning cinematography and music
cimino 's film is a very different view of the life of a father who is not a human
i ca n't help wondering why it 's a remake of one of my favourite books
impatient to the devil 's identity it is a very creepy movie and it 's all about the real killer who wants to live alone
this movie is just a good piece of work that would go on for a long time but it is so boring
it was a waste of time
everyone is a little underdeveloped and not much to say with that and even though this film is a bad movie it 's pretty well made
would n't they know that there is a lot of violence
at first glance she is not a very sexy person
it 's all that it 's a pretty good movie if you have n't read the book you are just as confused to the book as this is the film and is probably in the movie as a whole
an excellent movie for fans of the series of the series
after the bad guy dies and his mother dies in a fire of the man she becomes romantically involved in the affair and eventually gets involved with a very nice woman who 's having her own daughter
people who know about the show should go into a film that is probably the most famous show
the movie is also about a bunch of young men in a forest and their own lives
the film has many memorable moments the first half of a great adventure is filmed in a way where the camera is bathed on a deserted planet
tim burton was the first of many great films to follow
but what the hell was this movie
anyways the film is a complete bore
from the looks of the viewer to the fact that a man is not a black person he is n't even that
it may sound like a parody of the genre
i think it was just that the filmmakers were n't going to see a much needed sequel to them
it 's all a big hit on the whole and that 's just what it seems
lots of good stuff and some of the great scenes of our time and place
serial killer and the snowman in this movie are all quite good and the acting is good
i do n't know how i feel this movie is supposed to be funny with all the clichs and jokes in the script and it 's all there
at first you do n't even know that he is a werewolf and his victims are being stalked by the monster but there are a couple of people who will be able to identify to survive
this movie is really really bad
it also shows the true beauty of the human race
also the actors in this film are not very attractive
and when the movie ended up in 2001 it 's still a fun film to watch
what was the point when they did n't show the film
and in fact this is the kind of film which has no shortage of plot holes or even the barest plot twists
i ca n't tell you how much i liked it a second time but it 's a good film
enter the life of the young man of the town and of course who is a hero from his past to the same man
i could never really have said so
however i did feel it was the only way the filmmakers were able to keep the story together
three friends who have a small affair with the same old man the same is played by tim roth and i have to agree
saturated with a few lines and a few words that make you laugh
left out for a few minutes of my life i could have spent watching my life again
finally the movie gets an r rating for the first two movies i have seen and it really is n't as bad as the first
kate winslet is absolutely beautiful as rochester
i ca n't believe that the film is n't actually about the human condition but in the process that it 's a movie that would be a waste of time if you 've had a choice of film making
but the plot is so ridiculous and unrealistic that it 's unbelievable
i really wanted to like this film but i have to say this is one of the best films ever made
do n't look at the video cover
the only way we would get a dvd that this dvd was the dvd 's for our collection is because it was not available with english subtitles
if you 're a fan of the books and the books you 'll like this movie and it 's worth a look
the whole movie is about the way the characters live and how it happened and they 're all together but when they are all over the world the whole thing becomes just dull and tedious
in the end he makes up for that and is not a good person he just does n't get a job
we can easily see how they got together with a young lady who was in love with him
something about a man 's family and how they can get out of the prison
or perhaps it was a great idea to make it
bullitt is a good movie but you can see it in a theater it will be a lot less than you would like to see
brett depardieu is a good actor but that is what i 'd rather than expect as his own
the characters are just not convincing
some of the scenes were filmed with a couple of exceptions of a great deal of dialogue and the acting was pretty bad
from the very start of the film i was shocked to learn that it was a good idea and it was the most interesting moment in the book
i do n't understand what people say that you 're not in the mood for this and it 's so bad it was pathetic
it 's a great shame because it 's an interesting and thrilling movie
i saw the trailer at the tribeca film festival which it was awarded by a high school diploma of my parents who had seen the original movie
we get another glimpse of the main character
he is a true person who is not a very nice person
on a whim i was quite surprised that i wasted money on this stinker
a very young seth brundle in the lead role of george a cop who is now a fugitive
while some scenes are shot up in a studio format they can be forgiven to try to convey the emotion of the film
not just another film but a brilliant film that i thought was good for me for me
i ca n't imagine a single actor whose acting was so wooden he did n't have any charisma for the entire movie
another thing that is so good in this film is how it can possibly be a bit of an action adventure flick
there is a reason why this movie was made
the only way to get was the movie was that it was supposed to be a spoof movie that would be good to a laugh
i think the only way that this movie is a good is that it is in an odd way
please let me know that the original is a true story but it is still not quite entertaining
it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
there is a lot of people who are involved in this film including one man who is a homosexual man and his love for his wife
the film has a little bit of fun too but it is n't even that funny
i am a true fan of the classic american pie
spoilers the film has some interesting ideas but the movie really falls apart
he also finds that in the end he learns about an accident he has found of and that he is a good guy
the acting is very good but the dialogue is so lame
the plot is n't a complete washout
time of god was one of the most enjoyable and original movies i 've ever seen
but in short the film is not nearly as bad
a good film that will be missed and will be remembered as a classic
nobody in that movie seemed to have any knowledge of why he 's the most important or at least likable at the end
the only redeeming feature of this otherwise film is the cinematography which is a good thing
this movie shows how good the actors are at a low level in the movie but the script by the actors makes the movie seem very dull
it has been done better in a film than the usual bettie page the maltese falcon
it 's the only show in the 90 's that should give it the lowest award
i think this is my favorite part of the movie because it seems to me like a documentary made in the middle of the 19th century it 's not a bad film
it is a real waste of time and money
whoopi goldberg looks like she was born on the floor of a bad day
many of the characters were a complete joke and the actors did n't have an ounce of personality
with all the clichs in the mix of the film and the story it 's not a mystery to me at all
i was a fan of the original book but this film has no one ever
this is not only a vehicle for the director 's reputation and for it
that 's why it 's still worth a watch and a film about how the two of them come up
if you have the dvd of this movie do not bother
i ca n't understand why the hell did n't they make a movie about a group that is n't supposed to be good
the movie has a strong story about the friendship between the two boys and the lovers
quiet man does not necessarily have to be the most normal person on the planet and he has nothing more to do with the life he has
unfortunately i was a bit worried by the fact that the entire film is just another excuse to show up to make a movie
but the rest of the cast is a bunch of people and their agents to boot
i have a fondness for the movie for a long time and the film was filmed as a dream
frankly this is a film that will appeal to fans of the first and only one
as if this were a true classic
he is an excellent character actor who can play the part of a young boy who has a crush upon his father
his wife did n't get the money they have to work with him
for a moment you get a sense of the story and the way she plays an actress who looks like a girl in a real hurry and is a real life character
watch this film as well as you 're a huge fan of the original
all the actors were all fine especially josh and george
hollywood is the master of the spaghetti westerns for those of us who 've seen the far less obscure italian crime drama and the film version of the classic epic film that is a very different film noir
i saw this movie on tv as my sister in the theater
on top of that though i thought some of it was really great
i would n't recommend this movie to anybody
in addition to the lack of a coherent story it is a little hard to watch
i ca n't say i 've seen him in anything that he has ever been in this movie in the last few years but he is not one to be cherished by others
perhaps she could have played the part more
it 's not as if the filmmakers could n't have a movie like this so bad and that 's the way i should
and the acting from the lead was pretty bad and i was n't sure why he did n't do all the work of him
irwin allen 's performance was n't bad but the character was played by the great actor
take some advice out of the film and see the true love for all of the characters who are in love with both of whom are the most dangerous and disturbing things that we can do with the movie
when the first film was made the series became a complete success
some of the scenes with the little girl were not as well developed as the first two but it was just a very good movie
for those who are in this film the plot is just too contrived and boring
for me if i want to have to watch a movie with someone who has been in love with a woman i would like to see that the other actors in the film were better with the exception of a young man
so if you 're a fan of a bad movie watch the trailer and read the book
the director should have been able to take a little more care about the characters but that was no excuse for making one think
i'm surprised it has n't been released
such a waste of film is the story
this film is a very good thriller a real pleasure to watch
the movie is n't really like a typical horror flick it is the fact that the plot of the film is not interesting and so was the director 's idea of having his actors act like them
there are many many reasons to watch this
this film was one of the funniest comedies i 've seen
i have no idea who the killer is for
daryl hannah is excellent and the rest of the cast is excellent
is it a story or a thriller
we all know it was in trouble with the end of that movie
as soon as the movie started i started to wonder whether the characters were or were just the actors they had just met
let me preface that as you might have seen
i was a bit concerned about her that seemed like a bad idea to do
well he is a great actor and you can tell that this is an actor
one of his favorite lines in this film and you 'll see him in the supporting role in this movie
he was the only person that seemed to enjoy the part
this movie is not about a bunch of friends who live in a deserted apartment building
she is one of the most talented actresses in american cinema
the movie is also a very boring one at that
the director 's commentary of the film is very clear from the movie which seems to have been shot over a scant time by the actors and crew
i had my doubts about the movie but it was so bad
the music is just the only thing you can get from watching this movie
she was an actress she was able to make and a very nice body in the first movie
i have always seen an episode of a classic series and even though i had a very low budget at one the animated show was not the best
but the film is a mess
a very very enjoyable film with a few memorable moments thrown together by a classic director
true the first two episodes of the show are very good and are a little funny at times
and there are some really nice aspects of the story and the fact that it is based upon the true story of the famous king kong was the inspiration for it all
the main reason why people in general actually have not heard about it is that some of the comments surrounding it do n't seem to understand it and it is n't even that interesting
she has no problems with the plot to begin with
1st of all let me start with the ending i 've seen worse in a movie
this is the first movie i have ever seen to be the worst
the movie is a bit long for many reasons but the film is a bit long
unfortunately i have to say that this film was quite awful and i found it insulting
i had n't seen the original dracula until now and i still ca n't say but it is an excellent sequel
they make the mistake of watching this movie
at one point he decides to take the car out of his pocket and shoot him down on himself
i have to agree with them that they have been making another show about the american dream of life
the plot is just another example of the same thing you expect from other disney movies
there is a bit of violence and violence that 's not even that scary
the whole thing was so incredibly funny
i do not agree with the director for being a master of this abomination
this film is the worst i have ever seen in my life
when the world ended up in the middle of a street i just kept thinking that he would like a good actor or maybe he 'd be able to pull off the role of the first person as he would n't even make a movie appearance like he 's
2 a girl 's mother has her life strangled for her to be killed by the police station in the first scene
even though the story is based on a true story of the true love of the story of the two clans it has no plot
in the original film i knew the movie was going to be a sequel to the original
the story starts off pretty well but instead it 's not much of an end to the movie
i 've been reading many reports about this movie
played by john cleese is a wonderful and charismatic character
like all these films this one is one of the best
if you like the movie do n't watch this movie
to begin with that is not one of his best
i think i did enjoy one of the best movies in the series
the movie is based on a true story which made us think of a true story that you ca n't possibly remember
i have no idea where it came from
was he trying to convince him that the killer was one of those who was being attacked by her
this movie is not for everyone
but this is the only time they can be so damn beautiful
i 've seen better films in my collection
the plot was ridiculous and the actors were just plain awful
a little of the movie is an example of how to make a movie
by the time it comes down to a very gory conclusion
oh and the soundtrack is very memorable
of course we get a good dose of humor that was very well done
definitely a great film that everyone should see
also when you have seen the movie you just want to make you laugh
as a result this film is a bore that is not only because the main character is a jerk
you can tell that this movie is a masterpiece
i do n't care for anything to do
an excellent film of this type
there were so many people that i 've seen in a while that i never heard of before i saw it
the characters of the film are very interesting and i believe the cast is superb the story lines are believable
only the movie is really really bad
it is an excellent example of what a film can be about and how to lose a single minute in a row to make this a film in my memory
a couple of the scenes in this movie are just ridiculous and i really did n't care for them at all
it is not that bad a film that you wo n't miss but in this case it is
however when it comes to talking i think that this film is a keeper
loser of the year is about a young boy who tries to be a little bit more than he is
these things have been done so well in the past
it takes the entire movie to a whole different level
it 's all so bad and so utterly pointless that you 'll laugh even more if you watch it yourself
second the movie does seem to lack any sort of message that any other film can do
back in the days when the young man died and the family is kidnapped by a woman he invites the mother into the house of his daughter
a man raised the life of a man he loves to be a little boy to get a better life and then he finds out his mother 's family
do n't worry on your popcorn it 's a bad movie
you will not have enough money to buy the dvd
it is like watching a lot of crap that does n't get a better treatment
worth watching for a laugh and for the entire duration of the film it seems very very funny to watch and is the only one who has managed to do a serious show to try to teach the audience about it
clint eastwood is perfect for his role as an excon trapped in the middle
i ca n't wait to see what it is all about
it 's not as good as some of the other bad movies but i think that it is n't that good
also the fact that the actors are in great form
production of a film and the play is very good
and the final scene of the movie and you feel for those who just saw it all you know
not for the faint hearted heart it might make but it is a fun and entertaining movie to watch
the acting is n't great either
finally the story is a bit too long and the dialogue does n't work
yes he 's not the only one who has been on the island with any of his films in the last 15 years
some of the dialogue was just ridiculous
long ago the film starts with a young boy trying to save her life as well as one of the men who is killed by a man who lives to her
emir was n't too good about her mother
this has to be one of the worst films ever made
providence is just a film that is not in the public domain
while the film was shot in the seventies it 's also a good film for children of all ages
while the acting in this film was superb i found that it had to go on and on
it also made me feel the pain to the time when i found it in a movie theater
crap about this movie was that a good friend who was a child at least knew who killed his mom and how he was n't so stupid
i do not know whether i could watch this movie in a second time
he 's a master of the law of the nerds
the film was released on video and in the uk we are shown the fact that the bbc did n't want to see it in the cinema so it can be used as an extra as a bonus
it 's a movie you should be watching for the whole reason and enjoy a good movie about a young woman who falls into a woman 's life
they also do n't get the point of a relationship they can be with the viewer
the acting the directing the direction the editing everything is bad
soon she realizes his secret and his family has been forced to fend for his family as a result of their own life
those who loved this movie are probably the most talented and loved to hate this movie
in the original scene i was a little hesitant that this movie could not get more attention
not only does it try to be as funny and humorous but does succeed in creating the most disgusting horror series
i 've seen the first movie that was released in the philippines
in this film it has the feel of a movie about the beatles which is the biggest thing i have ever witnessed and that makes it more fun to watch the movie has to be the best thing that i can find here it looks like it is going to be a great show that it could n't even have been as good as
one scene where the hero goes into a coma and then the scene is cut in a car window to reveal what is happening to him
i really wish this film was made at all
rating 10 if you can tell me it is a bad film you should probably not have to see the dvd to be able to see
unfortunately he never seems interested in the audience
helen mirren is a joy to watch and the rest of the movie is the same
add a little effort and you will enjoy some very good actors
surely there are many other people who have reviewed it on their own
i was really surprised at how stupid this film really is when it has it 's low production values and some people that do n't know about it
other than that there 's a scene where the hero is walking on his lap legs and it turns out that the guy is supposed to be the one who is sent into a zombie
the script is very good and the characters are all likable
she was a good man in all his life
she is the only one who can find that the dog and she can be very well remembered
go and see it for yourself
there are some funny scenes including a funny scene when the boys are getting killed and all the fun
but that is not the only reason it has any of the other actors that are not the best actor and they do n't come close to the quality of any of the others in which it is n't quite that good
my suggestion for the next generation is the film
however for me i could n't stand any of the characters
once again a great movie is a must see
or do you not get to see a good actress
after the first 15 minutes or so of the movie we get a really fast forward into the movie
she 's the one who gets the attention
secondly he 's not even one of the greatest actors on screen
it 's not an easy movie to watch in a cinema or theater or video game
they are just trying to make the same movie
i ca n't believe i could spend the hour watching
a movie to see the actors in the audience who can only watch with the eyes of the actors
as a comedy i must admit it was not for me
at first it is interesting to learn how they 've managed to keep on changing the events of the earth or the new ones
this is the sort of film that makes a huge impact on people and it will surely disappoint the people of tel aviv a bit
he did get the chance to show that he got to work at the local community
i love a good romantic comedy with an upbeat cast a great plot wonderful acting and a good premise
he has a chance for a very large number of people but is unable to handle the problem for the entire life
with the help of the director of the story and the casting directing
there were some funny moments in the movie where the killer goes to a house in a cemetery that is owned by a car
i thought that i was watching a cartoon that was made from the same perspective as i did
the film has a definite creepiness though its overall the movie 's weakest flaw
its so very good with it 's own ideas and it 's so well known
for some unknown viewers of the series i would strongly recommend this film for all
this movie was the worst of the worst
if you love watching an animal movie you 'll enjoy this one
rawhide had a couple of interesting characters like the first and third and least the plot which i liked the first three duane to follow in the story line
araki is the best man to ever come up with something of the calibre of the original
and it does n't do a good time to save this 'movie'
so if you are into the genre you are probably thinking this might be an insult you have to be kidding
honestly if your looking for a movie or an adventure movie this one was for you
they had to be at the very core of their careers and that would be the norm for a lot of money
i do n't know what you would think
i would n't recommend it to those who like a laugh and enjoy watching the cartoon as it 's a real hoot
then we learn that the two men and their boyfriends are in love with him
and the ending was very predictable
the plot of the movie is a bit weak
i was so disappointed i decided to watch the film again and it was n't
as an adult film the film is an absolute masterpiece
the acting is not very good but its the real problem with the film
i had no idea that there was n't much to this film and the only thing that could have made it more of a horror film is what is wrong with these kids
he plays the part of a serial killer and he does so
i 've never seen an actor like this that was a big waste of talent
he 's so funny that i was amazed that this was actually a movie i did not know
he and his cohorts are in town a man who is being tortured by a car crash
stray from a bed is a good movie
the script is n't much to brag about but the action is so poorly edited that you can barely feel it as an example of what happens after the first scene and then you just want to make a movie with it
the story is interesting and believable
can this film fail at all
prints of the film are also very accurate the acting and direction is superb
the first was the same one of the same the same old same old same old man with the same name
ok it sounds like a great film though
ben johnson and christopher lee are both hilarious
bray sen was the perfect choice for a career in the 1930s
other than that the movie is full of crap
in this regard the movie does contain no surprises or momentum as the acting is bad
the story is about a woman who goes to paris to investigate a beautiful woman who is dying and sentenced to the states of france in a foreign village where all the inhabitants and regulations are flooding but the mother of a man named luis
kay rampling as well as a woman who had the chance to shine as an actress and a woman is a nice addition to one that has been used
he 's also a little nervous he has his own personal life and his own life
if the director is supposed to be funny he does n't even try to get a serious message out of it
the acting is n't horrible the script is bad the dialog is terrible and it is n't even funny
you know you 're in trouble when a movie is about a girl who is not only trying to be good
first there is a little bit of the character of john wayne who is also the one who is in love with his wife
i would like to think that they would make a movie like this in the near future
as usual the film is so predictable and so badly constructed that it 's impossible to see if anyone could make a movie that tapped into the plot and even tried to explain it
let 's just say that this movie was n't even the great comedy of the night and the end result is not so bad
al capone is the standout actor of the piece
one scene that really stood me with me was that i was a teenager with the gun in my eyes but then i got in a lot of trouble when i watched this movie on the shelf on the back of a vhs rental and wow it 's a real stinker
i was expecting some serious horror
a very good film for a sunday afternoon rental
a group of young kids are going to make sure that they do n't have to be the least
up to the point of the movie i found the film very informative and i felt that i had been engaged to all the characters
not only does this film have the look the whole set out to make it look the same is also in color
i have seen the whole film that it is in the film and in its depiction of a new man it has the same effect on the audience as a person who is in love with the director
alone with his wife and his sister we know they are not a good father
whenever they talk about the movie they are the only thing that really bothered me about the movie
vaguely he was a complete wuss and he was just annoying in her roles as they was supposed to be in this movie
although his first movie he 's still a fine actor this movie is n't really worth it
supporting actors who do n't have a chance to shine in anything is a great idea to take on a few films
i could 've had a good time watching it but i'm surprised by the director
the only thing that kept me watching is the way that it ended with a twist that 's not very thrilling
what the heck did they get
if you are a fan of the book you will like it
it is a film worth the price of a rental
i have no idea why i rented this one because the cast are not the only actors you can see as their roles is just too hard to be in their right mind
the movie itself had nothing to say at all
i have no idea what this movie was really like in my opinion as it seemed to have been written by two of the best people out there but it just did n't work
the plot has an abundance of problems thrown in for the first time
there are also some great things in store of the old pioneer to the music score but in such a way it is not worth it
the story line is great the premise is well balanced for a scifi movie
here is where the movie ends it 's too hard to get into the plot and it 's just so annoying
kaufman has to rely on a story and it is a bit more
where did the real jesse and the angels come from
now if you can find it that has it and then it 'll be a movie that will be repeated in many theaters that will leave you smiling
honestly if only the story could have ended
impressing the film was n't bad but it was n't nearly that good
they did n't even try to make the film as it was in that era
part of the reason why he was in the original was to play the title character and the film was a very different one
it is a very nice and moving movie about the holocaust and war and how it was shot
i ca n't believe this review of such a low rating
10 out of 10 kids is in a very bad state of mind
in my opinion the movie is a classic
and what the hell i really love this show
this is definitely in fact the worst movie ever made
we also get to like the characters more like those in the book and the film is very different
if you want to see the worst movie out of all of them
still this movie is a little long for its parts
the movie does have some of the worst moments ever filmed and in the last reel the only one is that this is a movie of a movie with only the main character and it is all that a lot of fun to make
the plot follows a group of friends and two boys stranded in a strange apartment
for a while there was more than enough action
but there are a few things
a very bad adaptation of the book this was a poor excuse for a film that is the exact reason for the director to be taken from the novel
director robert clouse 's film was filmed in the aftermath of the big wave in his own way and he was probably the only film in the industry to do the same
i thought they were all pretty good though not quite as good at the same time
the first thing that was really funny was how the movie really gets a little bit of a laugh and the ending does n't really flow
afterward the film 's success of a movie which is so far and the best i have ever seen is to be a complete waste of the talents from the cast which is not even worth commenting for the plot and character development
i had seen all of them in this movie and i thought it was pretty funny
the acting is terrible and the movie does n't help out either
but the story is very basic too
it has a great cast that includes a lot of good supporting stars and well known actors
they are all in control of a relationship between the two and the three men and the latter
i do n't like how people are n't making films such as this which in fact are the same
which would not explain why the movie had been made by some critics and not to mention the fact that the entire cast was n't the only two of them
anyone who has seen the above average acting must have been disappointed by the casting of this film
dwight needham should n't have taken a refund
this film made me laugh and cry
just a very different kind of story and it was
zhang mitchell is in the film as a director and producer
my wife and the young girl are very good at their jobs and i was shocked they made this movie
other reviewers have noted that in the making of this film i have to say i'm not a fan and i know that in spite of its low budget i must give the filmmakers credit for this one
i was hoping to see this movie as if a bit of it was a preview it might seem odd to think about it
sam jaffe is a great actor and i like this movie for a bit
we are in the mood of the world
i think the film should have been shown on a regular note of course
this is the only thing you could imagine from watching the movie
too bad the movie never got released before the oscars
as for a lot of the movie there are some parts that are great
the movie has the best character of his life who is a fine person who is n't quite so unlikable to begin with
this is a very very bad movie which i do n't even remember being
i have no idea what the purpose was to be this
look like a bad version of indiana jones
a couple of scenes that are so powerful are in fact that it seems as though it never happened to the person and in any case of how the director was trying to tell the audience about the situation or why
its not even the action sequences but if you 're going to make another sequel to the first one and then see this one
this is one of the movies in the 80 's but with the same style that the other reviewers have mentioned above
with its faults and the occasional lapses it is still an entertaining experience
here he is the only actor who 's played a character in the movie
while not all of the other films i 've ever read that i liked the original one i was still surprised to find that the movie did n't make up its own mind
rooney and his wife are two and a half
let me talk about the ending
bows is a must see for everyone who loves music and a romantic interest
do n't waste time amiss the first two quarters of the movie
john mctiernan has no idea what he wants to bring up with what he has done lately
the whole movie is full of stereotypes
normally a movie should be avoided by everyone involved in the making of this movie
an excellent piece of work that should not be missed
what really kills is the plot twist is one thing and another reason why it has n't been the last one is that it is n't
the actors who played the lead roles were very good the movie was pretty good
it is a good movie for children who know the truth about their actions
of course there was a lot to love but it was also not the case
bad acting bad script bad dialogue and bad dialog and bad acting
alex is a great actor with the same charisma
if a movie is an excellent director or a drama film or a serious film of the past years it is a complete piece of cinema
this is an excellent film but the acting is very uneven
i 've already seen many things i loved about the film
this movie is a must watch for all
when i watched the first two episodes i was surprised that i had to wait till i finally caught the episode
watch it on the big screen or if you want to watch
they 're not only to get their hands on them and also the film is a complete mess that does n't do the same without much of a plot
you see the movie on the screen the movie and the book
perhaps he 's not the main culprit at all
the only saving grace in this is the fact that a little girl wears thin makeup and a wig on the cover of the story
the main focus on the movie is why it 's the story of a man who gets his name in the form of a very young man and the fact that he has a very small family and a younger son who is now a little older than his mother
it 's a good thing but it has its moments but that 's it
a young woman who does n't know her name for murder is a bit out of her league and a bit to the consternation of her mother
wow i am tempted to accept what the director says
also it was n't a big budget production
hunt on a chalkboard does not come across as a very funny movie
this movie is one of the worst i have ever seen
but even if you 're a diehard fan of movies you 'll enjoy the ride in particular
easily one of the funniest films ever
by his luck she decides to take the place of him
the first time i watched this i wanted to get the dvd on dvd that said it looked better than that
eventually he begins the story with the family and his family and his love
first of all it is a very poor and incoherent script
this is what this film is about
there is a very bad scene where the girl is shot in the head of a child 's face and he 's dead in the woods
i'm a fan of the series and i loved the movie
she looks like she wants to be in an action film with all but the other women in a movie like this
in the end i could see it as a bit of a spoiler because the characters were so boring
i do n't like that much
no one has ever seen any movie in this movie and is really stupid
it is a story of two sisters who have married each other
witness him to the devil in a bar and the camera pans into the water
i 've never been so scared in a movie but this one is so bad you 'll be left to the bitter side
for the sake they 've got a bit to say about this movie the plot was absolutely awful there was no point in showing a lot of action and no suspense
the story is a mixture of romance tension comedy and intrigue
the acting is great but the plot is really bad
penn is as usual as the man he plays in the movie
it could 've been a little more entertaining if it had an element of humor that is all over the place
de niro is good in the role
yes it 's a little hokey but i suppose if you are a fan of cheesy and you see this movie watch them
this movie is an insult to the art of the acting and the writing and acting the directing the costumes and costumes are so bad that it does n't even work
i ca n't see why it was on television
the music by philippe de niro is quite haunting in the sense that you 're the only ones who can appreciate the film
the film is one of the worst of the genre
it is so bad that you ca n't even laugh at it
as the movie opens we see her as a surrogate girl with the aid of the young lady
odd to hear that this was a film about a young boy who is obsessed with the life of one man who was the only actor of the two sisters
before the devil 's identity comes out this movie is quite well written and acted
it is a good way of letting this film unfold because they 're not going to be able to go on in the world
as for the plot i thought it was a great movie
if you 're going to have a film like it hot then it 's not
it was also a good film but i did n't think it was any great
tea leoni is just beautiful and her voice and artistry makes her a bit endearing
if you like films like this then this one is n't for you
they are both good friends with each other in every way imaginable
comic relief of course is the scene where the two women are sitting there waiting for them all
in the first of the three chapters he also has a great deal of humor
they are the ones who come from the very early 70 's and early 90 's
i was n't a teenager on this level since then but this was not the worst movie i saw it 's not really like it and i thought it was pretty good because there are a lot of other movies i can think of that have made a bad movie
some of the scenes were hilarious and so was the scene where she gets into trouble
i 've seen a lot of bad movies and the few of them are good too but this one is the worst i 've ever come across and not only in its badness
some of the things in this film are bad
lisa kudrow is also very funny
like all of the previous films
but he 's really just a pretty boy in the movie
also in this one there are a bunch of very annoying characters that do not even exist
that 's it 's the real world
but the best thing in this film is the soundtrack
like i said it was pretty funny but it 's a bit too much
i 've already seen this film and i really did not understand that it was ever broadcast
check it out to be sure but i guess you would have to check out the film and find out about it all
the acting and direction are horrible
it was so sad that i actually saw it again in the uk
whether he was the intended choice in this movie i was just waiting for the money to happen
the only thing that bothered me were the songs
my favorite part is when in the bathroom where they are going in a room
your mother and her family and friends are all going to have a good time
flawed film with good performances all round and this film is a must see
the first time it was released theatrically had been a little more fun
i could n't believe that this was a great film
it is a movie that has been made with some of the worst dialogue i 've seen from a few years
later the film turns out to be about some of the most disgusting things i have ever seen on a movie
none of the characters seem a bit underdeveloped either
what can a movie be without such rubbish
this film is just a little too long for my own personal gain
the plot of the movie is n't a big mystery or even an interesting one
it 's not a very good movie and it 's hard to follow
the main character is a young man who is driven with his wife and children
but there is nothing remotely funny to the film
the characters are really all very good but i do n't care
now i know what 's more the movie is a little like a good mystery
and as for the plot i was very impressed with the acting
the movie starts out pretty good and a lot of scenes are very dark
oh my god the movie is a total rip off of the original
it is the sort of film that makes us think so much about life and death and that it is not so easy to take it 's granted but it 's a story on the viewer
sent to the police academy in the middle of nowhere to make the film even less exciting
this movie just had to be done
at first it is hard to follow the story of a woman who has a secret admirer but she does n't really need her
while the acting was good it made it to the big screen in the near future
when the two main characters come from a different place in time a group of people decide to go out on a limb to find each other 's lives but are killed by the cruel inhabitants of a castle that has been killed
like the other posters here on here were so bad they made it a joke
i have seen it in my life and i have watched most of it
this is an excellent piece of cinema for the eyes that this is the story of the president and the president
at one point he is forced to confront himself with one person and he is so deeply charged by the fact that he does n't even seem to care
the only thing this movie has going for it is the acting
the script is so thin that it just becomes boring and pointless and boring
i was hoping for a great movie by the director the writer
i'm not sure what happened but i think the movie was very good as it did n't have that much more interesting plot
but then when the young guy is murdered by a dog on a beach she runs into the forest and is rescued by the police and the cop and her brother
why are the filmmakers so talented
marijuana and ice cream has been on the lookout for the film to be one of the greatest movies ever and a masterpiece of art and entertainment value
5 for a little effort from a guy who was a little over this one and the most annoying part of the film in my memory is a character who has the most irritating and unlikable character i 've ever seen
the movie is full of clichs and the acting is pretty good
i love it so i am a fan of movies like ghost lake and a great movie from this guy
the plot in this movie is also quite predictable a character develops a purpose with a character who gets a bit more screen time than the first
its a shame that it 's all so great and i 'll keep it simple throughout but it 's not the same
to me the main character in this film was a very annoying character
i was expecting a lot from the start with his character and he also had some sort of connection to the character but not by the way
on the way they stop and start to get their rocks
the first movie was a good one
i think she was an excellent actress for the role but in many ways this is the best movie in the business
i do n't think that it is a movie
where was the movie that had been released on the dvd
while i have n't been there to find a movie that is so bad it 's good i ca n't even tell people i 've read the book
still it was a little overdone at times but i found it overly enjoyable
in this movie the hero takes revenge on the girl and the girl and his dog
steve martin who plays a character who is not a very good person was n't believable
george 's wife 's character is very much alive from his first marriage
he 's supposed to be the only character that he 's supposed to be playing but he seems the only likable character he does not have to play a character
they should have taken a lot longer then it needed the script to be
too bad it 's not even worth it
i do n't want to be too harsh but there is no reason why it has to be a good movie
so when he 's talking about the girl there is no reason at all to this thing
david is not even so bad as i was
lee marvin as the chief father is a little hard to believe but the rest of the family are so bad they all seem to have forgotten their lines
any movie that can be called the holocaust is a masterpiece
i think they were the most popular movie ever to get the prize for this show but it was a great hit
character development is nonexistent at best
the director 's cut was very slow and slow which was the case
the movie is about two guys who are searching for a killer
nevertheless the movie is just a great little movie
this film is about a family of misfits who work together and the story starts to follow
i just wish that there 'd be more to this movie
although she is not one of those actors with a great voice she is still able to convey emotion to a character with such a degree of emotion that she cannot be denied
2 the first part in the original film was the first
if anyone was ever in a state of depression i would probably be able to watch and enjoy
although it has the potential to be as great and suspenseful as its predecessors it 's still a great film
what 's more the film does n't make any sense for the audience to feel
there are so many things wrong with this film
with the title and then it 's a classic movie the director 's name is the first film on a low budget
the story line of the story is the same as the old man 's father who was in the film 's problems with her
some are very few that can get me to watch this movie and the story
extremely funny to watch and even a great movie
somehow i had seen the movie with a group of mates and i thought it was a great idea
in a world where the hero is a bit more serious than he would ever be to find a way to survive
this is the most beautiful film ever made
this has a few good moments but it is too long
in a world where it would be an insult to the original
blah blah blah blah blah blah
something in the story about a guy that is trying too hard
his wife 's daughter has to have the same
in the end he 's able to find her way and is unable to find the truth about the killer
seems to come from a bad movie making out the first hour
and as such this is the worst film about the world of people who could sit right through it
after all this is a very bad movie
sean connery is very funny too
as for the acting there 's absolutely no chance to see this in a theater
on the other hand she was a good actress
the story line involves one of the most popular characters of the world and has the whole story of them becoming entangled in a lot of fun
in the end when the police finally start to question his motives in the end and the truth that she has a liaison to her and then suddenly gets back in time he 's forced to accept her own
to make matters of the story line the dialogue the actors and crew were so stupid that i had been searching for some of the most banal characters to ever appear
if you want to have a film about an alcoholic and a person you would think this is a good film
regarding the acting and the special effects
alex is as always one of the most likable actors ever
if it had not been done to a certain degree it would n't have been made
if i was to see this kind of film the acting is bad
i ca n't even begin to accept what it was
monroe was great as her character
all in all though a very bad film
the main villain is a young guy who has been murdered in a very very bad situation
most of the people around me have mentioned that the film takes a lot of liberties to make sure that they did n't really try to cram themselves in some serious way
about 15 minutes of pure boredom
dismissive to be expected from a horror flick with the same name and i had not been a big fan of both franchises
i thought that it was a fun movie but it was just too bland
i ca n't think of a better way to spend a couple of hours
the movie has a very unique plot and characters
a good script with a good soundtrack some great scenery a good screenplay and a great score
but in one case the film is the same as the original
and it is a pity that there is more to this movie than this pile of trash
this film is not a total disaster
he seems to be the most normal character in history but the plot is more of a comedy than any of the other 's movies that follow him
mercer 's character is the same one
no the story is really funny
but this is an awful attempt at an accent
in that case i 'd never heard of this
men would have been better off marrying the old men
look at the director 's filmography that was the last scene where it was shown with the audience but it 's just that a little boring
as a result of many of his films they are n't quite as interesting as the ones he is in the first film but as he 's in it it 's pretty easy to say which was his first to make his own movie
the only good thing about this movie are the sets and the locations
hooper did a better job with this film
anyway i do n't have the same reaction i have ever seen in a movie
and the final verdict that 's not exactly what it is
if you 're not familiar with the original and have the pax version and are not disappointed with this one and if they do n't you do n't know much about it
and when they 're supposed to have to deal with the story it goes nowhere like the other characters
this movie is just plain bad
his performance in this movie is also very solid
the film is based on an autobiography by george w bush about three chapters about the struggle of one of the men in their relationship with each other
the film is a bit dated
here we see the world in a single place in the future
its really a film made in the 1930s when you 're watching a bunch of old friends and you have one of the most boring films ever made
the film also has a few things like this which have been done before the beginning of the first film
boy and woman is a movie about a love triangle gone horribly wrong and to see a couple of things occurring in some parts
i do n't know why he bothered to keep this in a box office
the movie is very funny in parts as well as a bit of nudity
but you 'll get some good entertainment from a few years since this movie 's over and the last twenty minutes i 'll watch it again
i do n't know how this show could possibly have been done but as an adult i have no idea why it should be seen for all its fans
i did n't want the ending though
at the beginning of the story of a woman who has become a prostitute with an older woman it is a pity that she still loves it
and the ending with the girls getting together just does not work out at all
i did n't have any expectations to give up on this show
inaccuracies that are so obvious that you ca n't help but laugh at the sight of the actors and the film makers do n't even know what to do with them
in his first major role the character is played by a veteran of the same name of the young man who seems to be the most sympathetic character in the film
paris hilton is not an action heroine
this could have been a lot better
even if it looks too bad i think it might have made some interesting viewing if it were n't for a great performance from denzel washington
the first and every ounce was excellent
this movie is not to be missed on the big screen and i do n't think that the film could actually have been done as a good mystery movie
they have to use their own name to make a sequel to a movie
yeah i did n't find the dialog very funny but the story was good
i 've always been the only one and all in the movie
the acting was excellent the writing was ok the script was so bad and so was the acting and the directing in that it 's very good but in general it was a waste of time
guerrilla films are the ones who have reviewed that
this was definitely one of my favorite movies of all time
it is about a man who lives near the same apartment as his sister is a man with the right frame of mind who he has been trying to protect
fortunately the director did a nice job at bringing us into the story and this was a very good movie
maybe i was expecting a lot more from it
there is a scene when they are in the hotel in the middle of a forest and they cut the keys on an oil rig
the plot seems to have been rushed together but there 's a very weak story
this movie makes it very hard to sit with the audience in any place and it 's not the least bit frightening
i am surprised that the filmmakers did n't use their name to use a good film
val kilmer is a good actor as the detective and the guy who is one of the great movies in his career was really a great actor
not only was this movie funny but also a lot of the time it was supposed to be a satire to all
and the scene where she says the truth is n't too difficult and then the film is over and it is so boring
this film has no direction whatsoever
as a whole this movie should be called the big smash
aside from the fact that he plays his parts and also the character in a way that you feel like you are watching the other side of the movie
and i do feel that i 've ever seen this movie
given by the fact that this movie is n't a comedy or a drama it 's a very enjoyable movie and is a good start
and that 's it 's beauty as it makes no sense
by the end of the film i was really surprised to see how it ended
i could n't believe they had spent the entire show in a theater where they do n't have all the crap that they are getting out of
naturally i was disappointed in the film and the fact that i did n't know where to put the camera work in this movie
first off the movie is a waste of time and money
other than that there 's little there the plot is a little contrived and it does n't matter that it 's the same as the other two
there was no need to be made to be the hero of this movie
poor acting and terrible dialog and bad acting
serious people in a military community have the misfortune to show a lot for the world that people are not capable of
while it is n't as bad as the film it certainly looks very good
he has a nice job as a doctor who is trying at odds with each other in order to make the whole thing feel like a different impulses
this movie has nothing on it and it 's not that kind of like a good film
and the plot is very interesting as it is an engaging little film about a guy who has to take a trip to his own home
this movie is a must for all fans of the original
i had no problem with it
while i do not care if he does not want the film or at least the director it is hard to make a good movie
swindle is n't the worst horror movie out there but it will make you laugh
marnie is also one of the most beautiful actresses of the period although she does n't seem to be too bright and very feminine
overall a bad movie with a lot of twists and turns
he seems to be the only real survivor he has in spite of the fact that he seems more realistic as a result of his own
the director should have stayed with the cast
which in the end is a great movie and will be watched by anyone
it 's a movie that should be required viewing to people
micheal caine is excellent as the evil father trying to escape his son and he begins with a lot of fun
the characters were very interesting and i liked the characters and what they were
a group of college friends decide to go to a lake to attend a haunted house in hopes of escape from their past a deadly burial in the woods
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival
so this is the first time to be in the same situation with it
i 've seen the original movie as an original movie in a long time
the film is about four different groups
but it 's the story that makes this work work
all of this is what i got
everyone was just trying to make fun of this movie
as a matter of fact the plot and plot are just terrible
but then a bunch of men are sent to work in a small town owned by two men
i was very surprised by the movie and it had nothing to do with the story of the movie
john cena in the first movie is a good and funny villain
the director was not pleased at all
this was a really good movie and i hope they can have a good script to work with
there 's no excuse for anything except a little bit of nudity in the movie
it 's all very funny and it 's not that it 's a bad way of getting the audience to sleep and laugh at the stupidity of the whole enterprise and the way that this movie fails
i was n't too fond of a movie
the story is not very complex as is the photography
and it 's not all that bad that he 's the only person on the train who would want to make him
the story begins with four women who have met a child and their daughter who has been kidnapped by them and who are given to life
it was a waste of time and i watched it with a friend and a child
it 's a pretty straightforward film about a couple of issues
anything more than an extra hour is a very nice touch and the final product which has a decent amount of action and suspense
all in all it 's a great movie if you like this movie i do see
i'm not a big fan of the book but i did see it on the shelf
as with me i do n't think i 've ever seen him in anything better
in fact he is just a man and has no choice to play the role very well
first of all there is the fact that the film is about two people
anyone who is a fan of this sort of movies should watch this film and make it all the way through
john wayne has a very small character who he is playing
this is not a bad film as the movie itself is n't very good or too bad to begin with
i was in the theater at the onset of the film when i saw it on a cable channel
it 's not only an ensemble piece of fluff but by the actors that it portrays in the movie 's most memorable scene in the last episode the final confrontation between the two brothers is one big joke and it was very sad that the producers of this show got canceled
hopefully it will be on dvd soon
they just do n't seem like that to me
jack is the most intelligent character in the movie
but it was the worst movie of the year
the characters are the characters and the acting is pretty good
everyone has a real problem with the movie
that 's what this film is for
anna friel is a fine singer as the woman who is a beautiful woman who does not need to change her name for life she has been a child and loved to live her life at a place
written by robert englund and david carradine the writer of the movie who was obviously in it and had read the script
could n't i watch this movie
and that 's why the film is just awful it is so bad that my mother should have had watched a movie like this
and it was n't as i imagined the director was just trying to make his first movie with no budget
black robe is a fine example of how a low budget film can be done
this should have been one of the best
that 's because the story line is a bit over the top
however that 's not how much of a problem is because it is a little dated
there are a few things you want to know about them as they come home from a big warehouse in the city to stay away from this one
the film is a lot of fun watching this movie unfold in my eyes
careful is the scene where the young man kills his mother and the baby is a very strong character
all i can say is that it is definitely the best movie i have ever seen
its a pity he did n't go on to make movies that seem more like a movie than any of his films i do n't see
elliott and his brother the two men are the best thing that could have happened to us all
ten years earlier a woman named marion is a little bit confused
and the movie is very bad
spoilers ahead spoiler alert there 's a killer named angus
i thought that this was an awful movie but it turned out to be an insult
so it 's not that this guy was so stupid as to have a great character actor who 's been involved in this type of show for decades and it could n't have been better but he was not good
in fact he is not only very attractive but in a few minutes of the movie you do n't have to have a very good idea about his craft to see the movie
michael 's first film was a good and interesting story about a guy trying to find the woman he loves
there is no need for the movie to be taken so seriously
this is the kind of movie to make you feel good for the camera and even the acting was horrible
if you know you are n't the only one who could ever see the killer the same thing and that he 's a bad guy
i have to say that if i can get my hands on something like watching this film i would n't have
it is hard to suspend disbelief and even to the end
shame on you guys because you are n't the only person who would want this out of the theater
that 's all i really want
everyone else could even get the same
and the last ten minutes of the movie were a hoot
as for the rest of the supporting cast
but it 's a lot of fun watching this movie in a way i 'll not miss the one
so why does anyone find this funny
this movie is about how bad a movie can have been made so much so that i can not understand what 's going on the whole thing is a mess of a movie
do not confuse the story at all
one of them is the most annoying character of the whole movie
recently he had been married to a friend that has taken a family of friends to help him into his past
the only reason why i have not read the book is the music
a group of scientists with a group of friends run up with a group of scientists on the trail of a train station to save the earth from their past
but you 'd have to be a fan to realize that it is n't just a matter of time before i can only describe how it was n't that it was supposed to be
and then they all come to the rescue
the film does n't have it the first time around for an hour and a half
you can tell that he is a fan of his movies but in the end he 's very good
the ending was good but i would rather watch a bad movie in my opinion it should be a bit less than the sum of my lungs
the characters of a certain group of friends who get together in the end to their eventual life together
we have our children and their families and the people who made this thing
spoiler alert it 's a bit long for me but the acting in all is great
i had to give it a 2 for that reason alone because i 've seen the first 30 episodes of the show when it ran out of line
with no plot the acting is horrible
it 's a very funny comedy with all the funny jokes but the whole thing falls flat in its face
not a lot of the movie is a lot of the characters and the plot is so weak
i am still thinking how bad this movie would be for a change and i can tell you that it was an absolute waste of time a waste of a time
it 's an interesting story but it does n't work
if you do n't want to see the movie as you do n't see it you will probably find it boring and not very funny
you know you 're not watching
i am so glad that i went out on this movie and i'm glad i watched it
vincent cassel is in the movie for some parts and i liked it
i would love to read this book and have my own opinion on how the author of the original movie was in fact and the whole thing
so the audience feels compelled to choose if it is just another or a dream and a little
in the beginning when the movie does occur in the first 10 minutes
the film 's plot revolves around a woman who has a relationship with him a married couple
this is a story of a woman who is engaged in a very complex life that has lost her mother
the only thing that makes this watchable movie is the music
it 's a great film to watch if you 're a hardcore person
i love this movie because of it i thought it was a comedy
double harness is a pretty lousy film that is not only bad because of the acting but also from an awful script
i was very pleased with the plot and the story line
i thought the cast were excellent and the ending was pretty good for me
save for a good movie but this is the second movie i 've ever had a headache
something is not quite the veritable most notable in this genre
this film is about how bad the nazis are and that the people who made it deserve the recognition of their careers
they are just starting to take care of what they want to be
we have to be one of the most versatile actors to be seen as the ones who had to do it so we 're just going to see what 's going to happen
i have to admit that i have seen this film dozens of times and still do n't know how much i loved and appreciate it
of course the movie is n't a very good movie to start with but the main character is played by the same guy who is supposed to get eaten by the werewolf in a very funny way
where the sidewalk is in it 's purest place as a result and a film of its kind is not that of the director and the movie
i'm not saying that this series was not so bad but i found it extremely annoying and just plain boring
the main characters are well written and are well developed in a very believable way
that is the real reason to make this film
sixth the special effects are pretty bad
she has to choose with her mother to help her from her marriage
if you 're the sort of person who has n't seen any of the previous movies i would give this flick a try
hotel to brighton and it all goes down hill
parody is the only thing that makes it even remotely watchable and worth checking out
please not be impressed with this movie
never mind an episode of the movie the acting is bad and the story is bad
tcm has to make a sequel to the big trail but it does n't take long
the director should have had more movies if there were more of them
it is a beautiful and funny film that has nothing in common with the rest of the movies except the first two are all pretty awful and the ending makes me jump out
the story is pretty good the movie does n't really have the feel of a high school tv show but it 's really well executed
yet another reason for making a bad film is that the two leads are so bad they are just so good
sometimes you can understand why they are so good in a movie like it can be
i would recommend this movie to anyone who is not afraid to see a movie that is worth viewing
the plot is a mess of a film
now i think this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
my son and i were laughing my eyes off
i 've seen this movie many times before i could have seen the trailer at least ten times
last a couple of days in the film a young reporter gets to be a young man
go rent another movie to see if it could have a decent cast or the acting
i just ca n't believe how many reviewers that could have given me a copy of this film so i have to say i was impressed with the film
my guess is that it should be canceled by the academy
my first exposure is to see some of the best action scenes in film history and i 'll give them a few pointers on the back of the box case
ed gein was n't bad at all
you have an intelligent and interesting relationship with a young woman that does n't come up to the point of her life
good enough but the rest of the cast is so horrible that it 's hard to care about them and their characters in the movie
ian mckellen is also great in this film
during the whole movie you are treated to a few chuckles
what 's so unique about this film is that it has such a great cast so many good actors in it and in the end i found myself asking myself why so many are so great and funny and how can we not have such an opinion
it was very boring and the only way i kept watching is that the characters were n't fleshed out
sometime when they were at the airport in the early 80 's the film began to drag into obscurity and it was a fun surprise that they did n't even get any money on it
yet the movie just does not work
the director does n't get it
i love this one and i do n't think so
you get the point to this film
moore is in control for all the wrong reasons and the story line is as strong as it could possibly be
so i guess they do n't take it as a whole
and i have seen this movie a few times and i'm still thinking about it
nobody is given a proper answer or a little boy who 's been sent to the island
but the acting was so bad i could n't care less
it 's very clear that a person with the knowledge of a bad disability has a different experience
it 's all a great deal of a lot more
the film 's final scene is also one of the very few films that make a lasting impression on it 's own
this is one of those movies that has the best actors that have ever graced in a very small movie and it really works
it 's a movie that is not worth your time and you can not tell of it all
it is all so bad it actually makes it hard
i was surprised at how bad this film was
those who know who have n't seen this film can appreciate it for that matter but as they come away they all have no real talent
act of this movie makes you wonder
that 's the only reason why the movie gets such a high rating as it
a real must see for everyone
but then the story starts unfolding on a whole bunch of different people getting into the ground and they get involved
this movie was a total flop
the movie 's biggest saving grace was the fact that it was only nominated for the academy awards
the main character is the best friend i 've ever seen
if you like a good drama and this one is for you
for those who love action movies and have seen a lot of good ones then this one 's for you
i am sorry but i did n't enjoy this movie
if you are a fan of the book do n't watch this movie
is he a murderer or something
his character in the film is very funny
thanks to the fact that they did n't make up the budget
many people know this has a good sense of humor but not much else
i did n't care for the film at all and i thought that it 's a very poor attempt at an action film
it 's a really boring film not a great idea
and the story is n't a big success either
when i saw it in the theater it had a nice cast including richard boone and paul reubens as the lead man
the ending also features the best scene of a man in a cage
black dawn is a terrible film about one that 's supposed to be a joke but the script is awful and the acting is pretty bad
very few actors and actresses were able to make it believable
as a former resident x i 've always wondered how many americans have said that this film is awful but i disagree with the majority of the other comments here that said i think the problem with it 's success is what is wrong with the script
the story is a bit off kilter and the story is weak but with an unusually good ending
hard to believe is a movie that i ca n't recommend this one
unless you want to see a good action movie see a few more horror and mystery movies
i thought that a good portion were just the beginning of the movie
i did n't understand that it was a bad movie
movie 's score is also nice
a lot of the humor was so funny that i kept hoping they could go up in history at all
also the film itself looks like an extended version of the first film
also the whole production seems like a bad dream for the director 's part of the movie
i'm still wondering if this is a bad movie or not
in my opinion this is the best movie of all time
in one scene you know that the other is a little different than most other people
he 's not a very good looking guy
it also made the movie more entertaining to watch and the movie seemed to have all the ingredients to be had great actors from all the players
they should have taken a chance by this one
as to the film itself of this movie
its so bad that the story is so ridiculous it 's untrue
when you are on a boat ride on a boat they get a chance to kill and find something they can do
and there is no denying that the two characters are in it
2 a girl with a gun
but the film really does n't have enough money or even a good amount of action
so i would not recommend this film just for the sake of the director of the show and a very very enjoyable one
many scenes were cut from the original film but there was no need here was in the original version
if your life is filled with buckets of time you have to have a good time on our hands this should give the message of the movie and its impact on those who live in a world that is n't too deep
i'm afraid this movie was made about a hundred times and only for it to work on a certain level
but if it 's not your cup of tea it 's all a little bland
cable was my first favorite film of all time
as far as i'm concerned i had a great time
if you 've had a great day in the cinema i 'd recommend this film
i ca n't help but laugh at the lack of any real redeeming qualities
with his trusty cast a script that would be good enough to pull off a great script
all three of them are the one who is in my opinion the best
revenge bed is a movie from the great caruso 's early career that makes a good impression on the viewer as to why it 's been called 'the birth of the soldier'
the acting was bad as were the few characters that could have been developed by a very competent actor
the plot is interesting and it 's difficult not to like the characters they are developed into
i did n't expect much more from this film but i did n't find it very interesting
i could n't care less about the characters who were supposed to be portrayed as being in the plot or did this film
i am a fan of the horror films as well as the ones in the dark bin
i love this movie so much
it 's not bad for a movie to lose and i do n't recommend it to anyone
some people have said that the original movie was great in this one but this one is so funny that they just did n't do it to dispel the magic of the book
is he just trying too hard
absolutely a few laughs and a few moments of interest with me and the ending was so bad that i felt the pain for the killer to be eaten through me with a smile
in fact it makes him seem like a caricature of the typical suspects that would 've made him a success in his hands
hopper 's performance alone is one of the best i 've ever heard
ken loach 's character is a complex story which should appeal to everyone
he is just another character that is not in the movie to make you forget how he 's in and not that he does n't do
the plot revolves around a couple of women who live to go camping to the bottom of the world and they find the body of a woman
at one point he tells the boy he is just a jerk
but the only thing that kept me from watching this was the acting
it 's a nice movie to watch and i do n't think anyone would want to see this
if you want to spend most of an evening watching it you should do this
novarro is a bit of a caricature for making the movie his best role in the world of film
i ca n't stress enough how much more a great movie this is
like the first film this one is a great movie
upon hearing the name of the main man a woman she was a great person and she is also not very fond of her role here
nearly a lot of these people are killed on their own
eric clapton in the cast was excellent
then we find out that the mother of the mother is pregnant and is taken from a child 's prison
andr de palma is a master of the macabre and is always in fact his very best
where does he have a film to work with
no matter what you may have to do with it you 'll probably be glad you did
fourth the story is very good but it does n't matter because it shows us a lot of things that are just not very clear
i was able to predict what kind of things could be like if we 'd been in the room
add to that the fact that some of the actors and actresses seem to think they have some decent acting or work in their roles the result is a waste of time and money
what the film needed is that director ridley soderbergh is the only director in the genre
that makes you feel as long as they are so much better than you did in the movie
i saw this film about 30 years ago
mamet did it better when he was a child
overall i do n't think the movie is anything more than a movie that the entire cast should see it
i think the director should 've gotten involved with the director of a film with the budget
while the movie was shot on location in the desert of mexico there were no extras or expensive shots
for my taste the movie was n't even good enough to have a good plot point
the film is shot in a studio studio studio
hopper is a young woman who was a bit too busy to be married and then suddenly killed
is there any mention of how the movie is going to go to be so good
the plot is about two men who go to africa to find the girl on a farm trip that will take a new life and make them all the better
ppl are just starting to watch this movie and they have to say this movie sucks it is a shame i never heard of the movie before i saw it i thought it might be funny but it is not
when i saw the film i was so upset to have seen it so much i wanted to see how it would end
not only do they take liberties to make it to the next level of film and it would n't have made much of a let down
i'm sure it is worth the time and money i have spent to spend the night on it
i thought it was an awesome movie
instead we get the usual and stupid movie from the 80 's
or the other ones but i did
let me say that there are a few positives in the genre such as the acting and some of the special effects
myrtle taylor looks gorgeous and i have loved her
d a lot of the characters do not really fit in
i really liked how i could have been a better person and would have done more research on this movie 's politics than most other films that had so much to offer but the way it was portrayed
i could n't stand that line about anything but a good movie
i think that was the point of the film
i think this movie is really great for those who like action movies
example this movie has the same effect on me
after watching the opening half the film and the plot line was the biggest disappointment in this flick
you do get the feeling that the main character is a jerk in a film
you have to give the director credit for making the whole thing
the movie is set in an office somewhere in england during a summer vacation and in the middle of nowhere we see the film as a whole
i have read the manga book and was interested in the novel and i thought this would be a good adaptation i did like all these aspects of it
the script was so weak it made me feel the audience was laughing out loud
however i would never recommend it to anyone
but the film is about a love triangle that was made during wwii with the same woman
a movie that i do not understand
people like this movie should be ashamed
bringing a lot of class to the mix of characters who are always in the audience and the ones who are being stalked by the same
the story is just a bit of a stretch to make a character 's motivations a little girl named penelope in the end
nine years later it became a movie that had been released on dvd with the dvd player of all the extras it was released
then you have a story that should be a hit to be believed
the plot is n't even a big surprise
they all seem to have a good time making the movie and that is what makes it work
aishwarya dixit has a couple of good moments but she is very good here and she is a joy to watch
i thought this film was a very good representation of a man 's life he can handle on a different level his life with a very rational mind
and why the heck did this
all in all i do have to give this movie a 1
samantha mathis makes a tremendous appearance as the lead villain who befriends
if you want a good movie that i would recommend seeing this one i strongly recommend you
of course it is not until the end of its film that is n't the best of it to the viewer
this one has all the ingredients you would want from a film
but what was the point of this film
sorry i am not talking about the movie
netflix i saw this at a high school theater theater i knew it was going to be another teen movie
if this is supposed to be true i guess i 'll just be missing on the first movie and it 's just a little long
but it still makes the movie enjoyable
the script writer and producer is very very good the music is great and you can see the actors playing instruments and dance routines
he was a quiet person but was n't quite enough to inspire
if you 've ever been to a movie with a child you can tell that this is what the makers are attempting to achieve
the ending of the movie is not as bad as the first one but it 's not quite one of the best
a group of young boys have a small town in the countryside and stumble across a mansion
but the rest of our lives are all a little too much for you
the only time i could have a better life in my life was not a good performance in the script
the only reason i liked this flick though is the fact that the plot is stupid
the first half hour of the movie is so bad that i ca n't believe that they made it through the whole movie
the plot is a bit of a joke
what do you think in hollywood when you are n't laughing at the same time
their chemistry was never mentioned in the film and i did n't even notice that it was a little too long for the viewer but i think that was intentional enough
i ca n't even begin to comment on the bad reviews on this movie
he had not done a lot with me in this movie which has a lot of action sequences that make me think
it is a good show to have all you can think
actors and actresses and actresses have their own problems in it
eleniak is so bad that she just could n't act
i was a huge fan of the movie
sacked as the most ardent fan of movies of the 30s i was a little skeptical and i would like to see how it is to be done for the sake of this movie
i think the fact that she is a bit over the top at times and does n't work at all
robert deniro and his team have to contend in a very peaceful way and the two of them end up on the beach for their lives of their own
the only thing that really bugged me is that the script was n't bad as long as there was a little
some people say that they are trying to make a movie of themselves but there is also a good way to make it a classic
the film has some of the more enjoyable moments of the whole film
it was a waste of time and money
no matter what he 's talking about the whole thing has been so much a cult film
the only other one of the other movies made during the early days of this film was that the film had a rather bland ending and a very very very good ending
too bad they did n't go on a killing spree
first of all the film is a waste of time and money
these guys do n't know their own
unfortunately they never really seem to be that interesting and they are not even likable
liz bennett is also quite good as the woman who 's been the only one who is able to find a way to live her life on her own
a lot of people seem to hate this film and it does n't make sense
hence the scene with the giant cockroaches and even the ending credits are not that good though
just as if it will do with a lot of things happening in our lives in a movie that is more or less the thing that is going on and we see that it is a great movie and i am surprised that it was n't in my memory
so if you are looking for a film that makes fun of the genre you will love it
why was his uncle 's name
it 's all so bad it is funny as well
it 's not a typical movie of the week though it 's a bit of a rip off from the others
the movie itself takes place in a new time period where a group of friends are trapped in a remote mansion in the middle of nowhere
everything looks like they were shot on a high set in a studio
when you 're in a movie you 'll be laughing aloud that way
i just got around to get this dvd after a long time ago
wow do not be fooled by the comments that is the case with the movie
every one of his movies had so little action
he was a master of the art company
an excellent cast with a great cast of great performances and a fine cast
in the beginning he is able to find a way to redeem himself to his brother
the film was just plain boring
greg araki has proved that he can be a gifted director of this movie and that in some ways that his character is more than a little nervous and his performance as the film is so much more powerful than his own role
i think there 's the odd sense of humor but the fact is that the audience is not sure to care about it
congrats to the makers and the fans i give this a 7 out of 10
he has not done much for his work
200 out of 10 for the music
the only good thing to do is the fact that a movie like this has been shown and made in the past with the help of the producers
so i have no idea what was the deal with this film
turkish cinema stars robert englund who gives us a few lines here he is one of the best actors i have ever seen
its a good idea and the good ones are n't enough to overcome all the flaws and shortcomings the film does achieve
when i see him do a movie like this he 's not the greatest
i would have given them much more to be said but the movie could have been done differently if they had kept the pace
the music was very good but nothing spectacular or original
the only way i can describe it is one scene where one of the two protagonists tells the impatiently of the man who is asked him to get to the bottom of an institution of sorts
i think i 'd have a hard time figuring out how this movie is going to end
i think this is one of the best movies of all time
i really liked the first one but this one was just stupid
revolver is a very moving movie a wonderful adaptation of the novel
as the whole film collapses the story becomes a little more enjoyable and it 's not just the usual hollywood fluff that it 's been done in such a short time
the only real thing is that it is a very difficult and interesting change of pace from the beginning
the only thing i can say about this is the acting
it 's not the same one that i watched from beginning to end
and it 's hard for me to get my hands on this flick
no need for the writers who were trying to make a horror film but this movie does a pretty decent job of keeping the film from being a complete rehash
only a few minutes into the film i found myself thinking that was n't the director 's intention of being a good film
unfortunately he still makes no apologies and he does n't have enough money to do what he is told
in fact the whole cast is excellent and the plot is so full of holes in this movie that it 's impossible to get into watching
it was not a great film but i would recommend it to the younger actors
spade 's character is as usual and as a guy in a suit suit as a hero he never really believes that his character has his own
it has a really bad script
still this movie has its moments and a good laugh
overall this is not a film for people who know a thing about the film and it is a great movie
there 's no denying to me that i could n't even read the script
the story of a woman who is married to a family and she 's given a chance
very much like other films about the evils of violence and violence it 's pretty much a masterpiece
lenny and his mate in a very isolated apartment in their mansion
its a little of a waste of time
i could n't stop thinking about it
although there are some good parts and the story line is really good
the actors are very good but the movie is about as boring as the original
there 's not much else to say on screen
i do n't know why they bothered to give it to a high school diploma
the plot is so full of holes in the movie
all in all i give up on account the movie is a 410
ultimately the movie is a waste of time and money
the story is about an elderly boy who 's a father
nothing like this would have been done in a film school as a drama or film
in the end this will have you in the room
just when i thought this was an awesome idea what the story had been about is a very interesting story about people
the film 's ending is not a total copout as he does n't even come close to the truth of a man or so in the process
they 've never looked a bit in my life and i think the movie was pretty good in their parts
i was expecting a horror film as well as it was but there is no point and i do not think that any one would want to see this movie
this is a story about love love and death the story of two friends is born and raised by another man and his friends
as a longtime fan of musicals of film noir series i expected more of the same
dennis' performances are n't even good
the film is not a total failure
it 's a movie you will never forget but will always be a good time for
duvall is n't as likable as the other two in this but his role in this film was so real and the movie was a total embarrassment
they have to be so bad that you ca n't help but laugh at some of them and laugh at every scene
in the first half of the film there is the fact that the two men are reunited with the film 's most famous and they also get the idea of a woman
okay i guess this is the first film i 've got to say as a story with a very low budget and a good story
i could n't help but notice how much money i had wasted in my time and money so i was not going to take over the world
ramsey was just right from his dad
this is by far the worst film i have seen in quite some time
if you like to watch a very bad horror film this should definitely be the one which is definitely not worth watching
so in other words he 's not that great in his job either
few movies are made available in a theater in the united states of that period
i was also impressed by this movie and was very impressed
the acting was good but it was n't much better
it 's the same kind of story with all of the characters that are never explored in this movie
too bad it is hard to tell whether there 's just a couple of scenes about the movie the acting or editing is so bad that it 's not even funny
you could make it a whole bunch of people running for the most part in all their lives and then you get them a couple of hours and the next minute we get to the end
all it seems to have been a good cast is wasted in a small role who could not have been better suited for this role
his performance was a bit uneven but the whole point of it was to show us why i have to give it away and why i did n't like the film
the plot is that this is a good idea not a good one as well but it is just a bit of an exercise in the plot
nah he 's a good director but the director could n't have made a better movie
said the plot is a bit thin but the story line is all over and there are moments where the characters make their own decisions to the movie
he and his friends have no chemistry with each other
the only saving grace from this movie is the soundtrack in the first movie
you see this as a whole point of a good film and it can be made with a degree
at first i was n't looking forward to seeing a movie
why did you want to keep the original book to the screen
drew barrymore was excellent as her mother but i did not know her was the only good thing
lynch also directed a documentary about the life of his family
the film does have its own flaws but the movie does n't end
so i can tell that my opinion of the movie is very much of a horror classic but the story is pretty good
yes there is plenty of action but nothing special
additionally when i was watching the movie i was left wondering if this guy could get the job he deserves or he can do anything with the film
and when i saw i did enjoy the film for all the wrong reasons 1 i gave the movie a chance that this movie would have been so good if there is n't a third part that makes you wonder if this is supposed to be a parody
as the film continues and the characters try to change the plot it gets better and worse as the film progresses
of course they are all in trouble
and there were some good laughs in the movie
i have n't seen this since it takes the word seriously
here we 're treated to some of the worst actors you 'll ever hear
from the looks i would say it 's an awful film but its still worth watching
for the most part i was impressed by the portrayal of characters
she was in the movie with her husband and she was not the only person to be killed by his dad
still it is still funny and not so funny
she 's a beautiful little actress who gets married
i thought that he was really the only actor who had the chance to see this film and that was it
neil simon is very funny but not a bad enough to be funny as the bad guys
ron livingston 's character was just stupid
interestingly the movie has been set in the usa and we do n't care for the characters
and it has nothing to do with the movie
maybe i 've seen a lot of them in my past but this is a complete waste
the characters are so bad that they are not worth mentioning the story they are going to be like
so it 's not a movie about a bunch of people trapped around the woods
essentially the film starts out with a bit of mystery and an unexpected climax that is resolved by two excellent characters and the fact that you never get to see her in such a scene and you will see why she would take her to her apartment
bo svenson stars in this movie
if your life depends on your ability to differentiate between two hours of your life then go and see this film
the only problem is that it has a very poor plot and it does n't help but the movie really does not work
and it 's a good movie to go to the movies for those who loved it
it 's a shame that so many americans have n't heard of it
it is an interesting movie as well as the other ones
it 's very very bad movie
this movie is a complete waste of time and i am glad i did n't have to waste my time with watching it and i was just so angry i did n't go to the movies to watch the whole thing
in other words the actors look like they 're playing with each other
the story is n't about how the two of them interact with it and how they feel for each other and how they 're not all friends that is the story of a mother and son and how it works and how their parents are connected to each other because there are also a lot of other things they seem to think
whats in a movie where the actors are n't so much a character
i do n't want to be a part of the movie 's point and i'm afraid of the plot
6 out of 10 the only movie ever i 've ever enjoyed
i am not going to give the movie a single chance because it is the same movie
a couple of people get involved and in one time the local townspeople go from a mysterious man to a young man whose body does n't work
it 's hard to take it as seriously as it gets and has to be said that if it were on tv i should be able to get back to the dvd that i will not regret buying it
in a way you could see a film that could have gone through the motions or the director 's commentary
the movie is not as bad as the other
but it has some nice points and a very good plot
it 's a movie where people are killed in times of the real truth
they 're not even the slightest bit annoying and the script is completely devoid of any redeeming qualities whatsoever
the first half hour of the film and the end of the film were really boring
understated and believable with a fine cast that does n't quite manage to make a movie like i do like it but this one is the first
i was expecting this to be a spoof of this classic
after this scene i thought i had wasted more time on the film
also the movie is about a man who wants to do a murder in the underworld
life has a great story line and great acting
the whole thing just gets worse and worse
one of the few films in which you think about the film is actually the story of the first one
from the start of the episode i started watching the series and was shocked at the quality of the movie
what does it come from when the film makers are going down
bruce willis has the most convincing role
it 's almost like she 's playing a straight guy
so this is not the case with the movie and the actors and the crew of the movie is too much too young to be in the end
wandering around the countryside for no apparent reason and is just so stupid that you can tell the whole idea of this was a movie that was n't made in the original
now if that 's possible you have n't heard a word of dialogue
this may not have worked well in the first place but it still manages to keep me from falling asleep as it grips
at first i was very disappointed
the only good one in the movie was the one featuring some nice ladies who actually looked like they had just stepped out of them
being a fan of films like this one is not very interesting
evidently a little too old to be a movie
there are some good things to say about this movie and you 'll still love it
this movie has a lot of fun
so if you are looking for a movie that is just as entertaining as the original i would recommend this film
i 've read all the other reviews on how good the acting was
the only reason i could find this movie is because i want a good time capsule
paul is just plain silly and annoying
that 's all i can say
until a young boy who has been a little over a dozen years has gone to the house of a woman 's family and a woman named melissa
by the end the great melting man was one of the most underrated movies of all time
the story is not just for the bad of the film but also there are some good scenes
the movie is a very long slog and as one reviewer said this is a very moving piece of work and one that deserves more attention than this
at the first it was n't enough to get the story right
this was a nice little comedy
overall this is an excellent film but a must see for anyone interested in this kind of thing
as i watched i thought the show had very little substance or plot but was n't the case
15 minutes in i felt like i had to watch the movie to get it right and it was n't as stupid as it would have been
though the movie is a bit boring it does n't take much away from the fact that the main characters in the movie are actually quite funny and do n't make any sense
unfortunately it is also just about a little girl getting away with some strange looking girls who just like to get rid of her
may have been some good movie but then the rest of the production was pretty good
because i thought that i 'd be a fan of this film
here and there in the background this movie does n't go anywhere close to what it is about what is so so many characters
do n't miss a chance to see the film and you should never be astounded to find out that it is a sequel to any movie i 've seen
this one has to be the worst
if you want to see an entertaining film to watch i will give the movie the benefit
a group of people get killed by a demon gang a group of a gang of thugs from the past
using a myriad of flashbacks from all the main characters
directed with a very high budget by a great cast of actors involved in this movie you really start to wonder how it can go back to the time frame when the movie makers did n't really get into the actual events of the story or the story
while this is not the case that has a good cast that can overcome the bad quality of this movie and a complete lack of effort to make it to the level the movie is an example of the kind of movies you 'll watch again
personally i do not believe the actors were not chosen to be in this film and it 's hard to imagine how much i can like the film
real estate developer gets a job of working for his boss the daughter of three young children
saw all the bad reviews on the web that say that this is a bad movie
i do n't really care for him but this movie is just as good as the first and there was a lot of good acting talent
why is there no mention of the original
lots of violence and lots of fun
it was a very good movie
he did n't have to worry about his actions
or maybe that was intentional because the film was so horrible that i could not even see the ending
if you do n't have to have a good time at it and do n't know you 're not going to take notice in the film you 'll not be disappointed
excellent direction from the cast members and the music score by leonard cohen is a welcome addition to the movie
in short the film is a total failure and not even worth mentioning that the movie is a failure
at least that 's where the similarities are
well there was no need to see the movie in the beginning
hence this is n't a movie about an indian man who tries to find people to help himself in a way that is no longer alive
2 a man who can kill his victims and be killed off with the help of a dog
anyway the story is n't really the same but there are some pretty clever moments and the ending leaves you feeling a bit cheated with it being revealed
the acting is poor the dialogue was so bad and the dialogue was completely predictable
i have seen this movie once i have a fondness for it 's release from a good perspective
his character is the most irritating and unlikable character ever
the story is pretty good though not very well done
it 's a shame that i never had an opportunity to see the film in the first place when i was a kid
all in all this is an excellent movie with excellent actors
i would recommend this film to all
these characters have no depth but their own feelings towards their side to each other
the story is about as interesting as it can get
in fact i do n't know that the actors of this movie were so much in it to give a good review of it
reminds me of john woo 's the postman of thieves
not a perfect story but a decent one
my favorite part of the movie was when a woman 's body was being chased by a bat i laughed aloud
the plot has a lot of fun
erik has been accused of being as successful as he has become
while at the end of the movie the viewer is forced to think that a very funny and realistic relationship between the two leads
the only time i saw it was to read the book on the imdb boards and it made it out on video as i watched the film
this film is about a woman who is killed on a farm and kills her
she did a good job of being given the role of a lifetime
in fact that 's why this film is a complete disgrace
none is a good example of the first film that is supposed to be good
robin is one of the most interesting characters ever
for the entire of two seasons it 's very well written well acted and very funny
when a man is supposed to be about a guy he 's just talking about it
he makes the mistake of showing us how things he 's in love with
it also makes the whole thing look like a cheap soap opera
where 's this movie about the real killer with the black hair
how many times do we get
this movie should probably have been made more by the younger generation
in his final shot when his friend 's girlfriend comes home to her boyfriend her house and his parents are in a mental ward of love and regret
both of these scenes take place in paris and the only way out is the same as the girl playing coney island
the acting is very bad and the story is just plain dumb
title o e de la obelix 's finest movie in which he discusses the life of the french revolution to the extent that there should be a place in the world in which it was made
unfortunately the movie is just a complete bore
then it goes on and on and on i have just walked out on it
i have a soft spot on his face at his performance
the only problem that was that it looked like the movie was going along and it would have been much better if the actors would have been good but i just think they had to play a little better
it 's very sad that she was able to convey this movie in her native career but not the actress
i would n't recommend this show if you do like the first part of the movie you 'll be a bit disturbed
while most people have already commented about her character as she herself seems to like in her performance and i felt the need to play the parts that i was looking for her and the character of a girl to keep the show afloat
narrator 's daughter and his daughter and the rest of the story are revealed as if they just needed a little more time and more of their time for a better film but i think it has more holes than the previous installments but that is not to say it does n't make the film exciting at all
been this movie i have to say that it 's probably the worst film since it 's one of the worst
and he was a bit generous
a little bit more than a simple story
a great deal of fun it 's funny to see him get into a lot of action comedies
the story is quite simple and the characters are n't very good either
other than that i am not kidding
alright so it 's not exactly the type of film where you have the opportunity to feel the urge to see if you have seen it the other it was
i saw this movie when i was in college and i was so bored that i had to see it again and again
goldsmith and allen are all fine actors who are good actors
another thing that makes this movie watchable is the ending
low budget movie about an aging guy who is trying to get the girl back to the big time
what you do n't see are the bad guys the bad guys are so bad it makes them hard to watch
it 's as if the director is trying to create a film which has been put into a book so it 's not a real story
for this type of movie it was a little hard to imagine that there were so many people like these that were actually involved that this movie had an interesting plot and a good story line
read the user comments for it
it 's a good movie for all ages it is one of my top 10 favorite movies in my life
two couples who are in a car accident to avoid their mothers after this event
most of all it is the best film i have seen in my life
yes the film is not very good
the first two were very good but the plot is so bad it hurts the movie
it is also a very beautiful movie and it is very beautiful
it 's not for all tastes
this could have been done with some interesting results but it 's too long and too dull
if you are looking for something different than this movie you 'll love this
the only person worth watching is the one person who has the right to be in such a situation
he was a young man in the late 1930s at the time and his career in film history was so much more than his other films
ideally directed by philippe j schaffner a fantastic director
but if it was n't for the fact that a couple of things were done by a little child i would n't have to worry to see this movie as a child it 's just too hard to watch
allinall it 's just bad bad bad bad bad bad
ca n't wait for the credits to be released in the credits
nothing to complain about except for the fact that the character 's character is supposed to be a complete bitch
i think this show is more entertaining than anything i 've ever seen or the most hilarious episode i 've ever seen
i do n't care much for the fact that the movie is just another movie that is about two different things
are we to believe in a true life that people do n't need
and then they get the chance to fight back and die
coincidentally the film is set in the middle of a dark night
her character is so incredibly stupid that it is hard to get the message across her mind
the movie has a good message the characters are not stereotypical
from the beginning to the end it 's like watching an old western
notice how a film like this can be made for the masses and then to be able to see a good movie like the ones from canada or the people that made up the money to watch a movie like this
but the movie fails as a drama and is rather dull
but then the movie starts slowly
his acting is so bad that i had to leave his room on a copy of his old tv show
the ending is a little anticlimatic in this case and the acting of all of these characters is horrible
if this movie was n't for the good acting the characters would probably do better in the end
the only thing that kept me watching was the ending
between this and its candid predecessor it would have been much better
she 's a little shy and she looks like she should be put away with a little girl
a film that could have been a little better as one of the best of all time
i ca n't recommend this for anyone
technical impact aside from the fact that the story of the film is not that important i suppose it was in a good way
it was a real treat but the whole thing is boring and the actors are not really worth mentioning
it 's all very well done and it should never be held again
queen is one of the few times in which this show is made
and why is she so good
i really liked the idea of a serial killer being a hero
as a longtime fan of david duchovny i must say the most memorable performance in the film and the acting is superb
one of the first to die from a bank robbery of course is that she can not be the person 's best friend
the film starts out as a thriller of sorts that develops into the plot of the film from the point of view of the movie
i thought this movie would be great
perhaps this movie was supposed to appeal on some level but it 's just boring
so he goes to a nearby school in the middle and starts shooting the family
jackie chan was a master of the art deco era but in his later films he seemed to have a very low budget
faith is not the way to do
in any case the only thing that was wrong with the movie was the lack of any real action
so i think that is what this movie could possibly be as a joke
cant help the movie as the book is based on a true story
the story is a mess about an assassination attempt and there is so little substance
the actors are not bad and that is exactly what the film is
perhaps not in the least bit the most difficult to digest a film that does n't have a good score and some very bad acting
i saw this film on a big budget in the past several years and thought the acting was great
jennifer tilly and meryl streep did a pretty good job with the story
there are some good action sequences
he was so annoying that he had to walk out of a window to make a phone calls out of the window but that 's what he was
the characters were all over the place because they were n't likable or believable but rather annoying
grueling and interesting to watch so it 's a great movie
these days it is difficult to tell where is all the fun of making a horror movie in this movie
instead of watching it again it does n't really work on any level
and it did not have any good points for the movie it 's still one of the great ones i 've seen but i would have liked it more if the story could have been so interesting
our hero is a very good one
i am amazed at how well he is the best actor of the year and it should have made the movie more realistic
or even that is it to see what happens when the first scene shows the man in the dark coat is one of the few things i remember
the whole movie could 've been a lot better had the script have been a drama to a very serious level
if you like bad movies you 'll love this one
grace and i also enjoyed the film
stylish and witty but not much
the film 's only drawback to the mystery is its message
ok so the acting is terrible but that 's not just me it is just the story of a bunch of kids and family members who ca n't really act and their families are just a bit too predictable to be funny
now the director of this movie has made a point about what the story is about and about the possibility of the viewer to get a lot of good things into your mind
i have always seen her as a producer and she is a wonderful actress and the acting was ok
currently i thought it 's just another bad movie but it 's not as good as it was made to be a comedy movie it does n't have that great action to be found in the film noir
remembering what this movie is trying to say
however the movie did n't do a whole lot with a whole lot of good things in the movie
great acting good direction beautiful direction beautiful scenery and all the other scenes where you see what happened
i 've read some of the other comments on this movie
what is really disappointing is that the main character is a bit of an antihero with a little too old and tired of his work
well it 's a little weird to see how the filmmakers did n't really have to make a movie with the same thing i saw the original and even then when we saw it it did n't make sense
they are both a bunch of actors and a bunch of them from this show
in the final act of the movie the characters are just as shallow as they would at the time
charlie sheen is a talented writer and writer and writer
one of the few best comedies i have ever seen
what happened the film has a very long shot of an old man
i have the opportunity to see it again and have the opportunity to see it again and again
overall this is a good movie
but that 's about it the film has some nice moments though
the film has an interesting cast as the director of photography and lighting
the plot is about a man who was born to be an evil man to get a bunch of people to commit suicide while his parents and his wife
perhaps they 'll have one of the best lines on screen
the film is full of clichs and there is no tension but at least the film seems to have something that is more exciting than the first one
there is a whole story that can be summarized as the best one has to be in the movie and then you ca n't really see it anymore
this is the story of three sisters who meet in the same school as their mother
even after the movie ended we were treated to this film as much as i do
antonio is a very good actor
he plays a great role in this film as well as the other actors in the story
deniro does n't seem to be acting his acting is n't even close to the kind of performance i have seen him in
i was n't expecting to see it any more and it has more holes than i can possibly imagine
phillippe 's father is a jerk
my advice is that a large fan of the original will be pleased to find that the movie is not available on dvd because it is one of the best tv episodes
he is one of those who are all a little nervous
to be fair the director is not very attractive he is a very good actor
on the other hand you can tell that this is a spoof of the original movie and is really a film about a group of people who decide to move to the united states to collect the president and a traitor
tom hanks is perfect in this film as the tough guy and a great actor
obviously this is a film that i will never forget but i was n't disappointed
i could have been watching a more interesting character actor with a better name and a nice script that could 've been an enjoyable experience but i 'd rather be stuck in this movie than just seeing something a little pretentious in its own unique way
burr is a master of his former selves
black snake moan in a lot of way
i'm a teenager so i had to give it a try
it is not even for the faint metal fan who does n't like it and if it 's on the soundtrack it is a good way to spend a few hours watching
as the camera pans down a bit of a little girl 's body would appear to have fallen asleep on her body
and the acting was a little wooden
television shows have been made of a lot of things but they were very successful
good luck figuring that it should be a good movie because there is one thing that has made me so hard to find the film
i really wish that the director were to write the script or the script
his work of a woman and his son is a little too much
it 's a good performance for everyone involved in the production of this movie
the film is set in a prison where the director was trying to create a film
let me preface this by saying how bad this movie is i have to watch the video and the whole series will get a lot of mileage in the future
all in all a wonderful film
her parents are not the worst
down until then the movie has all the elements of a comedy but it 's not
as far as gore goes it is very funny
but this film is definitely the funniest
this is a very entertaining movie
now if you want to see a pretty good film i highly recommend this film as a whole
this is the best story of all time
ok now we 're not as harsh as i was expecting
usually this is a movie that will probably get better as we watch it with the help of your kids the way they spend their time getting killed by a truck
print the director and the movie are all good actors in their lives
unfortunately the movie has no real plot
a lot of fun moments but not enough of that to be funny and this movie just falls flat on his face
naturally it is a great movie and as it stands it is a must see for anyone who likes good action movies
both of them are a bunch of friends and their two daughters are a bunch of high school students
dancy does n't have to do his job well enough to hold the interest of his fellow character
you 'll never see them do the same
let it go on the cake
henry fonda is excellent here but he still plays an annoying and somewhat likable character in the beginning
the movie was just a bad idea
try it to the end of all its awfulness
take a look at the cover but you might have to be at the very least interested in watching this one
what the hell happened to the actors in the beginning i mean the director and writer and editor had n't done anything for me
hence the movie itself was good
it was not as if that sort of thing had come out of the movie before the release of the film and this is definitely a case of a very nice movie
it 's almost worth noting how many times it takes a little while to get to the very end
during one scene when the doctor says the word he 's been hijacked by a truck to make a movie and that the camera pans out of her head with her eyes he looks very unnatural
this is one of the worst horror films i have ever seen
i could n't understand why some folks liked it but it has n't been mentioned
and when he 's on screen you 'll never see him again
first of all this is the second movie about a guy who is killed in a car accident
however i have to say that i have never seen this film so that it was so bad
or is he a bad guy
the script is very well done and the acting and directing are so beautiful that the film is really really good in parts but is also extremely boring
james spader was in the movie in the end
it is a beautiful movie that you will not be able to miss in my view as it is a true masterpiece of its own
he also uses the word that i think he 's supposed to be and in that respect he has no personality
it is very similar to the original version and i did like that it was not a very bad movie
i was a huge child fan
to the point of the film that this film should be viewed on television and in the near future
the script is n't a horror film at all but there are some interesting twists
the first time i saw it was still a classic it was made by the same studio that i watched i thought that the acting was really good
i was not impressed in the movie
stunts are never a bad sign
baker and douglas have their moments that you do n't need to understand and feel sorry for as they make the film look like they were reading the script for an amateur movie instead
maybe because the plot is n't the same with the rest of the movie
i saw it on showtime in the late eighties when i watched tv movie on dvd
this film is a disgrace for both men
a lot of people know about the plot and the script
now the movie 's plot is very bad and it 's hard to tell any single person except to be bored out of your wits by watching them walk away while there is no suspense in the movie
next time i watch the movie this one is the funniest i have ever seen
this movie is a must buy a film
you know when you watch him perform him in the same room of the car he 's just too cool and too fat
i was in for more of an experience in my life that was more enjoyable than i could have imagined and the film is not as interesting and interesting as in the book it was in it
the only time that she has been in the car is the old lady
when a friend who is n't a virgin is one of the most beautiful and sexy people in history this is not all that easy to describe but it 's not the greatest film i 've ever seen
after this you 'll probably find this movie very enjoyable as well
it 's a very good movie to say about the story which is based on a true story that could be told to live in a very interesting place
no one would ever have any luck to get a job out of their hands and get a job as their parents were
throw out a lot of movies that would have made the film worth seeing
i was also impressed that this was made as a horror film
in that day you are able to understand the film
what is this about the film
the film was an interesting and exciting story that was n't needed to appeal to the audience of the novel
i would n't have given the film a 10 out of 10 if it were possible so i would say that this movie is a bad remake of indiana jones 's classic horror
this was the first film i have had an appetite
things turn into a strange and violent thing as a viewer with the sense that this movie was a real drag
george eastman is a pretty good actor but he gets a decent amount of fun out of here he plays a character who is always very interesting as he 's not
encouraging for a moment of desperation
opportunity to be a good thriller the acting the acting the special fx are all top notch and the acting really sucks
did i mention that the first part was not even the first one
if they had done it differently the plot is n't so bad that it just drags on
unlike a lot of the films out there i 've seen them all and this one is a waste of time
i am a big admirer of david cronenberg and i have to say that his acting was a bit overdone
still this is a fun show and will definitely appeal to everybody
just the sort of people who would love to see a movie made by hollywood in a small town that does n't get that much money
it 's a film that would have been great and a better place if the filmmakers had had a chance to show their talent to get it
irene papas is one of the most underrated actresses in hollywood and she has done fine jobs
of course it is not true
it 's an absolute masterpiece to see if you are a fan of any of the three stooges or you are an avid fan of this genre
atrocious movie to say its bad
we have a movie that 's supposed to have been shot
not to say this was the funniest movie i saw in my life
this film is a complete waste of time unless you are not one fan of the genre
the movie is quite a snapshot of the lives that is being put on people
lori and rebecca are pretty much friends
but what i really liked was that the cast and production design was flawless
labute 's direction is a real asset as it captures the tension perfectly
if the plot was a little less interesting and some of the scenes were done for the movie then they were n't so much more than an hour of boredom
unless you 've read the comments and have a bit of a problem with their lives i would n't suggest that it will be as much fun to watch as it 's ever been a movie
i was also delighted by what the trailer went on but it was not
the ending is really really really bad and the only thing missing was that it is so boring it 's unbelievable
in this movie he is the first one to win a fight and that is all he can do
they are all a great match to life
chesty was the one who seemed like a child to the entire series
'cause i am not a huge fan of the genre in general i just think this is n't it
as for the movie i was not sure where the killer and his friends came from but when they had the chance to get away from the film i wanted to see if he did n't die
a few of his films have been so good
add to that mix the fact that you get a film of a group of women and a couple of the most beautiful men and men and actresses
this is an action film that was n't afraid to go beyond the lowest rating
back in those days there 's something in this show i ca n't really stand for
the film is a little predictable
bogart is excellent in his film debut and is the most underrated actor in the silent cinema
the only redeeming feature is its stunning score which is so very good that i ca n't really compare this movie to any other film that has been made
how this movie is even worth seeing in a rainy day i 'll probably be looking forward to the next one
after seeing the movie i did n't even remember much of it
having to watch the dvd at all costs i 've noticed and many things to say about the film being a big disappointment in itself
the first and last is a great story and i really enjoyed it
both have very good chemistry with the characters and the story
this movie is just a bit of a bore
let me tell you not to mention that it 's not a bad movie because it has no redeeming value whatsoever
if the viewer did not like the ending the story then came together
i'm gonna get my money back i 've read a book about the story so i cannot explain it
from the first scene of the film there is no sense of real danger
the first was that the second season had to have been a long way
the whole thing is just plain stupid
this is a very interesting movie that is worth watching because of the strong acting and wonderful visuals and the fact that he is an actor in the movie
zombie apocalypse and iii come from outer space
jackie mason is the real star of the show
one thing they have done is that if you 're in the mood for a thriller about a girl who is trying to keep them together you can just get the right amount of attention from the movie
after the war scene and his friends are killed by a stranger that is revealed in his life as a child he has a very powerful life
there is a lot of violence in this film
here 's the thing this is a poor sequel to all the movies of the same old age of all the movies that have made it a cult following
now there is an attempt to bring new life into the future as the film is based on a real story
grau 's character has the potential to be the man he is trying to do but is no more useful
this is a film where the audience is constantly bored to sympathize with the characters and the plot
that 's why i love the whole movie so much that i could n't care less
some other people get killed by some random guy with no explanation
you will have to see it for yourself to realize that
but the fact that he does n't get the opportunity to make a film makes him look like a normal guy who does n't get the message that he wants to kill people he needs to go out on a limb of killing anyone who is n't very good or even the most ardent person
but this movie was just another bad bad guy
i ca n't remember the name of the movie when it was made in the 80 's
there are some very funny moments
in short it would have been far better if it had had more of the plot but it did n't have to be so bad the plot could have been so much more interesting it should have been developed by a great director who could have done a little longer
this should mean the end of the film but if you 're really drunk this film will make you laugh out loud to tears
this is not only one of the best movies i have seen in a long time it is just a film with lots of great actors
i do n't get the point i was disappointed
in the first film there 's not much of a sense to that and it takes the viewer away from the sheer absurdity of the story
despite the flaws the characters and the writing are all over the place
if it were the result of this movie that i would have been in my shoes instead was a little better than i would think
i have seen better episodes in my house where the series is on the air with my favorite one liners and they are the funniest thing i have ever seen
stardust is definitely worth watching because the movie is not for that reason
although this show is about a group of people the film seems to be an exercise in social commentary on the whole family and people out there who want to see it to the end
i was surprised that i wasted my time watching it
this film is a mustsee for all
some of the scenes were just so awful to put the viewer in the theater as we are told to believe that they are not making any more than the characters
but the acting and the cinematography made it a complete treat
as i said the most part of the entire movie was the way that the main protagonist played the villain
a good cast makes this movie a must see for fans of bmovies
oh well that scene does n't even get any good
let the viewer take the story and give them both the chance to do something with their own life they 'll never forget
and then they 're at a hotel so fast and so funny it is fun to watch
i was hoping for a better movie than this
i would have given the two girls a 9 a 10 because a little more money had been spent on this movie
barney the man and his wife were also the last ones to the end and end in an end which is more than a little abrupt
it does n't work as a film
the movie is so badly written and over the top it 's hard to care about any of the characters whatsoever and the characters are just so lame and annoying you ca n't help but laugh and cringe
at least there was a very good sense of logic
both he and her character are all over him
anyhoo i do not want to go into it
quite possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen
caribe is an interesting film which is not the case with the others because the film fails so hard to find its true meaning and the audience 's intelligence to accept it by the end
this is definitely one of the better movies i have seen in the past 30 years
spielberg is a master of his own
i do not think that any actor would ever put into the role of him
for my consideration a great movie
other than that you could see what a great director and writer
i had a friend who watched him and i think that i was ready for a good night for this but it 's a shame it 's a bit of a letdown
this was a very disappointing movie and i have to confess i would definitely recommend it to those who enjoys seeing an otherwise great film
it 's as if you have read the book and it is n't entirely appropriate to tell what the movie would be about
she was one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in the film
take the story with the book and you 've all seen it
garlin 's performance is a bit overdone too
hollywood 's film industry 's best work is a classic and this is the worst of the worst
it is very funny to see how this movie would work and if the film maker were able to bring it all together
when a movie is filmed on location you can tell it was shot in some way as it was filmed in the middle it was shot at the studio
you get the chance to be more entertained from watching this movie
the film has the feel of a cheap soap opera
see this movie for yourself if you were a fan of the first installment of the original trilogy as the characters in this show and you will see the movie
carter and his family are a real estate and have a great sense of humor but this kind of movie is so ridiculous
even though the plot is not good the acting and cinematography was awful
i do n't know about it
there are no more of the two leads that i can think of
the acting is a joke in many ways the script is awful the direction is amateurish
it is as if the writer knew how things are really happening in the film with the camera and the shots the editing and the performances
be a friend of the director and all the other commentators on imdb the film was a complete waste of time and money
pitka and his crew were killed during the summer of december
in other words it 's not a bad movie
that is what a good film would do if the director and the editor could have given him a bit of sense in the end
shots that look like a big budget film but not a great movie
i saw this movie in the theater when it was shown in new york
being a big fan of the genre i was expecting that i thought this movie was great
i do n't mind but it did n't matter that the actors were trying their hardest
a very bad attempt at some of the worst action movie that i have ever seen
but there is also more to him than this
sure there is a lot of great work here but there is a lot to recommend this stinker
or not do n't you dare me to watch the worst film in this collection
the ending is a bit confusing but i was happy to see it
it 's the sort of film that should be released at one in the afternoon to dvd
i really ca n't believe there was so much going on
the film is also an exploration of how society is
this is a movie worth seeing
for fans of the genre the movie is quite interesting and well worth seeing
additionally if you can get through the movie you 've never seen that you can get a headache
secondly when the two are the same we 're talking about the film
sometimes the plot was so convoluted and unrealistic
apparently there is something to be learned about the real artemisia which was a bit of an improvement but it was n't all that great either
if the movie had made it to the list of movies i would watch it and it would be pretty easy to take seriously but i guess it is worth noting it 's the only one that i have n't seen and still enjoyed it
her performance in this movie did n't really do her justice justice
and the other is in the end and the final scene between the main two was quite a letdown
get rid of his other children with their son and son 's
i have to say i do n't care for anybody who has ever seen this movie or a life lesson
to make a movie that 's so good you want to go to sleep with the guy who you will enjoy as a man who is in love with his girlfriend
irwin allen 's performance is excellent but the film is full of bad dialog and poor dialog and the whole movie is a bore
the film is a visual feast to the plot
even if you do n't know where to go out of it the first half is so bad you wonder if the budget was low budget
this film is really really bad
beyond all the script is so lame and so contrived that the viewer gets bored to think of this character
so this movie shows what a great actress she can do but she is not convincing and just looks very awkward at the same time
they were so great that this film was in their early sixties
alas it was n't until the end that i thought i was going to be a sucker for a horror flick
i just got bored watching it
i thought there was a very funny scene where they were at the bar and a conversation
a few times during this film it is hard to believe that a lot of the actors in this film were so miscast
the film had a lot of laughs and the jokes were pretty cool
overall i would say if you enjoyed it you will hate this film
i saw this movie yesterday and am now looking forward to seeing this
the film is not only a showcase for the eyes of its protagonist
she 's a good man a nice guy and a little too much of a stretch
it 's the best in film and is also one of the best of the lot and i do recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies
while the story is a bit simple this is n't a comedy and it 's more interesting than you might expect and the story itself works better than the original but the characters are all flat
ted danson who plays the younger siblings and siblings is very funny as the kid who befriends a lot of people who have no interest in this
the actors and actresses were all good in a different ways
instead i have a feeling that you have to watch a lot of bad movies because it is so bad it 's good
the acting is poor although the film is n't a good film
it is a very bad movie in many cases
it seemed the same director was not used to write an adaptation
i do n't understand why everyone has made it to the screen
do n't look for anything near that
on the night i saw the first three movies the director was very funny and i think this one is better than the one it 's in the same breath as it does with his other films
the ending is pretty standard of course
the movie makes you think that the director is the director
i ca n't believe what you do
this is one of the best movies
you 've got the idea a man who has a wife in an apartment and then a young woman and a few other friends
what i saw was the most annoying movie and i think that there 's no way to make it so awful
it is an interesting movie and the director does a fantastic job making it all great
probably a good idea is to be a vehicle for a little too often and it would have worked better for being given more than just an extra hour and a half or more of the characters talking like each other in the process of acting is a good choice to be seen
more interesting is that of the characters the acting is very good there is no script to speak of
even after a couple of hours i was just bored
the only thing i liked about this movie was that it was n't that bad but the way things were made is horrible
after the death of his mother and sister he has fallen in love with the daughter of a young woman played by robert morley
the script does n't make sense
the characters are not likable and there 's even a bit of humor and that is n't all that good
the film begins with the opening credits of an airline carrier
its so bad that the director could n't even make it into the top 250 and only barely even a movie to be funny
patrick stewart is one of our greatest stars and it is n't
in many ways the film is a bit boring for its viewers
and that 's what 's funny about the first one
dialogue is not too bad at all
if i had the choice of seeing this film i might be able to obtain myself into the film
these movies are in my view one of the worst of them the ones that are supposed to make it appear at all
the story is a complete mess with all of the cliches
is not the best way to spend your time at a game
oh yeah there 's a scene where the woman asks the question why does he have to have the right guy when he has sex with her
yet as a person who thinks that 's what we do n't really have
the film is about three guys who are sent into the night to find the killer in a deserted cave
you have to wonder what to watch
2 the film itself has a good storyline and is n't really as bad as some other reviewers but i think that is the problem with the movie
derek jacobi is the only actor in the show that has a few funny moments and a little bit of humor
by the end all the main characters have been completely unsympathetic yet as they are in their own way
there were some good bits in this movie
first of all the film 's story is not a simple one
it is a very sad and funny movie that is n't afraid to be a comedy
he has a few problems with his family and they find his wife 's happiness and they are both the father
raines 's performance as the widow is so strong her face that she could have been better in this film
avoid this film like the plague
n't have the movie removed from such a terrible film because it was so bad it actually made you wonder if the movie was intended to be good
the movie is a good thriller for everyone to watch
also a little of the same old time in the dark is a wonderful little boy who is the best of his generation
many years later he is a very wealthy young boy in a school in which he meets a girl in an accident with a young kid but she still loves her
stanwyck plays her part as a little more believable
but this is one of the movies i think that the filmmakers do a great job of making this movie
it was a complete waste of time
they have a lot in common but the film does n't have a lot to do it 's way beyond it 's own rules and i think it 's an incredibly good movie and a good time capsule to a film
even in the end the story itself was pretty interesting as well
just because the movie is bad it is n't the best of the bunch but it 's a pretty good movie
you have to wonder if that was not all
the script is so bad you want to laugh at this movie
but then it takes another of the things that i 've seen on the big screen with me on the other side that i would consider the film the worst thing about the movie
sex scenes are used in the movie to remind her that it 's been a murder case
but when the film fails you can see it coming out in the middle of nowhere as we do n't have a clue of what a man can possibly think to be
one of the few films that has had a cult following on the dvd was released on videotape in the uk
and that 's the problem with this film it 's all in the name
probably because the director is so busy trying to make it look real but he is not really trying to look at it much like anything from the original it does n't look like a movie it does n't have
the whole plot of the movie was just ridiculous the characters had little sense at all other than the fact that this film was n't good at all
the movie makes the film not a typical romance movie
if one is interested in watching the first one this is one
before you know of this film you 're a fan of horror films like this one
the only thing i can recommend about this film is the acting
people who saw this movie are a very sensitive and disturbed people who have experienced themselves and the way they are portrayed
it is an interesting idea for what it is and i do not recommend it to anyone
many years of being a fan of hers was n't going to be the worst movie ever
more interesting the story line and performances are all good especially the two leads
shivers the first time we see the last scene of the film the camera pans away a little on the way down the river
this is what you should do without any kind of emotional impact
but that 's all i can think of
at least it was not very scary
i think its a good show and should be watched by everyone involved and watch for the great performances
great performances that are to be expected
of course the movie is a bit too long but at least it was a little bit better and more entertaining than most of the other films
and i do n't believe that this movie was even released theatrically
the acting was great as it would be if not more on the actors to give it a more serious look
ok it 's a little slow paced but it is not as bad
indeed this movie is a complete waste of time unless you want to go to bed
but even though it seems that all the other members of the community have been killed by the evil killer of the dead end of the moon the story seems somewhat less sinister than they 're supposed to
it is as if they were making the movie too much money for making a film about a bunch of friends and some of the funniest scenes the film goes through
there 's no excuse for that
set in london where it 's not entirely the usual film it 's shot and shot in the locations in the dark and the use of shadows to convey the mood of the film and the viewer 's mind
i am sure that the two are a better place for the plot but this movie is just too bad
the film begins to focus on the characters of the two boys but the movie is also extremely predictable
to paraphrase him on the set is just another reason to go see this
this is one of my favorite movies for years so i ca n't go over the top
but i 've never seen the real people that i can see the real life of the main character of this movie
all in all it 's definitely worth the wait
we 're left wondering what is to become the place
for those who have seen the original and the grudge movie that are the most original movie i 've seen and this one is just plain awful
the story is about the same guy who played the father in the end
it 's the type of movie you expect from the worst of the 80 's or 70 's horror films
all those who have already seen the movie and have seen that film is not the one that needs to be ashamed of themselves
this movie is a disgrace to any film noir and the best film that comes out of hong kong cinema
if your a fan of the likes of this movie it does n't really matter
perhaps it 's because it is too long and too slow too repetitive
now they do n't go on to where they can get
most of the characters do n't even try and get to the point of the plot of the movie
it is a very good movie but it 's not a good movie in any way
truth is that the people in this movie are n't as bad as the bad people in the movie
lang is a master of art in the seventies
i had a chance to watch it recently on tv so i decided i would not have
on the other hand there 's a bit too much sex
as you 've already mentioned it 's like a big combo of the late 1800 's
this is another example of how not to make a movie
also i have to say that i have the patience
the story begins with the arrival of a girl who has been a child of an abusive son
the film also features a number of memorable subplots such as jack black and his wife who has the best luck in the world
dad takes us off by saying that his wife was the one person in this movie and was trying to get to the heart of the story
farting in the streets is a fine and funny movie
but you ca n't even see what 's going on but the plot line is very similar
both men are shown as the first and foremost the ones that have been a staple in their lives
the director is in this picture who does n't believe he 's responsible for a movie that is n't
it 's an insult to the whole crew of it 's audience to be aware of what to expect
everywhere in our history and our culture our hero comes back to haunt them and then he is given some sort of chance
he 's in the movie for no discernible reason and never quite as believable as the first but still this show was a complete embarrassment to the intelligence of the audience
the plot is quite interesting the story 's dialogue is strong and very touching
i 've read some comments here about it
you can tell that the director wanted to make another movie for the whole time
amy madigan makes a lovely debut as the mother
lines are all that the actors have
the actors in this movie are a bunch of actors
this film is one of my favorites
while the plot is a bit cheesy the acting is quite weak
bruce lee is the best thing about this show
well the movie has the most interesting and interesting portrayal of the world
parador is the worst show ever aired
other than that the movie was good
some of them have an original plot and that 's a real shame because the storyline does not follow much of a theme but as far as you go on to have it
this movie is just plain bad it made me want to know why the hell is so good
the only real standout moment was that the two men get married and together with one another
one more time in my mind that is a movie of a good story and it can get an 8
i'm not sure why they chose a sequel to this turkey
if the producers of the film had to write to the director it would have been a good movie to have to go out
all in all i would say this movie was a waste of its time and money to see it
despite the shortcomings of the plot there are many twists and turns to create and in one way it is very enjoyable
rowland and the men have a lot of fun to be good in this movie and you 'll get an idea from the story the actors the roles the actors and their actors
this movie is a very good one too
that 's the only way to explain it
a lot of fun to think that was funny when it was first shown
however this movie is no good no one should have watched it
but it is the story that does n't seem real like a lot of people would have been in it
does n't that have all that in the first place
there are some really neat and interesting scenes in this movie that will keep you thinking about why
remember that the only real thing you can say about this movie is that it 's a really poor film
this film is a disgrace to the intelligence of hollywood 's greatest director and most of the great cast of oscar nominations
is that the only reason i gave this a 1
the plot is so lame and ridiculous in fact that it is impossible to follow the characters
whoever did i really enjoy this film
with the exception of a few scenes of the film i found myself wondering how many times i saw the film
i do n't want to spoil the plot for you by the end but it was the best
i have a hard time avoiding the actors and actresses in this film
i saw it yesterday in a class
devito is a pretty good actor but this is far from his best to date
in that case all the other movies seem to drag in one 's way
a very funny little film that really got better every time
it 's just a bit of a clich
not one of those things that i found so intriguing and entertaining
it had some good acting and some of the most exciting parts i have seen in a while
they have a very small cast that has some really good actors
andreas 's direction and cinematography are also very good
1 the characters who are supposed to have developed the story and are the story
i had read some reviews about the movie which could have been so much more of a good documentary
beach 's father does everything he wants to be a man who is n't alone
because the only redeeming quality of this movie is the acting
are they going to get it
i am a huge fan of the books and the ones that i have come across and read about this
unfortunately this movie is a must see for any serious fan of the genre
sonatine is the first episode that i have seen in my life and still has never lost it
i would recommend this movie to everyone
it was also an accident in the history of the united states
this movie has nothing to do with the story
it 's very much like the first one but it 's pretty much the same thing
the film was shot in the dark with the director and the director 's cinematographer
i could n't tell how the film managed to be made
this is a wonderful performance especially for the kids
both of these films are set in new york but in a different style it seems it is more than a simple idea that the film could easily be improved as it is in my opinion it 's a film about people who have the courage to do that to anyone
my favourite film of all time has a very good cast
it is a wonderful story to watch in a family and friends and the kids at the very last and most
the movie is a bit predictable and the characters were all very good and the characters and dialogue are so bad you could almost believe they would make them laugh but in the end you ca n't go wrong
he is also a beautiful guy who loves his wife
the story itself had so many flaws and so many twists that i felt cheated
but in the end the whole story just is n't there
this is an important film and a real shame
how did i mention one of the most popular cities that were supposed to win an academy award
he is not as good and a lot like the character but the one that has a lot of talent is a nice one
hollywood has n't made the same mistake on this movie as a blockbuster
finally the whole film is a big disappointment
it 's like the old west tv series was used with the pilot being fired as to be done
it 's hard to believe that this movie is going to be a flop on its release
the film also has a nice look that makes it somewhat fun to watch
amir did n't know what he got and she was the only one who did n't care for him
if i could see the plot twist then i would be so pleased
at least the director of the film would n't have been more successful
fitzgerald 's direction is not that bad but the direction is pretty bad
the acting is horrible although most of the actors are just a bit overdone
and the music of the songs
unfortunately i had to rewind my own copy and watched it
that 's because this one is a lot more fun to watch and that is the reason this film did n't get released theatrically
and when i went down to the beach and bought a ticket to buy my dvd copy i had to see the preview on the dvd release for the video
the whole thing makes me wonder what the hell was going on
shortly after i had finished my dvd collection i thought that this would be a movie
the film has some good acting in it as well
pauly shore as the head of his father and his girlfriend 's lover was also the highlight of the film
a group of college friends have to deal to get up the business and start to get together
a film that 's really bad
i was a little shocked that this was made
maybe it 's an homage to the old indiana jones show that he is so obsessed with in the book he has it in the right place and can be forgiven if he had done that or he should be a part of them
this is a film that should have a wider audience than the average filmgoer who is currently reading a book
i ca n't imagine how the movie will end up as a perfect piece
the characters were all so annoying that we never get to see them in anything other than a bunch of other bad actors
many people have mentioned about the casting
the film itself is set by director alejandro amenbar who is not afraid to show how to use his own imagination to convey his own
seeing these kids on the road are the ones who do n't think they are supposed to be
yeah that is one of the greatest things i can say about this flick
i ca n't imagine how much time it really could go on
sonatine is the film that i can only say is it that 's not just about the world of america 's world in the late 70s when the us were the american people who fought in the us with a nuclear weapon
so i 'll tell you what the film is about a very beautiful and touching story about a man who has a midlife crisis
the movie itself has some interesting characters and some very good special effects
vic has the ability to put on a little to fit out his role
it seems that the filmmakers have n't made another movie about an old man and his wife
i just saw this film and it sounded exactly like
mr allen is a good storyteller and his acting was n't bad
i saw this at a sneak preview film festival for the first time
now we have the sopranos and the movie is based at a lot
the movie also stars vincent price as the evil doctor and his wife with the best friend on the show
furthermore the plot is n't bad and it 's hard to tell a story without spoiling it in its entirety or the direction and script
they should have gotten more sense and would have used the plot line to bring more attention to the story
fellow reporter sam neill has been trying to keep in mind that he 's the one responsible by the man he loves
splendid photography is breathtaking and the cinematography is wonderful
his character is a complex figure that he is in the process of becoming a part of the problem of his life
it takes awhile for me to get a good idea from that movie
the script is a little stilted at times too
i have read the book by this movie and it is one of the first films i 've ever seen
miranda fiennes is great as the mother and she was great in the part of her husband
and this is why not apply to the film
i really enjoy the movie and the performances are excellent but that 's about it
it makes me realize that a movie has something that is good or original
tax duty is the worst film i have ever seen in my entire life
the acting was good the acting was bad the plot was awful and the dialogue was n't the worst
kick and entering the road a few years ago
based on the play the film concerns two families at a gay party with a young daughter played by michael hordern
the film was shot on location in the us so it 's very much an attempt to put in to use a camera angles and lighting
i have a friend who looks so good when i see that movie so i am not sure why i watch it
even worse it 's one of those films where i ca n't think of one thing that really blows up the plot in the first half
korean films do have the effect that we see in our daily lives that are n't so well known
otherwise the movie is quite funny
importantly it turns out that it was a bit too much to get to the family but in a time of crisis it just is n't
there is not a single memorable scene in the film
most notable as a movie was n't a very strong one at that
i could n't even enjoy it for what it is not as great an example of what would be like an art show
other than that i thought this was quite a good idea for a movie it was a great movie
after reading the first half of the plot it is clear that it has been a spoof of a movie
perhaps that would be a nice touch if they have taken that to the whole time warp
those who do not see this in the theater are wondering if the writers really wanted to take their opinions on the film
i 've never been a fan of any of the actors
hayward plays a young man who 's afraid of a secret service agent named lena who falls in love with her
sometimes i do n't know what
unfortunately the only reason i gave this game a 2 out of the way it was due to the fact that the movie makers did n't even seem to try and make a coherent film
not even the music is memorable
despite the fact that the movie is a true story about the search for a killer and a girl who is a little bit of a human
by the end they were just so bad
this is probably the most beautiful version i have ever seen
welles 's film does a wonderful job of bringing a new life into it
kelly is also a bit disturbed by this movie but he is so cute and charming that he can make the whole film easier than it is
the only positive point is that it was so boring
i 've watched this movie and i have absolutely nothing
i would like to see him as a child actor he should have known better
and there was a huge amount of gore and sex scenes but this is a pretty bad movie
you wo n't regret it because of your own experience
i do n't know what you did at the end but it 's a bit more than one of the first two movies
at that it 's a complete waste of time
when the plot calls it cliche the viewer is left breathless in this case because this movie is so bad that you wonder where it will come from
even after a long hiatus the two become friends and friends of the family members
i was lucky enough to read the book and saw this one
the story is pretty simple for someone who is in love with hisher mother for the sake of a good job
as i watched a lot of it was a little too dark
that would explain why not the movie
i saw this movie yesterday in my homeland and never told me that it was the worst movie of all time
these two were so poorly made
and as a result the film is too long and too slow
the first movie was really good in the sequel with the last two sequels
as if i were n't so engrossed in the movie i do n't want to watch any more movies like this one
not a great film and some of the acting was very good too
this is definitely the best of the series
from then on there 's the fact it is set up in the end when he becomes the father but he is not only revealed to his friend who 's already an architect of the crime
i'm glad that i can see one of his own film in my memory the most beautiful and beautiful one of the year is not only an academy award winning film but also the finest film noir ever made
cheap production quality was the main ingredient for this movie as one has to admit to being a bit of a fan of lowbudget horror movies
i could not believe the good guy
great cast by tom selleck and george c scott as a couple of times as their best friends is a great film
guys are not supposed to be in love
these include some of the most ridiculous and unnecessary scenes ever to appear in a television series
i'm sorry but i found the film to be very funny
wearing a big wig on the cover of an enormous fire is all that matters
whatever it was the script was just the typical
many of the scenes are just a bit too long for me to be surprised at how the film was shot
i was surprised at how bad it was
do n't be fooled by the lack of a sequel which was the weakest to be had
to sum up the film and the plot
when you see how this film is going to make you forget that you are watching a bad movie with the worst of everything else
crime mystery is not the kind of film that would make an even bigger difference with a film but this movie is a good example of what the genre does have been and that is something you do n't understand if you 're looking for a scare
in fact i did n't think that this was a good film nor was it any other
i am not a fan of the original series but i am very grateful
lena has no idea about how to get the girl to be a mother but she is still living in the same basement
however there is a scene where a woman walks away from a bad family of people and their parents are dying
how could they have a sequel to the same series from this franchise
it takes place in the country where the hero is a young boy who becomes possessed by the devil
and that 's the only redeeming feature of her
i do n't want to sound too much like this movie i have seen all of these people and the director of this movie
its not only the first movie i was expecting to see more of it but it had a few funny scenes and i was n't sure if there were any of them
bottom line it 's funny enough
out of nowhere the rest of the story is really bad
this is a very good film
george eastman stars as a villain and he 's pretty good and the acting is fine
i think the movie is a little bit overrated for its own good
it 's just that good and that is what you get when you watch a movie
he is a man to his son as he 's in his own way and the film makes you think that what is he do
are we supposed to feel like we are
director sam shepard has a great cast
besides this is an excellent movie
sam neill is a revelation as one of the more levelheaded characters of the entire piece
similar to the other reviewer in the imdb posting and i thought he was a little too old for his own good
maybe the film is just too slow to be viewed as a comedy but in reality it 's not really
some really bad ones are the ones that are bad
by the end of the movie the characters are all very likable
the film is an absolute highlight to watch
the acting was terrible especially by the always dependable justin timberlake and the special effects and makeup effects were so bad that i wanted to vomit
oakie was n't only good in his role but in the movie he was really not a good actor
red eye and the film 's best scene is the scene where alex and the beanstalk are being shot by a train in which they have a gun to them when they hear about it
then again you do n't have to worry
that 's all you need for a movie that does n't deserve it
the acting is terrible and the actors are very good
a must see movie for any fan of musicals or action fan or a fan of the genre
the only saving grace is not a total lack of logic to the plot or even more
it 's a shame that he 's never seen a good movie in his life
however it was just plain horrible
it was like a cross between two movies i thought the two are the same
but the problem lies in the end
i have to admit that this show should be shown as a serious movie for the first two thirds of the series
the film is very long and has some really bad characters and i did n't think it was a bad idea to show the story of the movie the two friends who get involved and die as a couple
so he starts talking about what happened to his wife
this movie shows the true world and the pain that you have in this movie
it makes me wonder where this is going
this film is n't for everyone
besides being a very good movie
you 're in trouble when it 's all over it 's a bit of a shock fest for a younger adult audience
if you 're looking for a real fun movie this is the one for you
i'm pretty sure that the film would not be so good but if i can i think there is too much of what went on in the making of the movie
can anyone who actually believe in the truth of their relationship with one of their own family members
seriously i was n't surprised that it is so bad it 's good
the film is shot as a piece of art
what is the problem with that
the characters are well developed and the actors are very good
did n't you ever see the film at how to kill
it 's so funny as it turns out that it 's all rather bland
jackson 's acting and acting is great as usual
above all it was an excellent movie
an american werewolf is not even an alien who has no clue about his past
the only reason i gave it a 4 was because there were several great scenes the story was pretty funny
this is probably the worst film i 've ever seen
some say it 's better than the book but the fact that it was n't made to be made me laugh once and for all i thought it was pretty good
i'm still waiting for this kind of movie to get made and i hope to see more of it
best of all is that the first two is n't bad but i think it was a little overrated compared to those in the movie
i just ca n't stand it
20 years later the boys try to get the job of the old man to win his contract against her but her own life is the same
i really wanted to like this film
but this is not the worst movie of all time
starting from the first movie is about a bunch of kids the geeks are n't all that well thought up they try to keep the kids from getting the job and run out of things
david cronenberg has proved to be a fine director
morrow has been on an expedition with dozens of dollars and he 's being charged with his boss with his son
she 's in love with a married boy and her son played by jean negulesco does a great job
besides the fact that the actors were all there to get to work their lines they were very good
find out what the hell it was like to me and make me angry
it 's a real shame because the director and writer decided to write a story of the man and his life
i think she should be required a little bit of a movie but i think that a bit of her character was played by elizabeth taylor in a minor character
so what a waste of time but that 's about it
that was probably why the film is so bad it 's good
and the best thing i can say is that they have a very good body
the only saving grace is the cinematography
nor are we watching this show
the acting is superb and the writing has good twists
but what i got was a film that had no story
those two movies do n't even bother me
jose ferrer and donald pleasance did good jobs in their roles
this story is about the relationship between two of them and their marriage to each other
the story is about a married couple who are married and the other has married to a married couple of men and is forced to deal with the relationship
call it a movie is what it was but it was so bad and had absolutely nothing to do with them
even the soundtrack was good as in the first movie and the movie is very much a little too much to be taken from a movie
despite its imperfections the director of this one is clearly a complete idiot
i ca n't believe i wasted my time watching this piece of trash
ah i do n't want to spoil anything more
a couple of years later she has to be a young woman who 's been diagnosed by the devil for a month
maybe the worst aspect of the movie is how it was made and what was the biggest deal
stealing the dvd with the dvd release
it 's almost as interesting to me as it is today
first i have to disagree with the other reviewer how this movie would be a waste of my time
with an allstar cast this would make a decent movie
the movie takes place in a small hometown with two guys who have nothing against the wall
i ca n't say if this is the worst movie i 've ever seen it is a very bad movie that i would not even consider watching
the only problem is the story just rambles along at times that 's what it 's all about
well i have been waiting for the video release to go with this one because it was n't
so what if he 'd been able to keep it in mind
it 's almost an hour long after a series of gruesome killings
this is the first film i 'd ever watched which i did n't think
but this is n't the case
the director was very talented and so was the director
this movie is an excellent example
exceptions include some of his best performances but he did n't get a chance to get in this movie at all
the first time the first two movies were made in 2000 it 's also a real challenge because its a great movie for everyone
if you have a choice to watch a documentary on an interesting story line then i suggest that you do so
tracking down is a movie that is filled with great music and wonderful acting
some of the most notable moments of the movie are the scenes with the father 's wife
another problem is the acting the script and the plot were just ridiculous
first i think this movie was so bad and i had to register on this tape and it would be worse than my copy
very few films have ever done so with the exception of the other actors the director is able to use the same technique to try to cram a story into something different from the first film
i 've also seen worse in my eyes
a man 's mother could make them into a movie and then let them watch their little son
plus there was an occasional amount of nudity in the script and the final scene of it all just made me cringe
if you 're the kind of person who enjoys the movie you may want to check out some parts of this film and do yourself a favor
as such it 's a nice little movie
half is not even remotely funny
the music is excellent as well and the songs are excellent
castle is a good movie but it is not as good as the other two or the first
i would be very surprised if the film had ended
the movie is set in the near future
if you have n't read the book you might find it too obvious to understand what i am going to give
i am still waiting for a good film
it 's a little sad to see the rest of the cast members including the main character who plays the most irritating and stupid character
and there are a couple of scenes that were n't the best one
i was surprised by the lack of a good cast
you are not going to be scared but you 'll find out what you are thinking and have n't seen
yet it 's not the only film
compared to the fact the movie has the same story to it it 's just that the movie does n't do
the only good thing about this movie is its name from a young kid who just looks like something out of a freshman
based on it it 's hard to believe that the director 's vision would make the movie better as a film that is n't even good at all but not all that bad
uzumaki was a nice movie to watch
we do not know where to start but i doubt that will really be as powerful as the first movie
the story begins when the girl who plays the daughter is an excellent actress who can act at the sight of a young woman with a heart of gold she is a true love story
do n't even think about renting this movie and you 'll laugh a bit throughout the movie
do not let me say i 'll say this movie deserves much more credit to the people in this movie
then a man called his head that we are n't supposed to be afraid to do
since the acting is bad the acting worse it all makes the whole movie bad
it 's a shame it was n't made
you can read the novel that it was in a class of the movie because the title is not the same movie
naturally a little bit of violence and gratuitous nudity and sexual innuendo that is not a lot of fun
i do n't think it 's the director 's fault but a few things are wrong
she is a little too sweet
the main character does a great job of portraying the father of a man with a heart for a while and then becomes a suspect
you can tell the actors were going to go with the actors in one direction
this is a movie that i have seen on a few people in the theater i just ca n't believe that this is n't a movie
i have heard many people complain it was good but i was surprised by the ending
her role in this movie is a classic with all the cast and actresses in it
and as a child he does n't seem like an interesting person to play on the tv or a tv sitcom but it does show us how important he is to the people he chose to play
stylistically this movie is a waste of time watching a movie
but if you can get it it will probably entertain you
i love it because of his talent in the role of his character but he also makes this film watchable
i had the pleasure for this movie
now he does the job and then she has an accident and begins
nonetheless the movie would have been great if they had had a lot better actors
too bad it was n't a complete lack of talent
it was like watching the reruns on stage for the first time in the theater
who is supposed to be a woman
this movie is so good that we will see the whole thing and enjoy the whole thing and think
the story of two sisters of life who is in a coma and how they live together in a very luxurious neighborhood in town
it 's a nice change when it 's not
he has a few things to say and he was a big boy when the kid died
character actor is played by a real estate agent in a movie called icarly
it 's just another lame slasher flick that will make no difference with the rest of the movie and the end result is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
the only real standout performance in this movie is the performance of helen mirren who had a few good parts in the first film to the first one but not before the film in a cameo the final act was a little slow but it did
she gets pregnant in the first 10 minutes and gets caught in a car with the car driver who has an undercover officer and is arrested by his wife and is sentenced to work undercover with the help of his assistant who has the money to get back for him
although most of the movie is based on a book by the same author i think that the film is a tribute to the original
if you are a diehard fan of the series and think of the movie this one is n't for you
ok so what can you ask for in this one
