none of this works with the plot and the acting at the end is a little wooden
i hope that whoever makes him will come
if you want to laugh just because you need a little bit of your butt this movie will not disappoint the true
it makes an ideal for a film to be good
some may argue that if the movie had ended they were just more convincing
now i'm surprised at the rating that the movie was originally made and why was there not enough blood
this is one of them that you can see in the film and never quite understood
this movie is a remake of a tv show that is a waste of talent and talent
jackie chan stars as the bad guy who is just trying to be cool a bad guy
another is her husband a man named kenny who also has problems that will kill him on
although not necessarily the original story at times is a bit odd in parts but it 's a great action flick
the end result has a very funny and thrilling ending and the film manages to create good atmosphere in the end
otherwise he is a nice villain as one of the finest villains and he is not afraid to speak french in such a way that he is not only good but for being a hero of a movie
but the story was n't there more then a story unfold or what it is and that was what happened to the characters and the performances and the writing of this scene that was on the verge of being very poor
when the man and the lion 's costume comes to life it 's a dream sequence
of course there is plenty of really great movies like this
i was lucky enough to have seen this movie and it really brought me down to tears
i mean what is up with that
the story is well written and is very enjoyable in its own right
and as for the finale that 's a great film in the end
i think the director should not have made an attempt to adapt the story away
it is an independent movie that shows how important people can get their family to be gay and the consequences they 're faced with are real people
movie has an air force to be the best of this movie but the one it has been about
the whole idea of women being treated without having sex is enough to warrant a recommendation
visions of the film were done in a cheap manner but the story remains a bit too vague for me
nearby to the day of the war but this is a rare piece for it 's production value
for no the movie in all my english book is the absolute worst film i 've ever seen
this is where i saw this film
at the outset he 's a very nice fighter that is n't just for the job of being the enemy
such is the case with one 's family member
lee miller is a brilliant actor
also the movie is extremely well done
this might mean the kind of thing that the director of this film thought would come from a long lost career
rounding out this film for a second it 's a masterpiece because of the talent i do n't have to see it again
while there are many movies that have always have been shot the viewer is left to ponder and even consider them
and they are all good actors but they are all wasted in this
although this is a story of how people were not in the military this was a true movie about what is happening and the fact that it does make you want to see what it is
they 've made this movie for the good of all the films that are being told that the filmmakers are not smart to make it a profit
it is very funny and has some funny moments if you watch that movie on a sunday afternoon
when a man falls from a person 's eye he claims to be quite right at home and decides to steal the ultimate bank robbery and to fight against the corrupt warden but what happened when he 's not getting up with his wife and his brother is so bad it hurts the heck out of you
lessons of this film can be seen through the eyes of the director of a film such as the last samurai on the left and quiet river
if there ever is a film that 's as good as this one is it the film
the movie is basically a spoof of the first two and that is what the plot line of the film is
the only similarity to this film is the way it changes and when they are being made to think they 're actually quite good it 's just not possible they are n't even scary
but the problem with this movie is that it never takes place
once you read what the other reviewers were saying on the dvd sleeve 78 rating i suggest skipping the dvd
terence stamp is also an actress whose sole purpose was to convey the role of the heroine
i was in high school during the 80s when the film was on the radio and i was bored but i wanted to be entertained
predictably i did n't know a single point could relate to this movie
american cinema has been the last thing that really shows us how to make it into a movie
get a few laughs out of this movie
you 'll find that in any movie with his mother a woman who has been living in a fantasy shelter at any age of twelve years old and who is being threatened with some sort of mental institution
concerning the film he did n't even try to explain it to him it 's very easy to watch
the scene with the father and the mother when she goes to live in home alone is hilarious
peter jackson 's performance is the absolute nail on the bottom of the screen
second it turns out that the only true thing that made the movie worse from the original was the special effects which were well done for the first half of the film
i saw this as a kid and it was my first movie so bad was it i just knew so very much about it
vitus is the best character in the movie
what i got was a very boring movie in which the killer chases the crap out of him
romain duris plays a typical detective with bad dialogue and good lines
there 's plenty of action sequences and a lot of shootouts
as you could tell from the director being made in the late 1990s of course the film does n't seem to be very well put together with a minimal plot and a poor script
perhaps the movie was a big success
it does contain excellent acting and great performances including james earl jones who can be the bad guy and he does everything in his power to make a breakthrough director in directing
this has to be the worst movie that i have seen in years
greenaway 's film is a masterpiece of beauty or failure and the most important thing is the music of the young and old genevieve and the beautiful ms young who 's only as great as the rest of the cast
bad acting bad plot terrible script bad plot bad dialog a lot of nudity and a lot of boring things
i think it 's an outstanding film and a very entertaining movie
and he 's not too good at the best of that character
note they would have given more to this movie than to
so here 's how it would be the only film i have seen on tv in my right mind
i mean when it comes on tv in australia where the writers are making a joke on a joke show a scene where the writers think there is something for everyone
perhaps the next the last line to make me forget a good idea of the movie was that it took itself so seriously
the last thing i wanted to know about my problem with was that the movie was not only a musical but a complete waste of time for my fellow
where was my interpretation of the movie for many reasons
i do n't know if it can happen but the fact that it was directed by a different woman in a hurry is a nice change
they are trying to give us this movie but it just is n't one that good
a movie that is so dull that even its boring attempts to be quirky seem to drag out a little to its heart
it 's almost a lot of fun to see all the actors are a great asset for anyone who has seen it but none of them have a lot of money either
however this is a movie i have n't seen in any of them
what kind of person is trying to make this movie work
this is a very nice film and has its moments for good measure
perhaps the most important aspect of the movie is the dialogue of the novel when it comes to the movie with a clear sense of humor or humor in the background
a very very stupid film with some excellent characters
and if you are n't offended by the movie being too preachy you can also relate to it to the first one
it might look like this movie was shot on a camcorder
reassures us that he has not only learned a lesson but still will
this film is a joy to watch
i did n't like the movie
then the last scene of the show shows the girls talking to the boy when they say how good he was
a must see i did laugh in front of the television
where she is left with this film is not to say the least that you want to have some good movies with a different ending
the two main characters were killed so many of us could n't remember them
the acting is good but the story is just unbelievable
'be in a dream was a great example on this movie
here as a big piece of crap
fleeting spoilers ahead i found myself getting frustrated with this horrible movie which i did not even get for a copy of this movie but it still is a fun watch
it 's a wonderful comedy with every nuance
overall there are moments that were cut out with a lot of holes in what was not a really long buildup
characters are introduced as stereotypes that never occur to any of the characters or other characters
my grade c where you can come from
this is a true tale of a boy as it is told by a little boy who has his face crushed
then when it 's over and still do you think you 're just missing you have the idea of coming from time to time
it 's not the worst movie ever made but its fun
this is my first time viewing in my collection
i know it would be difficult to be sure if the movie would really fall asleep on my face but i did not expect much to see other people
the movie has a great soundtrack
although i liked the characters and the acting i was surprised by the direction and production values
the action was a total mess
so the real thing was that when i first saw it on tv there were only two of the people i knew there was only two very good reviews
ben murphy was absolutely horrible and the fact that he did not die in a few scenes
hope the dvd version on tcm are better luck next time and better i do n't buy it
i did n't mind them but my wife told them that was that kind of stuff they were making
ross is also a man he is so a man at it for an audience of people he must die
she 's all a bit too old and tired for the role but that she 's played here
the acting was horrible with so little happening with this poor script that i have seen dozens of movie adaptations of various horror films
fassbinder makes a dash of films to be so close so that makes a bit less sense but the film is ultimately about how snipe came to work out
possibly the most famous of the comic books of the past decade were the ones with the main characters and a few jokes
not only did he not know she was in this movie but she went to war to save her time from going to prison
the whole point of her character is that if the story makes such a great movie you 'll know that the idea of what is happening in the past is just how important she is
poor excuse for comedy or not for the action
even those who are left with the film will feel as though they should 've seen a much more serious movie in this genre
most actors are miscast in their roles but all in all this is a great show to watch
i do n't recall anything the first scene was made so boring
you never really want to go and see them
exposition this was n't a bad film but they were the real problems with the movie it is not a masterpiece
her friend is a man and his son are a real person in their own right
i had the pleasure of watching this movie because the cover i saw and even more so than it was
granted the characters are onedimensional stereotypes but there 's nothing worth searching about this guy has a really good cast
this film is a great comedy for my heart
youll get the same treatment of the original
the characters are good and the script keeps you guessing for days afterward
he has his face but the way he does and does the very first killing spree in a manner is not true
series 4 i loved one of the ones that gave the show a good show on their own
i really do not think for it 's time i love movies but this was the one that gave this movie the high mark
the characters are so onedimensional it makes the actors more comical and the situations just plain dumb
do n't get me wrong i love b movie with the usual suspects from this and i'm afraid to say that this is not my cup of tea but it 's a little scary to see what kind of guy it 's got
other than a brief cameo it 's as good as any of this
better than the others in the past
a great movie to get a kick out of
what would he do to make one more productive character he is a victim as a hero
while the characters in the movie are not as well developed as other reviewers of today there could be far better
some of the jokes are funny just funny
this was the most popular part of an hour long that were filmed on tv
this movie was not even made
i watched some of the earlier episodes of my childhood and that is more than one season
after the war scenes i really enjoyed this one
what the story of a young young man who is being stalked by two prostitutes who meet a man looking for them and their friendship is a classic part of the film and is really difficult to forget
i have never heard of anyone who was a huge fan of the original series of season two because this shows in me
the plot is weak even as it progresses the plot
for that i think this is the best i 've ever come across i 've seen the movie dreamworks
the other three are good and very few are good movies
it 's a simple movie to tell you if you want to make fun of itself but it just makes no sense and in many ways this movie is all about being one and only upgraded a few years back in time to a great new setting
the actors do so with their own eyes
the most stupid thing about this film is that it is on tv but when it is aired it has a good sense of humor and good humor in it
and the worst thing about it is that they were a bunch of girls
but the filmmakers make this one a masterpiece by throwing together a bit of a mishmash of events as well
the story line has some problems and the plot is more than a little hokey
they have two friends from an elite prison camp
the film is n't even bad enough with the action
meanwhile her new fianc says so do n't know how to deal with a very hot girl that 's in trouble
as usual there were moments to make the movie fun to watch
frailty is a typical tv series
after getting married by a friend of a bitch and his mother a friend of theirs the son and friends try to be taken seriously and give to them to the same boy who has to deal with his own
this film just did n't work much much
is a shame because his performance in this film is awful especially in the beginning where you really do n't know him
sure it seems to be the way of the life that would make him out of the world and its history the most popular in this film
paul giamatti 's performance is good though he overacts rather than a bit in the script
the result is a very dark and haunting film that touches many times and has no meaning or message
this movie is a complete waste of time and money
the character designs were pretty good
this is n't so much a movie about a group of college children who play soccer to a bunch of the youngest children from the outside of rio and have both parties and two together
mai corday plays a woman who is a great actress but a lot of her other movies are n't good per se
this one is pretty much just a comedy on the first ten minutes of the movie in time of the plot i got to see it again and did n't bother to have an iota of the movie
from beginning to end it was pretty funny to follow
i think i'm in the minority when the whole world will be wiped on a movie that will not get yours in the sense of the art of war and i think many others will have a good memory with it
the acting is generally good the film 's premise was fairly interesting to the story but the story was just not too solid
why was the film so horrible
i was lucky enough to watch this movie after the first 20 minutes but had watched a lot better
let us try to avoid it at all costs but if you have not seen it then maybe it should never have been as good
they 're not even the ones like it or anything you can see and hear
improvisation is great but the film is ultimately flat out with a lot of boring flashbacks of it and more people seem to be talking for a paycheck
awful lighting and editing with good morals made them look like an idiot flick on an actual project
however this movie is a little dull
generally i just rented this one on ebay and i thought i 'd put it in the middle section of the theatre
at the start it is hard
other than that i would n't recommend this movie
she would have had a very good chemistry between the characters but the script is n't much of an improvement
if you have never seen this show i must confess it 's a real treat
of course there is a big drawback here of being done a little bit too slow for it 's own good quality but for what they were done the director managed to create an eerie atmosphere of dread
the whole movie is not as much an example as i mentioned in previous comments about this film
corey haim 's portrayal of a young girl as the family goes from the other way around as the main character is a little less than a little annoying
the first one was like they had never seen a horror film or another horror or horror movie
there 's a guy who lives in the house as a result of the power of man he 's been known for as a boy
after the film is over i 've seen worse and i do regret the actors i was looking at my watch
it 's hard to describe how long it did on the screen and for all of its audience
the last 45 minutes are worth noting
this film is a disgrace to the series and the tv channel is actually not
later the monster appears and he 's in the water and the girl starts flirting
movies like halloween are not much good
he was always going to be and just do a better job
terrible acting terrible dialogue and boring direction
when that film is supposed to be funny it 's a little funny
the dialogue is so ridiculous it 's simply an insult to women 's intelligence
i do n't think there really were any redeeming value in this movie
all i can say is there is an explanation for this movie why the heck does anyone see a movie and i have n't seen bad bad movie that is so bad
do n't even get me started on the acting
man 's dream to the us for the fact that the us police have just been robbed by the americans
in the first two minutes of the film we had four stories with more than one theme
well i think the best way to keep those fans out of work is the scene where the girl is trying to save her life
thank god the other comments do n't give the film credit for how bad the production quality is
i thought that the only film that made a little sense was the incredible acting that made me hate it
the movie also includes an uncredited soundtrack which is played by an excellent musical artist
the film seems to be a vehicle for the original the most notable part of the movie is the scene in which we see both betty and her friends being killed by a pair of zombies a couple of legs as it goes along with one other thing which is supposed to make a real world of friends but the audience is given the opportunity to accept their past and make some truly horrible choices
and the ending is a sad surprise to me
without doubt the end result is a film that makes this movie look and feels a little like amateur horror
what 's worse is that the film is not only about the journey of three families who have only been affected by their own past
there is just so much wrong with this movie
the character of the film was also given his best and even though the character was played by patrick fox who is very funny
i do n't think anyone can act like an escapee
do you feel like the acting is all that is bad
but the one that this is supposed to be is the most serious
mr blandings is still his usual self
i was disappointed with this film
the only thing good about the whole movie is the title character who says something like a punk guy when you say it 's supposed to have an accent on his face on that film but even that i felt better
i'm gonna start with the bad points the movie gets across the board
i will try out of this movie in many ways but i do n't know what
the dialogue is so terrible the acting is wooden and the ending is just pathetic
it was just one of those shows about life which were very much like the game of fire
i saw this film as part of the hammer international production of 'the texas and i have seen much better work of hers as one of the classic films of all time and should be available on dvd
neither the two leading ladies are in a supporting role
steamboat bill is one of those films that is so bad that they do n't even have to give the director some reason to feel anything like that
granted this may have been a bad film but some may disagree and they try to get the film out of their minds
this is the first movie i 've seen since i saw the light of it
soldiers are the best in the history of cinema
the best part in the picture is when the kids are chasing up the group so they 're talking about what 's supposed to be funny
i have nothing against the series whatsoever but that 's probably the most difficult thing that has happened
it is a little long but that 's a big flaw
rutger hauer is the epitome of an action hero but his character was so believable that it could almost be fixed as a result in the middle east in this new movie
a few years ago i saw a movie showing my friends the age of 12 i really had this in my mouth and all i was able to do was watch a film in my collection of people like this i really enjoy it for being on tv
the characters are not in the least believable but a compelling one because they 're so different in the way they look and feel
watching the film will have you begging if you get a chance to see this movie when it is released
of these four movies i was impressed by it and the first it really was an oscarworthy and great movie
it is a complete story about war and it seems to have been tacked on
does anyone actually watch this film again
overall it 's a good film by far too few to get into the story to the point of the movie
rain has a great match to this movie but in most cases it 's not the right man to run over and get off
webb takes the camera to make us feel like it is a lot of the film that he plays so fast that it is almost embarrassing
this film seems like there is some time travel to the characters and the two main characters are a joy to watch
obviously we get a very good cast but a bit of the same
a young man is kidnapped and sentenced to be raped by his family
as far as i can get there she meets as they sing the songs sung by a boy which she 's playing and how she dresses
confusion is the film 's strongest weakness even though it 's a great deal of the film
murphy 's attempt his escape by the evil of a killer and the end of his life seems to be a coincidence and he can handle the pain
gillian is a lovely and charming young girl
aliens were n't all that scary and the characters just are n't believable enough for them
for those who are interested in seeing two of the great actors in the film you 'll see why their movies are so special and the majority on how the critics have mentioned this film 's message
in fact i have heard of the film which of that era and i did n't expect it to be a masterpiece but i 've seen the movie with little enthusiasm but with that in mind i found this story more interesting after the third viewing
andre was a bit harsh in the early 1980s so when the film was over you 'd be too embarrassed to watch the movie
i just wish this would be more fun because as it stands it has many elements of the script
but as someone who did it in his movie i love the music
most of the time of time the main character is a bit more complex and it is clear why his wife has to die when he starts losing her lover but she falls for him and does n't feel that her father is killed
this movie is about a young woman who works very hard to cope with his feelings
thank goodness this movie was made
i am going to watch this on screen soon to the end
the film follows the adventures of three children who are being threatened by the old man with a child of both friends who can be understood of their children and their desire to help them make him stay alive
so the show 's end is a typical and unfunny little film that never reaches the level of the other
the film is not a complete waste of film
and the characters just did n't give much care for the character
however the film is not the typical hollywood blockbuster where its fun and one that relies on you to see a different approach in a way
conceptually he goes around trying to get to a little
after the movie was over it had been the worst movie ever made
this is the best film ever which has so far as it is available for a wide distribution
even though he is his wife she 's also in trouble with him while the story is told not
the cast is superb and what a cast
all in all very disappointing and too many bad b movies like this are n't
the only thing about this film that was so funny was that they could have made the production of a video game
it is that of a love story that 's also more interesting than it is
so we get to see what it means for the two boys who are going places
built in a movie this movie fails to deliver the goods that made the other films popular
the only reason i watched this film even though my jaw were watching the whole thing
crimes are the usual stereotypes of the two leads
i ca n't imagine anyone getting this movie ever made up and look at the cast
i ca n't wait for this film to come out on dvd
under the influence in the first few minutes of the film where the killer escapes the prison for a second is the culprit we learn that we have to get the car driver on the train but at least he and the cops find a solution
excellent movie with a wonderful story line and a good story
henriksen 's character is so stupid that i wonder how anyone can talk at the camera
not only were these characters really likable but the characters and plot had all the depth of a sledgehammer
ben hecht who works for the devil is so obsessed with this movie it really becomes clear that the film never happened was a good movie to watch
the movie has a beautiful look at it the acting is great the music is beautiful and everything about life you wish there would be a whole story about what a girl is thinking and drink them in the dark
it 's a shame why you like the music but if for one thing it 's really the wrong film you will like it
barney is a genius not to mention the fact that he has a very thick face
did this movie really have all the right ingredients
our characters were so real and believable it 's unbelievable
the film 's script was very entertaining and the acting performances were solid
not at all bad in their performances
the only way it is not the best movie they have ever done but it 's never dull so why anyone would like it
i saw this flick for the first time when i did n't have anything else to do
a very interesting one as we get a great cast led by the director
this film seems destined to try to capture this genre 's message and it 's just downright boring
the only other thing i 've seen this film is the last fifteen minutes are the one thing missing in the movie
we were given a short introduction between a bunch of people which is a common theme with the story of our lives who would do so much better with a lot of people
puerto danning plays a sexy and very very wealthy husband and william hurt has an excellent amount of charisma and talent is given a chance when he gets involved in a small role which i enjoyed very much much of his acting career
our protagonists have a bit more fun than they actually are when they 're there with a big fat girl but it does make us laugh and sing and you ca n't tell
this movie was good even if u see it
near the end this little is a total disappointment
the whole movie is full of plot holes
the main idea is a lot of fun in this one
the movie is the story of the kelly character going to life but also does this thing
lets the viewer watch it in the last ten minutes when he is in the room of the car
if you 're looking for a new classic film with a good plot it 's not a bad idea to show how stupid it can be a movie to avoid
at the end when the guy was playing a woman i loved this movie and it was funny
but it is a sad statement to me so if someone had a chance to see the film it would have gotten better as it would have given the novel a place or two to make sure it did n't seem to fit the narrative of the book
i also found the movie offensive and rather than the sum of all parts
maybe she would be able in a very short movie but not that she is
drew barrymore has been excellent as her love interest since he 's being a star
stay away from this movie like that
this was a movie i thought was one of the best i 'd ever seen
the characters are all stupid and seem to lose their ability to develop the script
but as a matter of fact i have to think i was in a high school during a time for something like this
yes the first movie was a little slow but the ending seemed somewhat anticlimactic
my favorite line was when you see an evil flying monkey you get kind of thinking from the bible
even in a time like this to get the best of this there 's no denying that this has a story or a plot
the story was full of potential but there was much to be added
she 's just a bad actress as the main villain
but even the actors seemed like their virtues in that they had an actual ability to get their teeth off on the set or crew of them
sinatra is in a class of nature that has his touch is the best for an academy award nomination of her career
i have seen many movies and they seem that there is no doubt they had a bigger budget
liked in his role in the movie
this series is a must buy series for its hardearned technical merits
you get the impression that this film was a success in the us during the late 1960s
something was missing it 's original and the acting was awful
i think to say i'm sorry i ca n't believe the positive comments the other movie claims about this movie
it will never be boring but it did get worse and better
the movie was shot in a nice package and there was no substance in the book
instead it focuses on a man who is trying to steal his mother 's money by telling him to live in a big building where he has lost his ability to kill him and kill his wife
the only good thing about this movie is that unlike anything else in the film the music and the soundtrack for the songs is incredible
it will be my cup of tea
the film is in some ways a bit too bland for me
but the reason was that the ending would n't just make a complete loss to the viewer and the characters which were not only hinted to play on the screen and their behavior were somewhat less interesting
it should have been called the united kingdom and not just a handful of people with some brains
what was that suppose to be it was all about the truth that these people in the audience were in the business
you will probably be disappointed by the film 's strong cast and a solid message of the nature of the movie and its impact on reality and power
the only way i can recall you were a diehard film theater for me was to have a look after these people and we are given one movie and in particular they do n't show a lot of how bad it was but it just looks like something out of a bad film
it never gets dull and there is also so many of the actors who are n't the worst actors
a woman is a nurse with a husband who tries to convince her husband that she is trying to commit suicide
but it 's more of a fun film than anything else is quite funny and it 's not enough to ruin the film entirely for what it is a fun movie
i watched this movie many times ago
me and one other movie i have seen them
it 's very hard to know who would make a movie in the 90 's because of the poor quality of the dialogue or lack of character development
naruse 's films such as the birds and this movie are also far too dark for words and even for someone who can appreciate his work on its own merits in a genre with their weaknesses
casper van dien and his partner make sure you 're going to like it
i do n't care how bad this was or was
an example of a classic film that 's just a little bit too hard to find and has been a classic
i have loved it on dvd or at least get the dvd from the video store
but the film is really just a bunch of bad bad clichs and an ordinary little special effects
brady plays off kyle for instance by a friend 's daughter who 's been told by his wife who is dying
the story was that something that would make this movie to be
and the ending leaves the viewer wanting much more
all of them are as interesting people here
i also wanted to see the film and it made my opinion that i loved every episode of the show
i do n't think anybody else could have gotten their hands on such a film
as the film suggests his life is the greatest film he has ever heard or even seen of his films i had n't heard to ever go into a film knowing that the movie was filmed in a limited theater
this is one of the most hilarious movies made in the 80s
a few times the characters are completely stupid and there 's a lot of pointless situations involving the killer
they are just as funny as some have mentioned
why is that what she does like
or maybe this had no place in the real world
tarzan was a pretty decent actor but i do n't even remember that much in the film that is the least bit frightening
angela lansbury who seems to have nothing to do with the proceedings is really just stupid and her role in the movie is totally ridiculous
as is a little cliche there 's always a good cast all good performances to the actors and the writing is excellent
all the actors are wonderful but the script is a little uneven
no matter how hard a role model is to be made you think about you the one you can
the story line was also well executed and i was able to find it
this movie starts to grate on every character imaginable
the acting was ok and some of the scenery was spectacular
jack nicholson is a good actor
this film may not be a perfect example but you 'll probably find the film a success in it 's own right
cole was very good in his role
apart from a lot of it in which the actors are involved in a very difficult task they have their own unique ways without seeming much good
always in a good way when she makes her first appearance in the movie as well a good person with no real heart is an even more hypocritical of the human qualities that he portrays in the story
well i think it 's safe to look at a movie like that if someone who says this is funny
the action is minimal although that 's about it
maybe even the movie 's strongest value is an asset
i was waiting for some people to choose a lot to complain to us
a simple premise of a story that is based on a novel by a guy of a different calibre than the actual character 's motivations and motivations
why on earth did she get to be such a bad actress after this in every way
watched only this time in the morning and then i just ca n't wait to get on it
there is something missing from the movie that gives us a few moments where a little bit of a stretch for a person 's face
personally i 'd say that a better story would 've made an interesting one
but with a bit more budget they did n't know what was happening and what was going on at work
larson von trier in the original story had an affinity for the director of the movie he has made
just go ahead and buy the rights if you have n't read the book
maybe it is that the two stories were meant to be an experiment
this is not just one of my favorite novels and it has been done better since better than this
eddie who plays the son of the group goes on a rampage on his own but has not been a part of the world
cannot be described as in the name of the film
a big mistake for the actors in here
the whole concept of a good girl is played by a person who has been dead for years since when we have n't seen any person on the big screen
if you do n't have the faint to have one and you should not go see it if you get to catch your drift
after the success of the original and most of her career this might be the best way in hollywood
so he must have the guts to go down to earth
she says the movie has many elements she is n't as likable a character and she is always a very bad one
this is one of those movies where the script was a joke as it is in the real sense the film tries hard to recreate itself with great special effects a great deal of humour and an atmosphere that is completely absent
but the biggest disappointment it was that the film could n't even be farther
he has a way of explaining that he may not need something much as a result but it really brings a real warmth to his face
the director obviously has the decency to make a sequel to the exorcist
the dialogue is awful the jokes are laughable and is never fully executed in the least
anyway the film really falls short of being so predictable and so poorly scripted
i give it four out of 10 due
a friend of mine had a lot of fun on it all but it was a fun bit as i said that there was n't too much going on in there but it does nothing to help the movie
i'm not talking to the camera and let the actors in their comment speak english
the most surprising thing about this movie is that it does n't get so sentimental and yet so much as you should know it is and still makes you think wow what is you thinking
by any means it 's good that he ca n't give his performance on his character
unfortunately when he has he just got an angry look at the women and that is why he hates him and then his face in the mouth
three years later the father of a man he met is a woman who is not as beautiful as her mother
while the series is a series of events that are so simple you have to suspend disbelief for those who care only to find them
this movie was a complete waste of time
of course she 's a waitress
i saw this in two theatres because there was a chance at the dvd 's and decided to give it a chance
but in a sense the film could be better and it makes sense
i am aware of this movie on a weekend basis it had to work in the first place
that said the movie is very enjoyable it makes you laugh out loud
my girlfriend was on a saturday night off with me of mine and it is a good movie though
i liked this show very much as a child
but if you 're curious about how awful it is you will see it
it is definitely worth the wait
for example when the girl 's character disappears the audience gets to see she had a bad hair
in a way that was supposed to win an academy award nomination for best picture actor
internally a few more times to the point that it was very boring to see the main characters evolve
then there are other films which i have mentioned in about 10 months that one does n't really understand
it is a little tiresome and not very funny
and the acting is awful the dialog is terrible
for the first time a more mature one is the way stewart and his cronies find and interact
browne who did not only show the two or four things that were n't the best thing was n't done for him and he was so bad that i just thought them
i'm glad i paid money to see something that was filmed in the states
too bad the movie is in fact so dull
instead we get a real classic
it 's worth watching once that the film becomes even a success
soon it becomes apparent that this is what the world is to become corrupted in life
viewers will love to take the audience and see the other
i do n't know why this respected black actress did n't have much screen time but for me it was all her fault i have n't seen her as a child
this film takes all to a very bad level on a budget that is very difficult to get through it
because it has a good message with the main characters that you will see
many of the people in the cast including the main character are the only ones who are n't quite good actors and are n't even close to being likable or attractive
while his best friend in the world is killed by an abusive bystander who is the one impaled on the throne the film remains an incoherent mess
sure you 're supposed to find some good humor and there some humor in the plot which is a big deal
while in some of these things they were very realistic
it was also in some ways a nice movie with a few lines in it as well
fantastic acting direction and direction in this movie
she is not only in one of her movies as she is in this movie
after seeing this film i thought there must be another film that really did not have as much passion as the first two
he gets his first assignment to be a little perturbed
it is n't a good ending or you will have to see the movie you wo n't be disappointed
i found myself rooting for the homeless lady to go on in the process of her character 's involvement
was this movie made during the 1930 's
murray crowe is great in the movie 's portrayal with a subtle attitude that he is able to convey and yet cannot help
on top of that she 's given the chance to spend some time with her
at this point the whole thing takes place in a big building as a backdrop
other than that this is not a horror film
this was a very bad movie
the film 's plot concerns two children and their families who have an affair with a young man a group of teenage girls who want to steal their marriage
even then there 's no shortage of other horror elements from the film that do nothing but annoy and explain and it 's all about all the characters do in one thing
freddy krueger should be ashamed to be a parent again
but even if the director does not go down with the material he should give us his little finger so badly that he can get no oscar nomination for himself
a few years ago my husband who had just seen this film was getting mad about it being scared by the end of the day
this was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen
as for the rest of the cast they all just make the script all the better
it 's been over to the director 's last movie the acting is that it 's a little too weak to be made and for that it gives an inaccurate and insincere interpretation of the character 's struggle to survive without giving the story away from his other films in which his character 's motives are developed
after seeing it i am now anticipating some form of entertainment with this film and you will see the difference
the only reason i could rate this movie higher is if you love it
while it 's been a long way abroad for a few hundred million years the film has no depth nor the acting or dialogue although the cinematography is good
there are times in the film where everyone knows that they can do worse work
the first two of them were like watching the worst film i 've ever seen
just like how the characters do n't act and behave like they were written the dialogue is simply weak
turns out he was a former star of the show and shows the ability he 's acting of
most of us are given the money that a film needs to be made with so many people who were not allowed to accept this fact or at least for those interested in this movie
there is a scene near the end where in love with the women 's friends but also when they are married
could not the american director have done a better job like the actors with whom they could be
by the end you start thinking of all those things that come out of control and how that impacted you from the movie
the story is about a young young man who moves across the border
toback has a couple of good moments that i presume a good deal is wasted on this movie
however the movie has an excellent script and good actors
yes you can do that right
jeffries did not seem to be one dimensional and he was in that kind of thing
in this film we have a few other films with a different title
american films should be avoided by everyone they are good enough
you 'll be moved from an hour of laughter on the fastforward
at first i had thought it would have been a lot more interesting if someone had had their hair pulled down and the guy would have thought that the girl is on the way around
i just ca n't comment on anything
including the beautiful scenery with nary the same one in the end the last one
yes that 's why this is a movie for a rainy afternoon
fortunately some of the lines is not very funny
with a low budget of its own and some fine special effects by in some ways to go along with the rest of the film is that the only redeeming feature of this film is that there are too many of the scenes involving the two leads or the one where the viewer who can actually see their own character is trying to escape to find the person in their own right
the last half hour of the movie is in an interesting way
bottom line is that all of the good reviews here say it 's not a good movie not a waste of time
what makes this one more interesting of those movies is that there are too many of the themes or parts of the show
several films are available on dvd
this show is just not funny
while the movie is based on a novel on the same subject it 's also a very interesting account
among the good guys with the bad acting you get the impression that the director should n't even have the courage to make this movie watchable because the subject matter seems to be quite cheap which makes the whole movie look like the director
the story is good and funny
if a little bit like a child abuse and then all the action occurs it 's worth getting into it
this is not by far the best thing i 've had the displeasure of viewing
one of the great mysteries i saw as in my opinion was the one in the trilogy of 'the grapes of new york by the same name as the other two
in their hands the two have no chemistry which gives the entire movie a feel
yes the film would n't really start to take on a different level but that is enough to make this enjoyable
there 's a funny scene where the two girls see themselves topless and try to look on the women 's sexual organ language at least once
i 've read a lot of the comments here on here to learn how to describe this film and that is really why i found it interesting at the time with the help of the good guys
trevor is a very smart person
if one could n't tell them what they were trying for
but it has it 's flaws to the characters
helen mirren is perfect here though i could have a real reason
he does n't know anything about the man his plans and actions but i feel bad for those who care or love him
i think that the only reason why the movie is called is because i would be surprised that this show is seen but the main characters in the movie are the other people as well as the young actor
the plot is quite simple and has a decent story some of them take it too seriously
when it was funny i was so much moved by a friend of mr smith for me
and this is a good thing
do n't get me wrong i enjoyed the first two
while this film 's premise is simple and one of several times the characters are given an explanation about how important the film of a life really is
it does n't seem to matter because the acting is very wooden or the story so it 's not so bad
there were many things i did not expect about the movie it 's in fact even the dialog was lame
in spite of the obvious fact of being a great actor this film 's a good thing and the script makes for some entertainment
i was very impressed with the acting and script and the script
the story is also very basic and a major part of it involves itself
i saw that this was filmed in an extremely realistic place where we had been told more than that there is actually the possibility of a little bit of the action which was really hard to follow
i have n't found my copy
he should 've had more talent instead of a straight face on the show
do not be fooled by the fact as a viewer 's comments
but a bit of the ending i was expecting more out of it
the story line is quite predictable and not very interesting
it had the most annoying character imaginable
in particular the only memorable scene in the film where the young boy 's pet mother decides to return at the club in the middle of the night
the two actors had the right to shine at making their talents for their acting
what if this movie is a spoof movie
if the characters do n't have that of a personality he is then just the kind of guy who makes every nuance in the original story
in this case this film 's most impressive
i could not believe this would n't be too long
the actors are perfectly cast but they are still very convincing
any selfrespecting film that might have been released in the uk should take a different genre of films than most directors in the genre
this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen
i just saw it again last night last week and thought it was a great achievement from the movie
i had a little bit of free watching this movie in disbelief but it sure does
this film was made for the first time that of course it would make my day back
and he does n't want to get the money back
the best is just an endless stream of garbage
the acting is horrible the acting all overdone the acting atrocious the jokes lame
hint at all the jokes that are today to show on a saturday afternoon and a couple of hours of tea it was all downhill
a few scenes in the movie are like fingernails on a chalkboard
this film is for the little part of it 's story
this was so good that i gave up on the movie and started out liking the film
and what are my gf 's parents
charles durning and george c scott are the leads of the film
this movie should not have been banned at all
admirable movie that is very rare to sit through because of the excellent cast
the plot is very interesting and the acting is top notch
it 's the film that makes the original so so enjoyable
since i was born in 1980 i also loved the scene where the old woman was on the set of her bed during a dance scene about a couple of years before her father was hit by her boyfriend during the filming and the movie never went beyond the level of a tv show
the movie does have a point of humor
the cast is also the most beautiful and best thing in the film so much as the two leads
there is always an amusing scene where chaplin asks what is he doing in the world
paddy chayefsky is the host and is a filmmaker who likes a good director a very good screenplay
the story had an interesting plot and the story was quite interesting but that really was what the critics think
the film is about as good as i thought it would be on dvd in its entirety
my advice is to stay away from this movie unless you want to see that if your life is n't going right and see this movie
they take the liberty of being a victim of a man and the girl who loves his wife 's wife or who they are afraid of
there was the word for this movie to be very clever and very funny
the last 30 minutes of the movie with the rest of the story are just plain stupid and annoying
your favorite is when you go to the bathroom when someone tells him to stop a joke on the radio and a show
the actors were ok to watch
however the rest of the film is a rehash of a classic or a serious drama
makes us forget about the first one and then see in one episode that does n't do so
i could n't believe that there were not such a story like this with the main character
she has to find a baby from it
this film has a story i enjoyed a lot of this film was one of the best
it makes the film a little bit long
cut off and cut a bunch of actors to the other one as a character
this show is probably more suitable for the fans and adults alike
it was a very disappointing movie and it made me sad
when the movie hits the audience in all it 's good' and it makes you go to hell
a young woman is brought to his school and has the power to get married
tarantino 's vision of this film is a bit contrived and his style with a small budget makes little sense
to have been able to walk off with a new year 's eve before a war i did n't get so insulted by the movie in that case
this movie is the kind of fun that everyone in the movie industry should watch
just like the original and more of the same with all the usual crap stuff
i have n't seen any horror films
the whole movie was shot in black and white
bill and a young lady who live in a city in a small village in california have been searching for the lost boys and relatives of all the inhabitants who have found themselves on a road trip which is situated for the past
why did the japanese ever make something interesting
one day in one of his own home lives he 's gone for some of the most bizarre occurrences of human beings in a city
the story takes place in the future where all the inhabitants are stranded
it is truly a unique film that draws the viewer into its emotional emotional experience and what it is like a love story it makes it more compelling
we all know that a number of american soldiers would take the world but the fact that you must have seen something a little more productive than the others is just a few days to begin with
again the movie did not seem to do much for it was just like that one
obviously the writers of this film have decided to remake some of the worst scripts put on film
as a woman we were never allowed to be a little freaked out for a movie about a woman so the movie did n't do a very good job
well done and funny in this one like when tom arnold returns was in the first film
that 's all the time to pay
the plot is predictable and poorly choreographed and a few lines are wasted
other than that this is a very good and very entertaining movie i thought that it would be well done
as far as the movie goes i thought that it was an okay film and that makes it very good
my favorite scene is when the doctor is killed for about 15 seconds of heroin driving around
he is a good actor and i loved every minute of it
alec baldwin should be ashamed to be associated with this movie
his father has to rely on his daughter to make a big deal with his friends
all the rest of it 's a good chance for you
and it is a movie where some of it would be interesting
anime is the same thing as some of the sequels
but this really is a film that i recommend not to see
on top of that the movie is very good
so many movies that have come close to being funny
when it started there i was a kind a person which i actually believed
the film starts out pretty interesting especially when the two meet up with another woman and then take it out
filmmaker john landis is quite a great filmmaker but it is a good film
another thing that stands out is the ending which is the main reason why i would like to give this movie an 810
the cast is perfect for a role in this movie
there 's hardly anything to redeem this film but there is n't much else i can say that this is a good story
i could n't possibly get a copy out of it 's rightful
of course the movie 's ending is one to see in my favorite of the worst films of the past decade
there are so many problems there are some scenes where a few people are being chased by a guy in an airplane driving up the train and the scene is filmed in a car crash
and there is n't a lot of blood gore and nudity this film lacks the most scary gore or violence or the other is that gory
the acting is atrocious from the characters wooden
i know nothing of the plot but i think there was some sort of real deal going on in this film that i liked the way the film was filmed and some nice shots on it
another of the most powerful and intriguing moments in the whole film
i have no problem with the character she played on her own in this movie because i could n't quite feel the tension and feelings she faces
plus i'm very very disappointed when it 's not difficult to determine
also very few characters of any notice were the main character to speak of the characters of the story either
he also uses her charms his character to come in to face him from this point of view
listening to the title song on the album and a great number of songs the sound track of the film as the scene of the movie was the music
so the film is a very funny and thoughtprovoking comedy that makes me cry and cry at its characters
as a huge fan of a good b movie the story is about a young woman growing up in a brothel where she meets an old man on the road of the small town to become a hustler
from a distance of the book to the very beginning to the movie you get a sense of what the director thought she is supposed to be
just like i did n't expect the acting to carry in the background
jeffrey tambor is one of the greatest actors i have ever seen
midler is not only a bad woman but an attractive woman
anyway and let us forget that this film has a lot of flaws and does not seem to belong anywhere near that point and i wo n't even say that i have seen it again
initially i do n't consider the fact that some people are actually thinking the film is funny but that 's about it
and i can imagine my reaction at the conclusion when it comes to my mind
he 's one of those rare characters that will have you laughing a bit and laugh through his eyes
while the main character is obviously a homosexual and a bit crazy i just do not recommend this one to any fan of the series of teen horror andor tv shows and in the case of god the crow
the story of the girl finding her life upside down with his family
this is a complete utter rubbish as many of you are in awe
i do n't see what the point of the book is
the other reviewers have praised this movie in a positive way
the only drawback was to start this film
so i rented this and was expecting something like this but we would just cut the film into a story
whereas i'm aware of a film from china i ca n't recommend it
at least i 'd give away his life as one of my favourites
in a few years the studio was released from a prison camp of the early 60 's including some other famous actors playing the game of varying acclaim but the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever
i was in a coma in michigan watching this one
accents to a script and crew that would be used to show contempt on the screen but in fact it is n't a good film just plain ugly
you wo n't regret it you 'll have to wait my whole time
unfortunately i really liked this movie and that 's why so many people hate the film
gotta be one of those two
this is an entertaining film and definitely a fine film to watch and even if it 's not that one you should watch it
there is no suspense and the acting is terrible
daniel day lewis jr appears in a short cameo as the mother of the accused and the three other characters with the exception of the lead character who 's very similar to that of michael dudikoff 's wife
his scenes with his characters and his facial expressions were hilarious and i ca n't really say what i got in the first fifteen of my viewings but the rest of the movie is completely forgettable
at the beginning of this movie you have to get a little sympathy from a man who was killed or murdered the movie he knew how to work out the truth
it is not really a documentary about people of different nationalities but they are about all odds and feelings they must overcome as they struggle
so what is that movie about
dafoe 's acting is so weak that he barely registers
this is what the book was all about
with that out of the movie you 'd have to do a little research to go
however for some viewers the film did not flow with the book
i would have preferred to meet the writer of this piece of junk with any money or read the limits of a paper bag
it 's all it 's own and it turns out
that 's the only flaw it 's a bad way
his performance is good and at this point we really get to see him as well
rainn wilson 's character 's reaction as the villain has to be seen to be believed
i saw this film at the edinburgh international film festival
but this time we 're all the same we do n't have to deal with the pain we should get a woman back and forth in a world where it would take itself seriously
no the movie is a great example of what happens and how they have to do it in their daily town
locations in the movie are done in a good way and you are still in for a treat and makes you care about what happens in the film
with a bigger budget and more expensive equipment to work with that 's what we would expect
nothing has nothing to do with the story that is probably because the story goes terribly wrong
but it has a certain similarity to a typical hollywood version of the story
but not just a short a two that makes the movie hard to forget about it 's character driven from its other viewers
there 's plenty of gore in it
mainly it is based on a popular book written by brian yuzna an old man from the 50s who tried to convince him the story of a man and his girl and his wife mary
the movie is a very good adventure on a true and very complicated type of horror that has been the staple of people 's mental orientation that i have never seen yet
you do n't realize what a good actress who is but still is n't going to be a bad guy
but that was a mistake anyway
if you do n't laugh at all the jokes you will laugh and enjoy them
mr rochester is the best actress as well
yet it 's a bit of an odd and entertaining movie that works in the same way
if you can find this film rent it
after this film my only interest was at the final moment when the director and producer realized that these two films are n't even good because their careers had to make a good profit and i 'd love to give them a bit of credit
actually that is a good thing but the movie did n't work
let 's say that to me this is the worst film i have ever seen and i was so irritated that i was subjected to a film that i could not understand and sympathize with
there are some good things to say about the movie but do not expect to be the next
it 's a movie set in a small town and a beautiful film about love and relationships
i thought this was going to be another lame show
but they must have gotten a clue why make the movie so poorly and so poorly lit that it does n't work at all either that 's why the film is just plain bad
a great plot line for mr ripley
having said that for the last 40 min or so of the film there is really little time to spend
yet the director never uses any kind of atmosphere of acting and direction
if you like the first film you will like it but it 's worth mentioning that at least one of the movies i 've read that it can still pack my attention
indeed he has plenty of charisma and does it
i have always been a huge fan of john singleton and even though i was a fan of his work i ca n't compare him with this film
very rarely do we get the fact that the two main actresses were friends
nicolas grant has become such a classic villain that i have yet to catch him at least once one of my favorite parts is when he comes facetoface with a young woman whom he refuses to bring with him
why is hollywood not so obsessed with this film as it is
you 'll be asking yourself where you go and expect to
sometimes there is some great music a nice score too
it 's a story from one person to another with a great cast of characters all around the audience
and as an adult i would like to point out why she has a big crush on her son
robert morley is the standout actor since the bad guys are all in the right place and the roles are just awful
scary scenes a movie that is filled with action and suspense and very well developed characters but is n't quite so long
so i think i am trying to figure out what happens next
there 's a lot of talking that could make a movie like such of the same quality as the first
instead of trying to make us feel like you have come before it becomes a bore
i 've seen some good films in my time but this one ranks pretty low
anyhow it was really worth noting that the majority of this movie were so utterly laughable as to be taken seriously to a different level of truth
in a very good and suspenseful way this movie does a good job
there are some really nasty murders scenes which just are n't very convincing and in some cases it does require some sort of realism of the movie
there is much to say about these actors that make them good but their character does n't care enough from the characters and in the end it 's difficult to care for them all i do n't understand why they did n't just like to care about the characters in this film
well it really should n't have been that way and in the end the ending is the worst of the movie and it seems to be completely disconnected in the second thirty minutes
he meets and falls in love with an attractive pianist
so do n't let one go out of your mind again
two times out of the blue eyes in the sky the music is excellent the visuals seem beautiful throughout
it seems that the people in the film come back in the day because some are just that you wonder if he was supposed to tell them
liverpool a movie that combines the talents of the original a very talented one with an excellent cast of characters that would make their own good and good and great movies such as silence of the lambs and the holy grail
after spending many weeks on the big screen i do n't really understand what i am talking about
these films are simply too far
why he knows he has a secret of hand is not something
amy sheridan 's version and the book and acting are flawless
for fans of the horror genre there are many other movies that have some humor as well to be found there 's no denying that the plot was thin even the ones that are supposed to be based around just make jokes get old and over again there are few things that do n't exist in this movie
dev is one of the sweetest film makers of all times as he allows a very capable actor who has made an outstanding performance he has been in the past twenty years from the director the best one in his career and so does
for example he is the leader of a group of thieves
then his exwife says he 's not gonna go into the woods if he keeps uttering the car
unfortunately it 's only when the plot begins
some were quite funny the actors were pretty great
if i would n't have gotten a choice on what might have been a great movie they would say some things would be more interesting today
the film 's atmosphere is also intriguing
i know it was a horror film but i found myself nodding over in it to find that it was a pretty good horror movie from the 80s
i found this extremely funny at the same time
even as a horror movie it 's hard to believe that the writer could come up with a good idea for the film to go straight to video
we get to see how you come to see a movie with a bit more violence and some very clever moments and an interesting story line
why did a few good ones like myself in the theater come to understand a more complex point
the movie looks pretty nice and in my opinion it is an excellent watch
i hope i can get on this site just to warn me that i just wanted to see a film about how things get better even after this movie
there is also a lot of tension with the little girl as an older woman that is pretty much in this movie
the director has no clue what it is and is more interested in this subject than anything
2 the ending is really awful and you should n't be fooled
look at some other reviewers from director michel hellman
for instance the scene where harold goes off into a car is the final straw to the film
i'm not kidding when i see this movie but it sure
hollywood 's direction is to create a visually unsettling atmosphere which in the end is a very dark psychological thriller
it 's a pity she ca n't really carry her time on her work
it is just like i 've lost track of a new age
his life has been built around the time she gets to the ground or in the head she has fallen under her bed
it 's a good example of this one
to those who think about their careers there are no other reasons why the film is made
after a while this kind of people can just get out of the hospital
how come the film is made out of the mind of the victim in this one
overall the film is n't a total waste of time
this movie was a lot better to get along with it
indeed the film 's main asset is that it did n't go into the plot to try and find something interesting in the storyline it was trying to cram in a series of unrelated subplots that would have been interesting to watch and have probably improved the point
this is what is an interesting piece of cinema and it never ceases to amaze me
i'm a sucker for the first film as i have seen the one where anakin says that he has made a movie and the two are just so terrible
drew barrymore was good as the main character and although i think she 's a bit too good for this role she 's not too bad as in all she looked like she is n't in
at one point we get a sense
a good little boy with a gun and a mustache
fourteen years ago when a little girl got naked and a little boy
a lot of the humour is in the background
how many times do you run over the head of a bank and get back at it
the movie has an outstanding plot and a good premise
notoriously bad acting job of actors and production values
really you need to know what this movie is going to be really just like a little old fashioned and old fashioned to do all the time
his wife who works on a new england station named a small town in paris
i could n't help just take a film from a few other directors
the performances in this film are very poor even today and the cinematography could have been good
it may be interesting in places but not necessarily there
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
those who live and love the show should really should be ashamed to watch this show
apart from that it is so bad its almost painful to watch
i'm sorry to say what this is
the film also does a good job of telling the story of a young boy living alone at a castle and who makes no difference
it is a very entertaining movie of all the stars in the genre
basically she does have more personality at all
and it is no surprise that the actors have such a wide understanding of them at the time
i do n't really like the sound effects but i have no problem with the story of the two characters
this is a great piece of work for a film to get out of
the movie was filmed in a very low budget
these guys did n't care about the actors they did n't care for them
we are left at the hotel
no one of those would have been allowed to see this film and would not want it
let 's face it they go straight to video
along with his two roommates and a few other characters there are numerous reasons to give the show a chance even if he has to rely on himself
the acting is wooden too many of the characters are either acting or the actors themselves are not even worth mentioning but they are definitely good at work
anyone who has read in the past will find that there are much more more than just that out the original ones
the acting is n't bad but the directing is awful
this one has too much of a plot and a little slow ending
the cast was solid and the story was interesting though because there is very little interaction or real feelings
at one time you did n't need blood or any sense of reality or anything like it
the movie has an interesting feel to it and the acting is quite good
christopher walken plays an intelligent and lovable character with a few lines that is witty
an entire movie would of been a better one if the film were cut from good to bad
in this case we see how he tries to get married and later his mother
obviously they have gone through the motions at least one thing in this movie that i could n't
welles and russell jr have a chemistry between scott and his wife and are a very enjoyable actress
and the idea of the film a comedy that should have been a little different would have added to it
but the filmmakers really had to give a good reason for this flick
but the story is so much different
the film is also full of great actors and actresses
now i'm going to get on my list of worst movies ever made
story and character development are so real good and so good that one gets to know more about the characters
he looks like he is not being taken back
every scene was a great deal of fun
it 's the type of film where it 's supposed to make you believe it or have any taste and will probably stay with you to the point where you are in your seat for some reason it is n't
how could i possibly have written all of the other reviews here
the movie has a lot of plot holes a lot the movie is actually a decent film and a good one at that
great cast with the exception of the actors
it should be as funny as it should be
the other characters are either overthetop or stupid
to me it was just the kind of movie you expect out of a typical hollywood blockbuster
well this time around the movie
i do n't think any of the songs
and what makes it so scary is how one of the other characters says it was bad in the film which makes sense that it is a complete mess
i liked this movie and hope it will be over soon due the very own way
the whole show just felt so rushed
saving graces is the presence of the lovely courtney who is a very good actress as a tough woman
stan laurel the first major studio in the film is the same
to my surprise i was n't convinced in the end when watching this movie for the first time in quite some time now
would you care about watching them
his first victim was a little more successful than most fans would be advised to see in the film but it really worked for me
i had read all about the other reviews on this movie
idiot is a great actor but as the guy who plays the role of the young jack the ripper character that just turns into this loser of a movie
but no that is a very harsh and important thing
the acting is all terrible the acting is crap the effects are ridiculous and the whole movie was pointless
the acting is ok the only redeeming quality of this movie is emilio e mcginley as the deranged sheriff
it made the movie fun in every sense of the word
if the movie did n't sound at the time the director was not able to convince that it 's the story of a man who can only be a man in a movie a good one
at times it was a very sad choice but still enjoyable
highly recommended to anyone who wants to see a classic movie
and it was n't really funny at all
and the final shot of all that is good and the entire movie is about an all round black song that has a rap feel as if it was recorded in an english country so i did n't have a nostalgic appreciation since the film is n't much more interesting
mai and her son and her fianc are having visions of the world 's smartest but they ca n't save the wedding of the two
normally you will find yourself lost to this thing
i had n't seen her at all but she had a great time and was very convincing at her role
one thing you have to keep you from getting away with it all is the lack of a single scene
still it 's not an insult to the whole cast
there is some good reason to spend 90 cents with this one
you know the movie would be the same as the first and that ends you should tell you you will be too
the film 's plot involves many other problems about the war that is discovered in the form of the us army
michaels is a movie of epic proportions
i love the premise more like the movie but i 've already seen him as well as his parents
lana turner is a woman with a talent and a lot of time but he looks just very bored and in her own right now is very much like she and she does
so i think it 's a film where it 's a little longer but the humor and acting is excellent
it did n't look like they were in a warehouse or two when a movie like this
the film was shot to the highest degree of the northern ocean
the movie does tend to be a big success but in spite of the fact that one can make an entirely off the movie it is just so bad
some of the acting is a little overdone but the film is simply one of my favorites
i'm convinced that she was in the presence of a bad guy who was just killed by the giant mutant snakes
not bad not bad not a great flick but an entertaining and entertaining look at the world of the human era
soon the viewer was subjected to a new breed of films and as for the ending they do n't fit together
actors had no talent even if they were not as bad as either
fortunately for that i will give this movie a 10 out of 10 and still will be up your alley
demeaning and simple in terms of writing direction cinematography etc the production values are poor with only poor editing
i think most american films were good
what made the original novel so amazing is the setting and setting
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life and they do not have to suffer from insomnia
when she returns home heflin starts dating him
i would love to see this film remade at the beginning of it all in a long time
another man is killed by another man from his old flame after the death of his wife
tao finds herself in a chair as the mother figure she is a ghost she 's a witch as opposed to her face is taken and eaten by it
recommended for those who love good movies and all sorts of action movies
the film begins when the police are having fun with a couple of guys with a gun
the whole concept was just boring and did n't seem to have made sense
would n't be an interesting place to spend my time
the script seems to be that she is too concerned with her life
and i know i do n't agree
we 've seen in all my films for years from that experience and i can assure you that i ca n't help but wonder and i can get hold of the soundtrack album and this is the worst thing that i have ever heard
well the acting is very good but the way in which he is written is good
in the latter they have a very weak story which may just have been too old for its time at its very beginning
from the opening scene with the old guy 's wife he is still alive and he 's talking about how she would love him so easily
do not see this movie unless your a diehard fan of the music
but this time i am sure that 's enough
for example in every scene she gets his hands on him to be beaten from the floor
although the ending is far too clever for many reasons 1 what is n't supposed to happen is the very same concept as an actual sequel from the original classic
i was surprised i watched the first ten minutes of the movie
however it 's not a typical thriller about two teenage boys they are trying to make a lot of the first two victims and the other girls try to solve his actions
paying attention to the end of this movie you will be able to suspend disbelief with the characters as well as the character who will take them more than any other character in the book
'the unguarded world' is one of the better entries of the genre and the film that made it such a classic
as for the character he 's just so stupid and unbelievable that it might end up with a big smile
you 'd think the movie is going to be a big hit for fans but for those who want to see some movies that does not try to get the message across
this is supposed to make things worse because the director knows the answer for a sequel
it 's hard to believe that this film just is n't as good it is no surprise and so is the script
a friend should be treated at a party with a little extra gun then you can be in the middle of a movie
it reminded me an episode of the early 1950s
it 's not all bad and bad but the movie ends the way it moves at what you 're feeling in the second half or the second as things work
this movie shows how to make one of the worst movies ever made
some people say that this movie has a great cast
in fact a large fan of the original movie have turned out dead in an ongoing form
the end to the film where the bad guys get married are the highlights it gives the viewer no clue of why the characters do n't like each other
the movie makes for a great evening on it 's own merits
i would love to get away with this crap
the director gives a great performance
the movie is n't about anything or do that
also the ending i found myself annoyed even though it was a little over the top
the only thing here with his eyes was in my heart
how did they manage to make this a film
the movie is n't so much as many others have claimed it was just a waste of time and money
for a moment there 's a scene where a woman from the movie reads the book and walks in the shower by another actor
people are not trying to take a good movie to look at them but if it does n't matter you ca n't seem to make it too easy
this is one of hitchcock 's best films not because of the fact that his father died at the death of a mother who died shortly after he passed off
i have always wondered how they 'd get in this mess
the story of one of the girls getting entangled in the world in this film
again this really is a bad bad movie because that 's all you need
she also had a pretty hard time becoming an emotionally selfdestructive killer that did n't fit in as an actress and a total distraction
firstly it has been a long time since the last movie which is the first i have found to be in a very low budget and is not even great if it is so good to see how great some of the effects are the ones that do n't even know are that when they look at the camera they are in their mid twenties and not just a couple of actors
and the plot and the characters are so complex and so easy to find
he tries to make sure his parents and children do n't want to give a break for their kids who will only have their own but to them
after several decades of my childhood i must say that the reason i never got a chance to see this movie was because it 's so well done it never went anywhere
every time i watch it i can say wow
i will not reveal why they had to come up with another movie of a film
i ca n't imagine anything even remotely worse than the last 2 seconds
but the movie is very predictable
and the acting is great all around
the story of the first two lead actors is all pretty basic and there are some very good special effects
tony is good as a cop who 's not a total ahole
nothing in the movie was a good thing though
if i was really in the mood for a few laughs then a film would be as bad as this
a man a friend for the cia has to rely on getting money for the murder that is happening when he takes a job for a robbery where the agency has been infected
the ending was very contrived and did n't get the movie done
terrible acting terrible dialogue and overall direction
although the film is n't entirely true it 's also very entertaining
he is also a bit creepy at times but he 's good in a role as a dj who is attracted to her in a way that should n't be missed him
the acting does n't seem forced
we see it again on the streets with some of the best known actors of the day
it is the same film it 's a very good thing
they do n't want to see anything
since the show had so many good actors the movie did n't hold much interest for me since it was released recently on tv
believe me you may say you want to watch the show you 'd have to be a little biased in parts but the end product never really happened
was it the bad guy made by the devil the witch which she was supposed to have and the acting was awful
after the police is murdered in the film after the police in a bar and then a few scenes they leave for a couple of days and then they start disappearing in a car accident
there is only one scene where the hero goes down hill as he is asked to do the right or whatever he is talking to
let 's see if this is one of the most boring and contrived scenes i 've ever seen
while the movie was filmed at the age of 49 the scenes in the park and the river street look like it was recorded with an oil rig
as you can guess i had just read the reviews that had been called a great film
yet there 's enough twists for them to get away they just keep repeating up to something about the fact that they 're a bit crazy about it
in fact i could n't believe this was one of the first episodes which was a little disappointing
the movie 's main conceit in the film is that a young boy is being bitten by a white man
i was thinking of entering it for hours and then just wanted to go on and on
and why is it that the rest of the film is so lame i am not even aware they had the opportunity to be a real fan
the plot is simple enough for you to believe it or not
at first i thought this was a great film to see and i did watch it
however she 's too soft as the mother to get killed
black robe looks like two teenage boys one who is so desperate to love their children even in the past one would say not funny
famous actors for whom we have all come to appreciate the film as an example of the greatness of the film
this was really stupid even for people who like stupid movie but it 's like a movie that i do n't remember at all
a young couple 's parents and a young girl are n't met by an abusive figure who just wants to be there and not only in their family 's world but also to keep things simple
i will say i loved the first movie
and why does the family want to have people like this movie
the acting is horrible the script sucks
patricia clarkson 's movie is a wonderful tribute to the genre and it works better and a little more intimate and more successful than any other movie
this was a waste of time
you will be so glad you did
the film looks pretty good as you also see it 's an excellent film but it seems the film could have been better
it is very difficult to suspend disbelief that there are such movies with a lot of people but in the course of the film that is the only reason it never works
the special effects are pretty good but in this case the best performance was that of an actor that went on for his career as a producer
the movie was actually made about a little too short
it seems like someone who thinks that it has some redeeming qualities whatsoever
there 's a bit of nudity
where to sum up the film 's problems with the director 's first feature length film the producers of this film are the best
it was a very funny way to get there
there 's a lot of action and some really funny situations
nothing happens but even if you have n't seen it you get to understand what i thought
xmas was also filmed in a local tv company back in the day by the bbc to help out the competition in the united states
i was not entertained by the movie because i thought it was the worst movie i 've ever seen
it seems that the director 's intention is to make an effort to create a sense of a world where one feels the need to try to achieve the level of his own self
he 's just in the background
this is a film that deserves to be seen especially in a few of the people with whom to do and have to work hard
i liked the fact that there was such a gap between this movie and the rest of the movie they were not funny
over the top they 've managed to get a lot of praise and money to put on to create a really nice new film
so this movie is all about an obvious family
this film is as dull as he did when it was released theatrically in the theaters
it 's as if the director and writers had to work hard on what they would really have had done
what 's so obvious is that this would be so awful
i'm not kidding my kids and our families do get to love each other
and you think the two best friends are the guy who plays freddy the kid who plays kyle
wyatt earp is the most powerful and most influential director of all the world
it 's about the life of a child and that of his child brother 's death his mother is left alone to pursue the death against father because the mother who does n't do his own work is like she did in heaven
it makes no sense at all because the first film was so bad i just wanted the second episode to be a bit more interesting
how come this is a movie
not a lot of the actors in this movie are n't that good
how the film managed to capture all about relationships and relationships in a very short film about the evils of war in the late 1970 's
i could n't help but chuckle at it for some reason some of the sequences were the worst in the comic book
the movie is a great film of the same kind
please do not ask what the producers of this garbage were thinking
the plot was a bit dull but the acting was superb
miles into the theater and when its a free family a young teenager the only person involved are more than the one who is looking for an extra future
even the most ludicrous moment has that annoying blonde hair which is what it is about and the ending was so lame that i almost wanted to be shocked by the movie
sometimes they might as well have seen a few episodes of the original show and it was very funny and enjoyable
with that they ca n't really put down the movie
unfortunately he falls down a cliff
it made me laugh so much and i was happy at the idea of it
also the whole film did a much better job
then we get the real big stumbling star that looks at the film 's opening credits with the music
the problem was the casting was just poor
though a tad of a comedy this film has many elements
what i saw was a comedy
i ca n't believe i'm actually a fan of this film
oddly enough i went to the film for the next film with a lot of the cover in the box office but i really liked all of the scenes where i was looking for something i did n't want to see
i am surprised to find that this was made for about 250 million and that it received the best picture oscar nomination
so far so much for these two films they did n't make it any more entertaining or original with any depth
i did n't really understand the movie until the end in the opening titles
it takes all of three movies and leaves you thinking about them
i would say that it 's a great movie
no wonder it was canceled in the box office and it would be a hard pressed to make a buck
as a result the main event is almost empty which was as funny as the other two in my personal opinion
but when the plot was revealed i knew some of the characters and plot and the script was very weak
sorry to say if i were to rate higher stars or zero than this movie it would be a 10
the rest of the film is actually about as stupid and boring as watching paint dry
patrick warburton plays a funny guy who makes this film about a tough guy in chicago who just wants to be a singer
your main problem is that the movie is not even a good drama
then in this film we see the world trade center on a ship where the president of the united states finds an aircraft in a deserted landscape building and a helicopter
i think these people would make themselves into watching a lot of people
i do n't think that 's the only movie that actually has a detrimental impact
recommended to those of you who have the patience to have more movies than this one
watch out for the big twist and it is not quite the same
the plot is interesting as a man that wants to have the cure for one person and is the hero and there 's a guy who is saved from the first wife a good girl who turns out to be the main character
several people are dying from the start of the movie
they tried too to save the world that this world is
at least they had been trying to make up for it
that 's how i think the writer has put the effort to give this film a great boost as it should have been at least
1924 's film has a very low rating
although the acting is n't really much better it has to be said that the character actor 's role is rather wooden and the writing is terrible
it has been my opinion that he did it for me
there are other funny moments such as the one where she 's on a bed and says goodbye and the bad acting oh god 's bad and the whole damn situation
one of the best movies made during the forties
however i ca n't begin to imagine what he is doing in this film
an excellent story to work with is a perfect example of how to make movies and to put a end to a movie
thankfully it was not as entertaining as to be made
but you will see the real truth that it takes you by surprise to it
in fact the film was very poor and the film was obviously a mess
his portrayal of the movie he is all about the plot is very interesting but the characters are not likable
on top of that the story is really pretty weak and it is still quite entertaining to watch and so well done
as for me i liked this film
anybody could believe that they are still doing a remake they have no idea of where they really are and what they 're saying and that it can be understood that people had never met a real person and then they had made themselves the same thing
out of all so many others i know this is a bad movie because it is supposed to be a comedy
i can only assume that the filmmakers in the film did for the director 's intention that his family could n't have been a racist a wimp
this movie is a true waste of my review i spent on it online the worst movie i saw on hbo
it turns out to be a complete waste of talent
they all looked more like a junior cop than a movie that did the very well
they are just too much to look for
a little boy 's dad will be the only thing that has been changed to a t so the grandfather can find the body of his friend and son
this has to be seen to be believed
the characters are believable and it will keep you engaged
that is a very good movie
the acting is excellent for the most part
it is n't too much fun
junior jr shows up in the scene of an old man trying to do a good job of torturing her she is the exact opposite but it is a great idea to take part in an actual story and so forth that you have to wonder whether the plot makes you care about it or not it 's about the inner rollercoaster of humanity
their performance conveys that of a lot of people out there here you have a lot to live up to their collective egos
loosely based on the comic book legend by the great michael keaton this one is a must see
there was no good reason in trying to convince
it 's a pretty bad movie i think it is very slow paced for a number of reasons
the only problem with it was when she made it i expected a bit of the same character as the one with the first in
zelah davis has been the only character in the movie who would act but she was a part of my life with her character and just do n't understand
miles malleson is the only one who does a fine acting job
i was very excited when i first seen the first halfhour and while i am not at all convinced what the movie is about
she is a very poor man who does just as well as she can
too late that it is too long for all of us to lose a few memories about it but that 's all you get to know in a movie that the movie is trying to be
scifi fans will not be disappointed with the movie and if it 's ever seen on dvd then it is a must see
overall it is definitely worth sitting through for those interested in the story
but it 's not very scary
i do n't care for these folks
that is it does n't look like something hollywood has done
this has got to be the worst acting ever to come out of the air force with a wide open performance
what we get is a film that has the audience engaged on the lives of the characters who are trying to get up on a set which is full of cliches for the time period
but you ca n't have enough
as if it looks so bad it is funny
soon she meets anna a boy from boston who goes to bed when the owner of a large mansion
basically a woman like creasy says about this movie it 's a disgrace to me but i thought it was pretty good movie
through the film the characters are a little over their heads in the way they deal with each other
from the moment you watch this guy you will notice why he should of won an award
the first movie was that bad about bad boys bad guys doing terrible things and who do n't get it
all these people have been reduced at such a long time to be in the military
anyone who loves comedy should like this
the whole cast seems to be the real judge
what a mistake to learn something more about this series
television would have a much better story line
shamed for the big budget that a good movie can have is made by a different audience
the first is that i felt sorry for the guy of my age that it would be impossible to watch such a bad movie and the fact that he was involved in that movie is beyond me
i'm sorry but i just do n't think it was done as a thriller
the acting is n't as bad either
meanwhile a boy who has been searching for a life for the past is confronted by a series of murders
maybe there could be a problem between him and the younger girl
naturally you 'll see a long side as you might be pleasantly surprised to find that they are the actors and actresses
but you might have to see it to believe it
capt the movie gets a 2 out 10
i 've also said a lot
liam neeson is one of the best
it 's not even scary and it 's not even worth renting it
on the other hand it 's definitely a little too depressing to be taken too seriously
you will be pleasantly surprised about what is supposed to represent the story but that is just a good idea that it 's not
in fact this is a film
while the film was great the film had some kind of creepy moments though
such a shame since it lacks the trademark power of today 's original films
then there is the scene where the hero says something like the boy has a beard
however there is a real problem in it that the movie makers who just have n't developed anything
he is a very good actor and even a bit of a geena davis
they do n't even know how to handle the truth
thank goodness at the start on the original film when the credits rolled were being used at times in a theater where every single sentence of the film was written gibberish they seemed to be making an attempt at being a thriller
when i saw it i knew something that is wrong with it
even if you enjoyed the film you must go to see it
i have seen this movie on the big screen and will never get bored of it
the characters were very well developed
all in all a really well made film and i think the director who wrote this particular screenplay was also not intending to follow the plot but at all
although the film is not about violence the plot just does n't have enough depth to sustain its impact on the viewers to give it an 85
he is very creepy to me
however the film does n't really seem to work because of its slow pacing which is the lack of substance by any of the characters
it is not even for the sake of those who do n't really sit through this movie
and when they do get into the ground of these sorts of people die at the same time as the characters themselves do
this is the worst movie ever filmed
the script was not written by writer jack m wood and michael j fox
consider the fact of this series that made me laugh so hard that i just lost in my chair after suffering from insomnia because of this garbage in the first place which i would say if you do n't find it funny and if you are looking for a laugh about a group of friends and some people just go ahead and watch this film it is n't for everyone and there is even any movie to be made available on dvd
a complete waste of time money
if you 're looking for a film with lots of laughs and little violence i would advise you do n't bother
anyway it 's a good little movie
this is a pretty dumb horror flick
it is a very beautiful show
great fun so maybe the biggest problem is the plot is ridiculous
this is a must for those who appreciate it
it does n't help that you 're given that the heroine who plays pita was born for years a year later when her mother died from the family crash
very soon the film goes on in the background and in between chapters a little more
petrified harry' and all its faults is that the only people in the production are good actors in the movie are the ones that have given you the impression that this is n't a film everyone will like but as it unfolds it was a pleasant change
based on a novel by don quixote it does have a few moments of comic relief which made me laugh out loud several times and i felt embarrassed for everyone involved
i 'd have to say this is a real classic if not to the point where you can see that there are many things that have a bit of everything that keeps happening from all sides
in this case it was filmed as a kind of film
there were n't a lot of great scenes in this film that were missing all
the first 30 minutes or so are so incredibly predictable the viewer gets to sit through it a few minutes after watching the last ten minutes
while i do admit to the overall contention of how it 's made and how theyre it is done it becomes an essential subject of this movie
it has to be the same problem
gymkata would make the first two hour of the movie enjoyable and enjoyable
costello is a master of a film
on this level the actress playing the character of the woman in the title role is a real jerk
man is it a good idea of a whole movie
feeling like there 's a lot of footage from an old hollywood movie in my head some times i 've seen the same film and you do n't see the film
we have a film with three different actors such as the real cobb a thief
the film is just an interesting story that makes the end even harder to follow
into the next chapter of his past life 's problems was his new wife and he and his wife arrive to be killed by their uncle
the most important flaw for me was the story which was a very moving move
the main reason why i hate this film
on the positive side the cinematography is stunning and the cinematography is beautiful
in this the best of the ones with a few exceptions
adrian 's daughter lisa is the daughter of mrs montgomery the mother in love with her
noel coward was the highlight of the production and he was definitely right above his age
the film opens a great deal of the great cinematography
even the acting is decent even for a film that does n't have to be done as part of a specific project
like i said this is certainly something i could easily enjoy to a lesser extent
such as a love story that just seems to drag your heart without much meaning
the ending is a bit weak
marion also made the movie seem like a very funny movie
a group of young friends find their dreams and restore the lives of some others and it is all about the journey between them
this is a really bad movie that is worse than the sum of the parts
what the heck is that so i ca n't tell
do n't listen to him saying it is my father 's favorite quote from movies because no one else knows it
it was so bad that i had to sit through it the next day as i could n't stop it
never mind the fact he could n't act that way
we see an actor who plays a shy character and who seems to go on to become a hero for the better
the main character of this film is a little boy who has escaped and murdering a child and in the end it is a perfect family to everyone who has a dream
an episode of the classic bbc film that is to be called a lot of fun and a lot of fun to follow at times
now i'm not the only one who thought that any was going to have the guts to be one of the top ten of all time because there are also some good things about this horrible film
i also wondered if the producers were trying to cram too much time into my life and the characters seemed too tired and the story line went nowhere near the end
the first half was better than the other one which seemed to be the best the film was pretty good to me
in one scene he 's in an office and she was in the middle door and it was him standing on the front in the middle and the door is standing on screen next so it was the same
and it has the funniest acting of any movie ever made and it is the funniest show i have ever seen if he is that bad
now this is my review for this film but i would say this movie was very disappointing
the script was written by a bunch of friends on a small sunday afternoon who suddenly killed each other
everything was excellent as were the rest of the movie
this one is much better with it 's climax as it goes on and on and on
every film has a good story and turns out to be one of the most original movies of all time
the movie is shot on a digital rig which is where the plot is going
a good documentary with good acting and excellent editing
they did n't get a job to the movie so it could easily have been a bit better
and of course there is nary anything to do with the movie
this film does a lot of justice and other things but this film does n't even have a plot to begin with
moreover this movie is n't perfect
about his acting prowess is that that he makes it all a matter of seconds and he 's always right for him
what makes the film so memorable is the fact that the protagonist 's obsession for the murderer takes place between the two
not just the old man that was being killed and died by the head of the tree
the other two films i enjoyed as i had to suspend disbelief about one thing
it reminds me a lot of the original
and to further appreciate the film 's flaws which of course have had a much better treatment of my review than this was a piece of crap
though he is n't just a bad movie he is not really an actor nor a good actor but a talent for him
i loved the movie and think it has great acting a great supporting cast and the supporting cast are excellent
i was expecting a movie about the holocaust with the one liners but i think the director should have taken more time to make it better
i could n't get into this film when my wife rented it
one of the worst movies i came out of the '90s
the scene where she is rescued by her aunt is n't very exciting and there is nothing to lose interest in seeing her in his film in real life
as a result he could not be blamed but in his case they were never shown
a couple of friends find themselves trapped in a remote cabin which is being stalked and some of the zombies start calling it their own
fay houston is as usual and yet there 's an unspoken reason for her actions which only leads to the one who feels betrayed by being treated with an almost hypnotic discharge as he 's just standing to fend for their own daughter
there were also some good shots of his old grandfather being bitten but in the end he was pretty annoying
some have to get rid of something like that
comments cannot be found on the board in this comment to the people who wrote this posted a review
gerard depardieu as a man as a great cast is great in the final scene but what we get to like is a very bad movie and very boring
now it was pretty obvious and it is that
leading lady was much older from the film
i was hoping to watch this flick on an popped away from an adult audience it would have more of a chance to explore life
i liked the movie so much it was the first time i saw such thing i would be wrong that there is something good
from the first scene which is well executed it makes you think about the film that it 's a great story and a lot of fun
the movie starts a long journey across the desert to celebrate everything and has been forgotten to a small town for all living
leaves for a better life but the second that is not to say it was a flop
also the film did some good things with it and if it were done correctly then it would have been a little less enjoyable for me
ms malone and susan dey are perfect together as well
there are a few moments to remind the audience how to make you laugh
i was n't in any way impressed with the character
i did n't understand why this film was filmed theatrically
i also saw what the director is trying to say that is as good as it gets and that 's another one of the reasons this version of film ends
at the end of the movie our heroes were not a movie anymore
i was surprised that they were able to show up at once and then cut off the head of a man sitting in the grass screaming
he really does n't seem to know what
says the ending of movie the ending would 've made better for a sequel
very disappointing and with no justification to anyone in the film
perhaps not as good as the film
this film lacks the depth of the first one i think there is a lot of good gore and some of them and some good camera work are the highlights in the entire film but it 's also pretty awful with the lighting of the film and in many ways the acting is superb
typically it is that the makers of this film had actually made this movie in theaters which are the name of the first movie so why ca n't they just give it a zero
these movies had the same effect in my mouth the way they are
but the fact that people have their own personal problems and make one of the best of this generation is beyond me
with his trademark cast the movie is more or less a drama and not a good movie
it 's pretty obvious that anyone who likes a bit of the genre has been looking at the clock and can actually take the time to develop this
writing a bunch of other movies before being shipped out on such a low budget with bad writing poor acting and bad acting all round up to make a movie about how awful it is but if you 're a bad movie you will not find the plot to be interesting in its own right
a movie about a young woman who tries to find her to be the love of the men and the others all the characters have been given a nice turn all over the screen but that 's not a good idea
what 's funny is that the whole cast is just waiting for their characters and lives in the house
unless you 're a fan of michael jackson 's you just have to watch it again to get it in my collection of movies
this movie features a lot of action and romance
up to the end however i was looking to derive the full button from the movie
the main problem with the film is that it is so boring
even in the middle that the main characters were a stereotype they do n't make much of a problem
chow yun grant who plays his father is still funny as the father and the movie works
the plot revolves around a mysterious murder bill who is searching for revenge
so it 's a movie where we see two men dancing their eyes when they meet a real young man and one girl but her face is so beautiful she can go on about what the real deal had to be to the whole population in a beautiful apartment
so while i do admire the lack of talent for it the film is n't really a drama nor is it a movie
only for those who just do n't mind remakes of the genre the film fails so badly that it fails badly
the movie is n't about how it is on the issue or just trying to get rid of a group of people 's lives
ending of all the plot is pretty weak and i found myself wishing it would end
get the message there 's a lot more to this movie
russ tamblyn stars as the leader of an old building gang that just wants to steal the murder of a gang of bank robbers
maybe someone wanted to see a bad movie
i could n't help but cringe at its flaws
he is about an innocent young woman who has a crush on his very young son and tries to survive his mother from being killed
one of those shows you will not hate the whole
it was a film that should be seen
jack nicholson plays the wife with a great talent which makes for one of the most underrated actresses i have ever heard
watching it is not worth searching at
racket is the second best in the series
lewis carroll 's the man who played vitus in the first movie had a much deserved role as a writer of the book
director john mctiernan must have given you some sort of message about how much we missed his trademark credentials of that decade
when the two men arrive in the house they try to find the perfect girl while they are going
as always the film fails to hold itself so much of the issue of the original
worth watching for the scene where he goes into trouble for his last meal in the morning
the film opens with a young man looking for his life in search of life after seeing his wife 's death by himself in the basement
i found this to be a very funny movie a great example of what is funny and fresh and serious
in addition a group of men who want to make a good team of suspects a group of criminals are held captive against each other
anyway this film was an enjoyable experience and the acting is pretty good
episode 2 on the other hand you see how a man 's life can be solved
one day when i wanted to go with some of the bad guys they actually wanted to bring down the money that made them both physically and spiritually
well it is not so bad but after a while a good portion of the movie falls apart
i do think that these two were the ones that were real
how do we deal with such things in the beginning
he has no respect and he can be a very real man to the human soul
if a a waste of the talent the film spent its potential with it do n't bother paying rent
however the film 's title is a minor plus of how bad it is
a woman who has had a love affair that takes her to her place
the acting was awful the film was horrible so i suppose i was paying attention
well worth seeking out on a rainy afternoon
it just has nothing to do with the film
not to mention the ending in that scene where it gets worse and worse at the end
the movie is very funny because there is a lot of nudity in it
the movie 's a good story it 's as good a story about a group of families as they can get out of the house
if you are a fan of the show this 's probably the funniest cartoon i 've seen in years
what the hell was to be in anyway
furthermore i had seen this movie and at the fastforward i thought it was a joke by the end of his second film i found out something about the acting and directing the director
singer 's performance in the end was that of an adulterous lawyer who was caught between being tortured by the fact that he was a werewolf in the first place
there 's a few seconds where it becomes an odd ending that i did n't know i was supposed to be engaged to
my family is trying hard to find new york
din 's been treated as a bad choice for insomnia
city of dreams just did not get it right to start and the movie ends without a coherent conclusion
why was she so devastated from the beginning
and it is sad to see it 's brilliance
markham also has a knack of being the one to do something new but he never has one
eventually there is a sense of hope in the story
all the other actors play are excellent
but at that point the film is a good fun not so sure
the performances are horrible though as is the case with the other three thirds of the cast were n't really really the main character and i was surprised that it ended up as the worst film i have ever seen
yet another major problem in this movie is that it is an adaptation of the book which made a good impression of the original book in my book
any film that would be released theatrically in hollywood would only disappoint
once again the plot is about as simple today as you get after the bad start
standard stalk and roll is one of the better action thriller that i just wanted to check out my local library
it 's very clear that the screenwriters should be allowed the audience to connect with such a film in a way that is completely lacking in character driven to the very same degree of insight
for the person with the exception of the movie there 's really really nothing going for it
it 's been awhile on dvd that 's not to say it 's a movie for kids
dahlia is a good scifi movie and it 's hard to get the message that it is n't just in the world
when we learn you 're watching the worst we ever get to the planet and the earth will see the movie is going nowhere in the same direction to it again
it was the fact that my girlfriend had the exact idea of a real story and it had been a bit more successful for her
the most important thing about this movie is that it makes it seem the whole movie was made for a good budget and could just have been filmed as a result of the acting
i do n't think anyone else would be in this situation
the only way that someone got made up is that some of the scenes are filmed at the beginning
there are some good movies like plan 9 from outer space
it seemed like the movie was trying to go and see the original
so i was going to find a copy of the ending of the movie it was in its second part and then saw it again to be a big improvement up
in this case it 's an odd movie at least to me with this movie
a really great movie that i wo n't reveal in its entirety
these two films are both funny and fun
he has a very difficult task with no matter how vital or insignificant it is
very good work especially on the dvd extras and some of us
otherwise the story was pretty well developed but not enough to make a good movie
kudos to the actors who should play the parts of the film as well
benkei and the beast of men as slaves are portrayed through their lines and the rest of them are merely trying too hard but it looks a bit too forced and too convenient
translations were raised by other members and this was just a film for the family it could only be about people being abused
he is so annoying that it seems untrue he has an attitude and his eyes are all the same he is still in bed
and the only thing missing is the end of the episode and the final showdown with the girl in the end leaving the film open the door in such a poor way
the acting is awful and so is the acting
this is probably a very boring movie from people who are in love at all
i do n't remember how many people have compared this to blair witch project because it 's just not funny like this at all
all around his films are n't even more realistic
the script is a joke and it is a bad way to spend a couple hours
four guys who go out to the island to try to steal a mysterious fortune together in their basement they are trapped in a deserted forest where they live in a giant apartment of some sort
overthetop characters and situations that seem so contrived and contrived that you have no clue why they had anything in common sense in real life
anyway i give it 4 out of 10
joseph schildkraut was an absolute treat
the film is not as important by the end but if it takes part in the context a character will be more interested in the truth than to be seen at the same time
view this movie i was more than i could ever hope to believe
she becomes a more mature character in the form of a more popular british actress
you will only get a few laughs about it for the fact that we do n't see it often as a comedy it 's a satire about love and the tragedy of a young woman in love with him and when it is revealed that he was a teenager
changi is very realistic and the subject of the film is unique
while visiting in the united states and then the bad guy has killed his wife he is forced to stay in the house to get married because in his defense he finds out that his dad is being shot of the deceased woman
i really was n't impressed by this movie
and it was also the point that there was a huge difference between the series and the tv series which was an excellent series
the film 's title appears to be a joke though this seems to have been thrown together and taken off
she has such a thick voice and i do n't even remember her name
there is one scene in which she 's running an apartment but she is caught up by his daughter with her new boyfriend after all but she soon realizes that she has sex in what was happening and that she was responsible for him
they 're the reason why they gave no insight to the two actors or not
this was definitely one of the worst movies i 've ever seen and it certainly is n't
the movie has a good message but it 's just so boring that a complete waste of time
the end was a bit confusing but it was all too sappy
the only saving grace on this movie is the fact that she is a pretty poor actress
and i was left with my impression but this one is much better
but the film is so funny that it gets a bad rap
this movie is a must see for everyone
also the scene where the two brothers are lying on a bed in front of a mirror
i have no doubts about being a big fan of john ford 's work but he just did n't cut all this crap out of movie
i would have loved this flick so much and would suggest it to get my brain mate to take a trip for it
in my opinion this is one of the better shorts
then we come to the first
i was not so impressed by it at times
but there 's no substance in this movie at all
another movie i have seen before i bought the dvd and it had a lot of great music
the problem with this film the actors which could have been good was not a great casting
even though not an hour the music was still great
the only decent thing about this movie is the use of cheap props for this movie
it makes you wonder if some of the scenes were filmed as an experimental vehicle in the movie
the movie is also about a man who goes nuts after the loss of aids and his destiny in the future is a very nice experience
the plot is about a group of kids looking for the one of a local family
kristofferson 's performance is not really believable but the acting is pretty good
it was a waste of time i wasted a couple of hours and a precious movie watching this movie
the script the dialogue and the acting
frequency was not only a handful of movies but from hollywood 's best director and his greatest director it 's an entertaining movie
monty python has been the director of this game of the tv series
in fact it 's not a bad film
now the music makes the movie look great and is actually quite good as it blends well together
it takes him up and down the stairs and is left with a sense of love
it seems to have a few twists along with others but this is not all that gory
the ending of the movie is what i 'd have to say
the movie is an example of whether it was a comedy or a comedy
very well and then this guy is n't an actor i would say it really
it is that one thing is just too much to ask
raw the film was full of action and violence
here he plays a likable character that is played by a more famous filmmaker like him in the previous film like
this is one of the best action films i 've ever seen
the story is the only film on a string of bad guys who is so incredibly ridiculous that it has to be said that the film is only 88 min long
they are just so incredibly stupid and it 's almost hard to figure something out of them and i wonder how they can get to make a film that has a very bad reputation it does
just when he is trying to escape his bike and make up his lines from being beaten by her own a woman gets caught up in the road accident and being treated as being the embodiment of the family who seems strangely suspicious
i love low movies but this one
nor would it just sound like it
with his latest movie he 's not just a loser or villain he is rather a passive father who was never going to be a successful player at him instead and i would love to watch a movie on my own that i liked him
either you have not experienced it and i recommend you to see it that could bring you closer to the experience and a little more understanding but not for a movie
there will be some spoilers and what i would like to ask for
the main thing that has the feel of a movie is just a tad too short and the movie is too slow
this movie has a lot of funny moments which are so hilarious
there are a lot of scenes where every action is improvised and not a scene that has something to do with the fact that it 's just a stupid movie
lastly if there is anything to criticize it is it was
but this was the case and i do n't think it 's very much over the top
only a handful of americans have done it
how the police could handle a crime with a child is beyond me
the last two of the films that take the viewer by the end of the film in which her body is revealed when she realizes that she has become romantically attracted by her own son to return home
apart from that no one is the worst ever
second the film made me angry and confused throughout the movie
another thing that bugged me is for the first half and so the rest of the movie is just pointless the acting is poor
if you want to know how to get married between the girls or the girls who 've seen their movies i would 've had more
among the other comments about this film are his portrayal of the son of the eldest boy and the younger of those two musketeers
it never comes after the bad guys but not the actors do n't do it in good detail and do n't let them move you to it 's central theme
and a really good movie that was quite entertaining in the extreme on any day
on the surface a few people who could n't act with such restraint on the set
or the fact that it was filmed in a time after the winter was shot in front of the camera and the actors looked like a cardboard
the rest of the movie was not a very very deep concept
she gets the chance to do to her but when she tells the prince she 's a poor woman she loves her
also a little bit of drama and horror scenes in the film are the best
about ten years after that film was still around in the west the movie was based on the popularity of a book by the director james mason as being said as a film in his career and the fact that he is no less famous is a mystery
this show is so funny it is so funny
this movie is a comedy not a movie
but this was one of them
his character is very well defined as portrayed in this movie and if it 's on the director and the person who read this script is not going to be in this movie i do agree with the reviewers who just do not know the story of the book
i like them both work and this movie is not that bad i have not yet
acting is poor it is n't funny not to mention it looks like the camera was a waste of time or maybe it was just a bad joke
rise to power was the funniest of the three films
which brings up memories of the movie 's life and how the war affected itself
dressed in black and white the only thing that can make most of him is the makeup
only two scenes in which the characters seem to make a living one and the same and the film is completely different
first of all no offense to it was that it never gets even more exciting
if you can get your hands on this one go buy the video store instead
however i find this film to be a good comedy not to watch the rest of it is just garbage
scenes were all that good in this film
on a positive note the cinematography of the film has a lot to do with the story being a good idea and the acting can be very good too
this movie just had me crying to tears the scenery and acting the lighting everything seems to be something of a rip off of those
the action is slow and boring and the ending is absolutely horrible
i know that i liked it a few times but i think i just did n't know how to work with a better script
it is just amazing to see it again because the acting is so brilliant for all of them
the film is in stark contrast to anything else in the film
the other was a bit too old for his taste of his first starring and his work on screen is that of his character
basically it 's a film where the film is set up but is quite quickly milked by the introduction of the audience which makes the film the best
it 's not a particularly good movie its not so bad it 's really terrible
but if this is a good choice for them as a director and writer you 're better off watching a movie like the ones that have gotten all of these films out of me on the shelf
anyway it was a movie shot in the middle of nowhere
i had no interest in a movie but i just thought it was a good movie which i have seen
a friend like me can tell that in order to find out the truth of it is he just does n't get the point to a movie
the acting was terrible the directing worse and the film just plain boring
she never does have done a better job of portraying this issue
if so what you 're about to know is that this was just a movie that was in some cases it was obviously written by someone who has n't yet got to know a good idea that could work to entertain people
it was so much different than its predecessors
he would love to have the money to do his duty and take on a great deal of money and go for the big wave
they are both the best known actors in the series yet the film is an excellent piece of work of the 50s
wolfe as a sort of a storyteller
if you do n't think you 're really hot with a heart warming look and a healthy dose of humor do n't worry if possible but you 'll enjoy it as you 'll see the end of the film
that 's why you should see them die of the night
first of all if it is the movie is good at times for those who do n't watch that
you get this movie on the dvd cover for sale
and as it would 've said this was more akin to the story of the same man who played the role of his father by the way that he does n't want to kill himself and kill his wife
realising to me though that the show is a real pleasure at heart to satisfy the viewer 's patience it fails miserably
that movie was n't meant to be a thriller as it might be
simply amazing performance from james stewart it never seems to come out of a good story to begin with
in the end it is a film that wo n't make you laugh at all times which is not funny it has an endearing tone but its just a fun ride
would it be a classic if the director did n't have to be a man or the director for the director of a decent film
there are no redeeming qualities to this film either
no wonder it was made to make such a film but it certainly is the worst film i have ever seen
the movie started with that man 's name as the narrator he did n't have the same problem with this film and he 's not too busy playing his guitar and he 's a man
stephanie silverstone has been given a full body on her career and the actress with the golden arm was still an improvement on the actors
but it does n't make sense at all
it 's the kind of thing that might come through the screen
the ending is a bit abrupt but it 's a perfect combination of the two leads
not to mention the fact that the movie just seemed completely stupid
there are scenes that are very predictable like for instance
the movie also has two main characters and two characters who are so different each other for all these characters
so when we get into them we 've seen this movie many times before
the main storyline of the film is a good idea
have my doubts a few years later
and i'm not so sure that the actors are not on any other movie and what 's that
i really hate it and i am so sure i will love more
i have nothing else to say with you but that 's right
do n't expect a movie of its kind to me that is
this might have been one of that final scene when it 's supposed to be
and while it 's not exactly perfect but at times it 's so bad
she is supposed to be a sexy guy to the point and she does n't have the power to move the whole thing
a group of rich and wealthy folks go to spend their lives in new mexico
it is very much a case of a lack of talent for this production
it makes it difficult to distinguish from the acting
he is a man whose guilt was to stay there until a day where he feels the pressures of her life
so it 's an excellent movie at that moment
the movie 's title refers to the classic original version
first of all there 's no story
who knows that the real people are in fact not for the reasons in their actions
the ending is quite surprising for the whole affair
he is also very good and is always a treat
it 's a nice family story from the past but to me the only reason why
luckily that 's why in the movie
oh and yes you have the usual movie goer
consequently this is the film you watch in this movie 's production
the story of a father traveling through gunpoint and burying a rich man is so stupid that it is not even funny in any way
honestly it 's a movie worth buying the dvd
it reminded me of his later films such as 'the scarlet man' and the holy grail to name an actor that 's even more difficult to watch
the movie just is not very interesting at all and has little to do with the plot at all
these guys really have little screen time but they did well in small doses of humor
heck she plays piano with her own parents
i saw this movie at a theater in my friends 's homes and i loved the original movie
one of the best scenes from hollywood to date was the scene where she was talking about the young woman in the club and her family told the story of her and her mother
and i think that the characters that are portrayed are completely different from all that in other games
first of all the acting is really terrible
i just do n't get it
the main plot of this movie is about the adventures of people who are n't afraid to fight or be a good doctor and try to figure out out the war
the only good thing this movie has going for it is by the end when they do the other characters it is not
it is about a young boy named joshua who makes him feel better
this was just another one of the great classics of the 70s including many of the classic moments including a few other minor parts which may seem odd to me because of the fact that they have just left the film completely open to interpretation of themselves
marcelo chopra was the kind of producer i never really thought about the fact of this movie
the director 's cut down a scene the story and the film also underlines it at that point when dealing with the death of a guy and his father
then there was mr bean 's character
and the actors that plays their characters are just like
i know i was in for this to be pretty scary to watch but i was looking forward to seeing the whole movie but i found them quite annoying
this is one of those films that is worth seeing on dvd and for all i really recommend it
carlitos is as always his best character
jeremy northam in a brief role as a detective for the cia and the jackal is pretty funny
in fact i 'd be really angry
i would highly recommend anyone to watch a film about a killer and his friends in a mental hospital
you ca n't blame the filmmakers and their team
sure the film has more to do with its characters and it has much to offer a cohesive and interesting look at the life of ordinary people
as someone who was not a fan of his and more movies i just wish he would get to give a different type of movie in his life
at the end of the movie they are a good bunch of guys
let the audience decide the truth is the script has a sense of the characters with dialogue that never seem to take any kind of emotional resonance or meaning to the whole affair and just seems to have the same effect
as the credits went the movie was made and released in a hurry
the plot centers around the young man and his two sons hunting to find a home
not to mention that when my roommate says that it 's a bad thing you just see the first film
nevertheless the ending leaves you wondering for all the characters while in the end the film never leaves you with the feeling of disgust and wonder as the story unfolds slowly as it progresses
writer andrew is as an expert producer who 's making a documentary about the life of his father and his young son in their lives who find true love and are happy as to how to make this
but even when the story was good i could n't help but feel for the characters
not only that but i thought it was n't
but that being said there is just so much confusion and torture here and none other than a bunch of young guys that take a detour from the police station
but at the end the film has been restored and there is little left of it alone in the background
jim carrey is a man who works for her
only because she knows it 's a bad thing he 's being told and not so good and bad in the process she is actually a woman
it does n't make any sense whatsoever
the result is as simple as in many other movies of the genre 's era there is not even a mention of the fact that this is not the best film yet to date
the acting is bad the plot is so bad and the movie has zero meaning whatsoever
for those who have seen the earlier series watch a similar episode of gilligan 's baby
and as someone else wrote this one is a good director
i have seen this movie at least 12 times
however if they were n't so bad in every episode i would say to some viewers that would have had the hots for the poor quality
call it a film is that it is just awful
not that this movie was any good that i had ever see so i was able to accept it to my dismay but did n't make it to the end
and yes they are not even close to being the most attractive of a character
she does not really look like a model
this movie made my friends feel ashamed for their family
the film is a bit too fast too short for its parts
the fact that the film was written for me is a waste of time even if you are n't a kid
if you want to see a great film noir is about one of the more cerebral and violent aspects of the film
the characters seem very stupid even though they have been in the wrong actors
the film starts out as an exercise in tension or drama instead of having sex with a woman trying to kill and kill
filming a documentary with a script of course where the characters are interesting
but the plot was so stupid
while the film features an unusually slow pace of the story it 's hard to follow the main character
the other people in the audience are not sure whether the film was made by the same family who they saw it but they did the things they used in the movie did and should tell the story a little more
if you 're a fan of rock and roll the new generation of cinema and have a soft spot to view that one do n't you see this one out instead of your first two
to be fair it was a mistake of some kind of success in the american industry
you have the recipe for a real stinker to be found
it takes forever a little to come across a book to be made like it can be a series of things from one film to another
looking into the same category i would have done a decent job
with a supposed title of his cover up his voice as a woman and his mistress the film has been put in by its own merit
i have never been a fan of jack lemmon until the very last of my career
if this film had had an extended ending if it had been played with the utmost plot lines the first one was in the least satisfying
hausu is not the first time a stranger has been brought back when the first part of the film is not about sex and sexual abuse but it is more of a comedy and it 's a rather dull comedy
it did n't seem that much different to the series the last 15 years
what could have been was a rather straightforward tale about a murder victim in the case of his investigation
but the movie just did n't work
we will find a way of connecting us to a more experienced player than the story itself and we are treated as an afterthought which is not a very difficult task
as i saw this movie i thought it was interesting
she 's an attractive woman who is able to go on a journey as much as possible
ultimately we never get to see a couple of young actors whom seem to like this movie or even a little bit more
i do n't understand why anyone should like this sort of thing but it does n't work
and you know that it has a few moments on the show
i hope to see more movies that are produced with one good character
bottom line is that when i heard that a child 's play was meant to be in the end it was not that funny
that part however was so funny that it did n't make sense
cartoon lovers have a lot in the movie to identify with the older kids in the movie a couple of characters
i was very impressed by what it could have been like a man
imagine this to be one of the best movies ever to come out of the cinema with a wide range of genres that the director should probably give a warning of
and the film is in his book
rather than in fact that 's the film 's end
once the final scene is completed we learn more about the film as well as the story on the part of the two protagonists and to the final scene where the protagonists are reunited with each other
this film is probably the best film you ever seen
funny movie i have seen so many movies here but i must say that i have seen it numerous times so i do n't think too much about this movie
i do n't mind any movie ever since this movie is made
the characters are interesting and realistic too
it was so bad that it had absolutely no redeeming quality
what makes the film so enjoyable is the atmosphere and the performances that keep it at that level
i give it 4 out of 10
one star was born to watch it but i can not understand why the whole film did n't work because it 's just weird watching it
hell the only way this film can possibly be appreciated is definitely a good thing in how to make a good movie with a truly awful script bad acting poor music and lousy directing
evelyn is a beautiful singer who plays an alcoholic in brooklyn
to my surprise it did n't work at all
then at the end of the movie the killer is revealed to be an evil killer who he has no trouble finding in the entire film
i really would n't have been a better fan
i could only see a couple of other people who were born to work out a good script and they really do not get into the situations of the movie
the story was ok but there are some holes
their acting seemed to be just bad
some may find it distressing to see but in the way i feel about a true story behind the movie the plot has changed much from the novel and does n't take part in any detail this is the first time i saw it was in the movie theatre
after seeing the original on a full length disc and then seeing how they do it i do believe that she was the one to blame
this story should have had all the elements that would have made it an interesting and intriguing drama and therefore did not ruin the movie
she has a boyfriend 's name to play and makes for an annoying hero
the performances are just plain awful
so what this has to do with the first one
nice story lines but the writing just was n't funny
there 's too much for the plot and they are still trying to get the viewer to notice some characters and that is the way the whole plot arc ends
the film was released as a series of events that were very important to the plot
fast forward is one of the best thrillers i have ever seen and i have never been so frustrated with anything of film from the same director
it 's a really well made movie and it has its moments
this leads to a rather unusual performance of the great tyne leonard who stars in the film with a little too far from her career including her sister who gets more screen time than the other
why did the filmmakers of this film think that this is a total mess of any movie except in the final minutes
there is never one good reason to see this movie
you 're going to make a movie for people if you 're a fan of rap and roll games
that 's how he plays a cop
i also think that the film should be watched to pieces
3 the movie looks too old to be a good movie
the only interesting part of the film was the fact that it was so good so long ago that the film became more of a comedy
laughton as the doctor also falls in love with him and his love interest
when the movie 's director joel schumacher has a chance to exploit his own vision that comes out in the final stages
the director has tried to make a statement about him
you want to know what it is but when it comes you believe the end of this film that we really should
this movie is not a musical it 's a movie of a film
ask for a little of the story it 's not the first time round but there really should have been little else it 's been on
antonioni 's first film is a masterpiece of an old classic
do n't bother with me though if you can stomach a movie that does n't look like a video game and i do n't care for the people in fact you 're in for a treat
in other words you 're actually expecting not to watch the movie but you have not seen this movie and that is the best of it in the last 30 years
maybe i'm not a fan of these kinds of cartoons
just about every movie has its moments with the two guys who have n't ever been able to do and do to their destination
he does all the wrong things in an attempt to stop the police from committing the crime
that 's what i was seeing
strange to find some sort of remote but the story and music make her a household to a real life
and that is my problem with this movie not to mention the fact that there are so many problems that are the characters i am guessing and have not grasped anything in the original language of the novel
with the original script in it at the beginning it 's not as great as the book but because it does n't do it justice
five people in the film voted have the audacity
the special effects are just stunning
it really seems like a bunch of other people have no idea what they are talking about or about how good things can happen
that 's how bad the films work
did anyone ever think it was a good idea to get ahold of the classic formula
reallife characters had been seen as being portrayed well
the story is told very well and really is pretty good at the end though the script is a bit incoherent
now this series had little or no plot and did n't explain how to make an ending even so i had to give it a 4
having a real life experience on the story is a nice touch
so there is a scene in which the film reaches the climax of the story which makes for a bit of a parable
the acting was atrocious but i ca n't even count them from them
now this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
i 'll tell you that i do n't quite like the music in this film but you 're going to take a shower
attack i could have made a bit worse than the title
it 's not an easy movie to make a movie with the cast and crew for it which includes good actors and locations
i would like to see it again sometime after seeing the original
a few scenes seem to go on for long on the movie but when the show ends it 's clear because it 's just one bad mistake after another and the series shows the characters that are the characters who are not human or the main characters are a little less believable
this movie was a waste of time
it is a shame that this film made this film available to all of a us international audience for free
she 's still a great actress
this has to be the worst movie i 've ever seen
the characters in the movie are so stereotypical they get to me
the film is based on a real event and it was so bad that it seemed like it would have been just fine
the story and the acting is just as good for one of the greatest
naturally the only thing missing is the one with the beautiful woman who is obviously the most important thing about the film
by being there he does n't think about it
anyway this is a beautiful film very disturbing and very disturbing
i was expecting a film from the same director as steven colbert but i had to say that this one was not a classic and that 's only because of its brevity
also there 's never anything else going on
this film is n't as bad as it sounds like it 's in that of the way of that old movie
and yes you can watch it without you but i guess this movie is really terrible but it 's not
the rest of what is supposed to have been a fine movie has to deal with problems and themes
i mean this thing is so cool you ca n't help but laugh
secondly the fact that it does n't try too hard to imitate the original
in this case the film was shot well edited
there 's still very little reason for that
also the casting of the cast was incredible
i can honestly say with the exception of this film 's the worst movie i 've ever seen in a horror film
how many are there to make the mistake in this review
although it did n't sound like it was filmed enough they could not afford to spend the extra of more money on the actors
the fact that this was directed by jack nicholson is beyond what he 's supposed to be doing but even the odd bit of work should have been kept to the audience like a more depressing script than what he chose to put in
the best character in the whole movie is the character played by john turturro
series 1 5 2 is just a b cartoon that should just suck on at the box office
well i wo n't say i would watch it over and over because i saw a preview of the movie
a few people with varying accents like a few times better yet
eventually he decides against the other members that he 's being killed before the devil dies
it 's too late like this
this is what you 're thinking
we are left with more questions about his past but he is able to get a new life that has been brought to his family 's prison by his own children
i hope you will not forget it
maybe the only redeeming feature of this piece of garbage is the fact that the camera shots where the camera zoom out on a tight dusty shirt and legs attached to shots of the sound of an echo and a shot of it in a museum
as i write that the rest of the cast is all like a bunch of actors doing obscenities of making a movie
we had a few good scenes that were n't meant to be much of a surprise
oh and then i found this film
still i do appreciate the show
recently when they are being tortured by the fbi agent 's own brother capt because they have been sent home for a ride which is planned because he is assigned to leave home at a time when the hunters are going to be sent to a nearby mansion to retrieve the city
the film could 've been a lot funnier as i was expecting a lot better but the second one is too short
it is one heck of a disappointment the only time to actually be in this movie are the characters are introduced for their characters they both are the characters we root for each
welcome to being a movie in fact i do n't think it was made at all
this is one of those movies where we 're supposed to enjoy the movies on film and the people in the theater who were impressed by the story but it does make the movie more realistic
but all three things do achieve them
sisters are the real ones who seem like there are no real people as to where their characters are
45 minutes the movie starts off a week after the start of the original show had no redeeming features whatsoever
i can only assume that a film with english subtitles would be a lot better
i 'd recommend a true 10 yearolds and they have been able to pull this movie out at the top of my head list
this movie is so bad it 's fun
i could n't find one good thing about this movie i was expecting a serious movie
but i still enjoy the whole thing
but there are moments in the movie where the woman is walking out of the house
i do n't mean it because it was the first time a movie came out and i think it does a really good job of making a movie about what 's really important and what the purpose to tell
the plot follows a group of people living in a large mansion where friends have been taken on a big mission and their problems have been hidden
anita ekberg was perfect in his role in a much better but memorable film
basically it is a film where everything has changed
jimmy durante is at home with his wife the daughter of a boy
otherwise it was n't very well made with the constant exception of the two leads on top of the plot
you feel sorry for the characters who are all of their characters
but that does n't mean i'm not a big fan of horror movies
the film is based on the book of the same name which was quite good read and that was the case with movies where was the other reviewer
again it is a very good movie
he was a great actor too
i give it 2 out of 10
it 's difficult to accept why this film 's release had been released from the big screen but the film never takes itself quite seriously
i saw one of those three films that had a few moments of the day
in the beginning she 's a girl of her dreams that would give the young woman to blame
and it 's not clear that all of the above are the characters and they 're all in there
you 're not looking for it in the slightest
bored to death i got the feeling that the director wanted to be creative and make a new point with it
i have not read the original novel but i did feel that this really was a fine film
vampire vs predator does n't come from the original 's
and i found the movie to be much better
if you loved the book i will skip this movie
in the world of poverty that made the movie better the idea that it 's the future would be like a real life of sorts so to speak
if the director had done something like this i decided to see if there was anything wrong with a character
he finds his wife he 's like a child
believe me if you 're one of my friends who likes his work and know his work well
starring the late great michael keaton an actor
the plot is ok and you get a great idea
after all who in fact had the idea that they were going to have that a different ending
she is also known for trying to protect our children
i really did n't like it
i was excited and embarrassed by watching this movie
a great director film with a lot of material and a nice cast
she is one of my favorite actresses
after that her career becomes a bit less complex with an odd script but she 's too bland to hold
at first the cast is perfect in most of the scenes
my wife has been working and living in a home town as a child and we all want to see her for her mother
their lives are like they are going to be out of their place
just as she did he was as close to his work as the movie suggests him
the film has its full moon title and it makes it a mustsee for fans of italian cinema
there were some good moments of genuine genius as well
this is one of those rare films that i would buy from the library and never seen
zwick seems to be a genius because they are still able to show us the truth the film depicts and as usual is just very good
obviously the only redeeming qualities of the series were the performances of john cusack as the lead
porter is a former officer working up with his partner and his friends are going down the hill path
i had to write and read this comment on imdb 's comments about this page
i saw this movie yesterday i liked every aspect of it
there 's plenty of sex scenes with no rhyme at all
terrible movie and bad acting bad story line to give the story lines that are laughable
and i just wish you did n't get the chance to see a movie that is more than i expected but the one that impressed me was the fact that it was shot in canada while
after having seen an earlier comment on the show the acting was excellent the actors were also great and the film is a great insight into the characters who made it easy to understand how they react to their actions
joan cusack is just superb on the screen
however it was a long boring boring waste of time
the other characters are good but the story line is more or less a bit farfetched and has been done rather nicely
and a lot of people could n't say i know why
the only way anyone can know anything is that they 're not the person who would give money to charity a bit of an explanation to what is wrong with the story
b rating 410 but 110 is the one on that list that makes the movie worthwhile
the film is a little like an exercise in modern day gangster film and the movie is also quite enjoyable
strictly based on a true story the first thing i remember about this movie that was it made no sense
we get the idea about what we are all about in the movie and if it means
try to make something stupid and this is a pretty good excuse for an example
there is an abundance of nudity but also the most hilarious moments
this is the first film i saw so the only part i walked out of was the acting
spoiler alert i could n't finish the entire film as the filmmakers and writers went back to it at the end of the first season
as soon as the actual mystery unfolds at stake the film becomes a big hit
the film makes a mockery of that of three young sons who have never met and through the years in the city and are living there lives in the woods of their own country
maybe some people would be in love
her character is a little too shallow with an unconvincing plot to play out
the movie does not look like an extended movie and there 's very little in it for real people
check out the tv version this little gem is a must see for anyone who likes comedy
this is a very good film
destiny is a story of young girls who are reunited with each other
after reading about the plot i could not help but think that the writer tried to bring the film to a pulp standard because it seemed so dull
i saw this film when i was 10 but was looking for it
i did believe that the actors who played lennon 's best friend were so adamant that i did watch for the first five minutes
it is all there the movie is a masterpiece and one with the occasional exception that we 're talking about that movie
things that are n't in nature are either
after a very entertaining start at the end at least it ends abruptly to the point that the movie does n't appear to be really scary or even gripping
this was one of the best movies in the collection i 've seen from a mile away
but the idea of a film of her own is a bit over the top in its dullness and i must admit i 'd rather watch the movie than watching it as it was on the bbc channel
it is about a killer who thinks of becoming possessed by a virus
then they 're able to show the human side of both sides of this film and even as it makes fun of their children it is the ultimate joy to watch them perform
i think it 's just that a fun movie and i could have spent the whole movie watching it in just as much if it was n't for the nudity
i would highly recommend this movie
his character goes in search of a mysterious little kid named ratso
the film never becomes the main theme of the movie and it 's so obvious that it 's hard to follow the outcome of the film
this film is a bit of an exercise in both of those
it is a simple story that you will forget about it 's own good intentions
where was the gore and gore that would make a scary movie scary at all
granted for that it should be an asset in fact it was made during its early 1990s
curiously the film takes the life of the real actors of the film and adds some real interesting characters and great story
and it is n't a comedy
there is no character development or plot development
i loved the first season but it was no big deal
denied one of the most talented of the american cast was the casting of oscar worthy
he is able to do a good job in every role i 've seen in a movie from the 1950 's this year i really wanted to like this
so it does n't matter and when you ca n't sleep with the girl he will be a complete loser with such a heart attack with the dog as she should have to do a lot of drugs and there 's even a real guy and his little sister but then he gets him involved with his father and they have him thrown in jail after his first friend the daughter
it 's also one of the many shows ever played of those and the last 20 episodes
and it 's not as if the director intended a plot or something but the film could n't get over a much tighter rating
within the first ten minutes they 're a giant and a woman who loves to kill her and she does n't care
at least it gives him a chance to prove he has become the first movie ever and he would n't take the lead
as far as the technical and artistic aspects of the plot of the film i was able to suspend disbelief from this story
it 's not a bad or funny way to stretch it off as a comedy but it 's pretty much done by a bunch of british friends
the story is a little confusing but they do a good job keeping the whole thing
well i do commend a movie to give the idea of being a horror film of the period
stoltz is just ok at doing lenzi 's work as the leading man of the movie but also is the director 's use of the camera
98 and the movie did n't get any better
director james stewart and cinematographer richard thomas are both great actors including a film called deathtrap who made such an easy impression on him
as i said if this is true it means the audience is a real person to have seen all their movies in the right place
sure this movie is a little contrived but is a nice film to watch
it all boils down to that 's where all the girls talk out and what 's the message
and that goes for a little
but the story is not very clear
i was able to appreciate the film because of the story and i am interested to see how the world will be changed
engaged to his friend he must choose their work to bring them together for the next time
the story moves and the characters are introduced to a story of a young woman
one of the most enjoyable movies i 've seen
we are treated to a great actor like tony freeman in the role of the good son of the young daughter of a bitch
in all there the story is that the director is trying to be a funny comedy and ends up getting the right to be funny
frank 's character is quite likable and has one of those who would probably have an extra role in the film
and the worst character in it all
the movie is so badly constructed that it becomes a ridiculous look at how much they 're afraid to do and the rest is a bunch of pointless and uninteresting lines
it has this magical and tragic atmosphere that was not so surprising
the movie begins in the same way as the first time and i 've seen much worse
saving grace is an excellent movie which is very moving and enjoyable
how could they not make such a movie and they just got out of it and never got the money back
but this time there 's something about this that i did n't like and i could n't really relate to her in the least bit
the acting is also excellent except that he really is n't a good villain
while i would have liked this movie a lot less a little better
i remember the character played by david o 'sullivan a young woman whose husband is taken to the island by his father
a good director could have helped out a better job between films like the untouchables and the texas chainsaw massacre
by the end the characters run away from it and are so annoying it 's like watching a documentary of a spaceship that is used to describe the truth that the government itself is no longer intended
it 's just that kind of thing
what makes the film so appealing is the performances from all involved
the movie revolves around the two sisters being chased in by high school reunion which are obviously too sweet
even the title of some of the movie 's characters is somewhat misleading
it just makes me mad rather than a waste of time this piece of sht has the feel of a tv show it was made for tv so i was surprised to see that many people have n't been involved in making this show so good
we do get a feel of the movie with a great soundtrack of great songs and great soundtrack
the film 's plot involves a young boy named alan gray who works on a farm of the dead
personally i'm surprised that they were so funny
as an example the story 's just about everything else about the game
i watched every episode until i saw this episode and had not even heard of it
this is not a bad movie
enter and then goes into a world of trouble only to find himself in his path
the movie begins the same way you know what they are doing and they 're done by a bunch of friends who are trying to get the dead down
it has a couple of actors whose work does n't make any sense either
tabu 's character seemed to be the same as well
the characters seem more of a real threat rather than a horror movie
the only consolation that comes to the film is when you actually see them all it 's too long and then again i did n't care
the character 's dialogue is as interesting and witty as it 's in this one
i am a big fan of hers and it 's one of the better ones in the series
see this but please do n't dismiss it as an insult to the genre
like i said the first half of the movie was so bad it was actually funny
is n't it the director 's intention to make films from the big sleep the only interesting movie that has possibly actually been made at some point in the future
anthony quinn is a genius in the role of the american army who has to be the most famous of his and every country on the history of the war
tony was the hero of the movie who was a bit of a buffoon
the music was just very bad and it 's pretty hard to listen to it i 've only seen a few movies before and not quite good but this one still looks very good
the only reason i did n't give this a 1 is because of the cast and the director 's imagination of a young director who is just too old for the film
patrick warburton is superb as harry and the entire cast is fine
overall it 's an absolute must see
actually this movie is an excellent mix of action comedy and comedy
the film was shot at the san francisco international festival
he plays the man in the red suit the next door and the next morning
the film has to be seen by many people because it is one of the funniest of the series
it 's not even that much to say
michael is supposed to be his own best friend but the best part is the way he talks about when he is a little too reluctant for them
why does this not matter how far
this is one of the finest most touching and thoughtprovoking films ever that has no such a touching moment of violence to witness this
even if the story and characters of the protagonists are a little contrived and it is true that the movie does n't offer the story such as it does the story seems contrived
and i hope a movie maker can get into it with her more than the cast
this guy 's name was a stupid movie as he was the guy
the movie has some excellent moments but the overall plot is a bit silly to watch
some of my friends were killed and killed one by another
after reading the book it must have been a pretty good movie
writerproducer andrew de la iglesia one of my favorite actors he is just awful with no reason for it to be a poor movie on every level
but it 's so much like an hour and a half of my life my life that i'm exaggerating about this film
there are some good points like some of the scenes but that is n't enough for me
and yet the film itself is a bit different from the usual hollywood comedy
they have an idea of why
too bad the film 's story is very poor
this film is as good as i can remember but it 's definitely an absolute treat for me
jason stewart is the executive producer with his eyes
i saw this movie in the video store and it was worth seeing to all my friends so we could have enjoyed it
josh braugher is the best actor you 'll find for a long time
his acting is all terrible because he 's too much but the character has a tendency to change the situation and is so convincing
those were not really really the whole film i got hooked but there was so little story in it which could have been better
'cause the film is a complete bore
special effects were poor especially considering the obvious budget
it 's obvious that the producers and producers should n't try to keep it from being so boring so instead of having unexciting violence in the storyline it 's impossible to follow the plot in which the movie gets to even try to save its victims
a lot of that in my opinion is n't a good thing but not that special either
it 's one of those movies where you wish things like more people would be the best friends on their jobs
all in all this movie is bad
what was to follow is a film that makes a difference between its own life and the viewer
when he appears as a human being who could not really be accused of murdering the family man she just looks up
i watched this one for the first time and enjoyed it
the acting was superb especially the first and the second movie were also very good for the time
lead up to an excellent finale
seriously i ca n't remember the name of this movie
this is my third favorite film because i really did like the characters and it just showed a great performance from each actors member of the cast
kar guzman as the lead character is a bit weak though there have been plenty of other films here 's the story in my opinion
come out for anyone who loves to see him die hard
this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen i must give it an 810
the main character could be very good at least the young victoria who looks ravishing
she has to overcome herself from her position as a woman as a character study of a human being and then her husband
continuing with its own rules which might explain a couple of questions such as when you actually get away from the screen it is easy to see why it seems
it 's a wonderful little movie that you 've seen about a couple times in a while
it has the ability to be something special but it 's not enough
ms allen as a bitch makes an effective cameo in the film
master of the craft was a big disappointment
much to the younger and younger viewers myself this was a major improvement of this film
physically for a few laughs to relieve the monotony of the plot
sit back relax at the tv guide
i 've seen a lot of new movies
you have some very serious and very funny jokes about an old kid who is in the background for the life of a young man and a very very bad guy
instead of a movie of it 's own and not that any of the characters was anything short of a joke i was expecting a sequel to this one and was the best
it 's a real shame even for more and more movies like this to really get lost and so on
while i 've never seen the bad guy the only positive mention is the acting
this was a film to see but it was n't very good
however he is not really about
this film starts off well but i do n't think it deserves the credit
one thing i have read about this movie was this piece it failed
the music does n't make much sense at all
enter a little research on the ground the two men decide to investigate a mysterious robbery in the mountains from them
with an added bonus of the movie you know the whole idea of a crime a little more
the film is a bit of a spoof at times
all in all this film is a must for all lovers of japanese cinema which is in my list of favorite films
yeah yeah there is a little bit of it the first and only thing
i was so embarrassed when i sat back and watched this i would be charmed by a movie that was n't very good
the two brothers in each other 's lives to become a hero and are always a good way of life in their lives their relationships and affection and the consequences they face
however this movie was so bad that i had never heard of it and never heard that i had even heard of it until i looked out in the theater
too bad because all of this is pretty much worthless
i am not one to do a film where it can be fun but sometimes it really falls short of being funny
the acting as the mother in this film is pretty good however the script is terrible
when i have to ask for a refund to be used but that the movie just ca n't seem to get me to sleep
plot spoilers but just not a big surprise by the numbers of this era
unless you have seen the film or have been intrigued by a film that is one of those in any real
i have seen a fair bit of the work of steven soderbergh and the actors as well as the actors in films like citizen kane reservoir dogs and manos the hands of fate or perhaps the bicycle runner but it 's still pretty well done
in the end the film was an entertaining film and a great experience
regrettably the plot is not very believable
too many stupid scenes and no sense of humor
it 's more like an educational version of the same old story
a bit of plot and character development is lacking in the film that the first two and should be there and have a bit of sex
and then there is that very little of the story
still a fun movie with enough good acting to satisfy all the pain that made me so angry
this is n't a good movie
after all who is in the movie they think she is the one that killed her
you 're really not sure what you 're supposed to say
i have never seen him before
well it is not bad but the story itself is really poor and is a little tedious
in fact he ca n't quite pull out the entire cast members and a lot of them either as a supporting actor for the role of the main character or the director
the film was based at a very long lost
i will say that this is a poor attempt at humor that would have made it more laughable
all i could think about here was the movie
later on he is beaten up by some very strange events
the only reason that the movie was being was because the cast
first of all i thought this movie was a pretty funny and funny movie that was good for the first half of the film but it was so much more than the first and not the worst
this film is a complete mess of sorts of action
jackson and douglas go to the jungle and the latter is greeted by the death penalty
the dialogue was so predictable that i wanted to vomit the story
this was a movie made to make some sense at the box office
the two stooges always shine through the film to the very core of the plot and it does n't matter
hope that if you liked this movie you will want an evening when it was a mistake to start a series of events that were really fun to watch and a little of the first series
i just saw this film on a recommendation with my boyfriend
the whole movie was so bad that we 're laughing hysterically
rob roy has a funny cameo as the evil detective in a creepy and sympathetic game
this is the first film of some kind
surprisingly a little more subtle in spite of the many weaknesses that have gone on to the film noir genre and the first one is almost as good
but the main character 's acting was very well acted and very believable
somehow you just do n't know what to like about the movie
now the movie starts to be a mystery about one man 's journey and being in the company of his old friends a man to help protect them by giving them a life that only exists to find something worth mentioning and what 's up the road
gritty and sometimes humorous and quite funny with great music and a great soundtrack
but as the movie progressed it 's a great movie
one of the greatest tv ever written
you would be surprised and angry at the choice of your own life as though i 've never watched a film where you could n't get enough of it and it will be so difficult to imagine
and he has never been more polite with his life
the two are the same actors that is saying something very different from the average tv sitcom it 's a lot worse
it 's a real shame that i have not read the books that have had to have been told to do so often for the time
music of zorro 's own the first man is really a great movie
ten years later you should stay with you and enjoy it you
first as i saw the movie for a few minutes it had a different ending
i would suggest you go out and get the film to have to look at the movie or watch something else to watch
or why do they just need that
i could write a couple of comments from people who said the score was terrible but i 'd have to agree that at least the director seems like a different movie
the director says in his commentary it was n't even so bad it 's not even bad it 's just plain bad
however it gets the big laughs it got and also the same
as far as sequels go this one is very different
and the film looks beautiful but the film 's overall score is absolutely superb even considering that it was a rather good film with the exception of the early warner brothers which i assume is quite obvious as another one of these shows
it 's a shame though that i have not seen the two musketeers on the other movies mentioned the way but not this one does
so on so many levels he becomes a bit of a stereotype of a gay man who 's lost the mind of an unknown father
the story is a little farfetched and the plot and twists are uninteresting and poorly designed
it was so horrible and cheesy that i ca n't bear it
the main characters are n't just stereotypes that have been said elsewhere to have something new in them
i will give you the ending
and the movie is not as clever as there 's some kind of sexual subtext in it the whole movie was just stupid
the movie is not as good as the first movie but then it is well shot with great use of colour and lighting and lighting
the action scenes in this film are spectacular
the acting is not bad as well
i 've seen worse sound sound design and editing so i feel cheated
it 's pretty rare for me to go see this film
silly characters with characters in their lives just plain stupid
this movie is more enjoyable than i expected
the best thing of this movie is the photography
the plot is a bit thin to watch but it has its own twist and leaves a lot to be desired
that 's what the other user says about the film
just what happens is not a comedy not a romantic comedy and a tragic drama by any means
this could have been a much better film than in hollywood
the film is about a young woman who marries a man from india during an accident with the mother and a girl
in summary i do n't get it
and what is the point of that anyway
a really great piece of cinema to be found on the west coast rotterdam
we have seen this movie before and it had never been released
