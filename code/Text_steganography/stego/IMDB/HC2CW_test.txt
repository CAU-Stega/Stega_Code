it 's a shame because the film is so boring that i ca only think of one good thing
the movie was shot in a very tight way and the actors were all pretty bad
it is not a movie that you can see
in the end it 's a good film to see if it 's on the air or something
this is the first film that i have seen in my entire lifetime that i can honestly say i was very disappointed in the first half of the film and it was n't that bad either but i was n't expecting much from it
perhaps it was the fact i was n't watching it
it 's a shame because the movie was n't so much better
this is a very bad film
some of them are just as good
the film has a very interesting plot and the characters are very believable and believable and the characters are likable and the story is a little weak
this is the first film i have seen that made me cry
regardless of this the film is not a comedy or a drama
one thing i liked about the film was the music and the costumes
a lot of people have said this is a good film but i think it 's not that bad
the movie is a complete waste
which i thought it was a very enjoyable film
director michael winner is the master and the director is a genius
i was surprised to find that this movie was a waste of time and money and time and time again and i have to admit i did n't have to watch it to see if i could get the original or the director
funnily the movie is a complete mess
set in a remote town in new jersey city and a small town in new york city of new zealand new jersey is in a place of a new york apartment in the city of chicago
ewan arquette is a great actress
it 's a very good film and it is a great film
it is a very funny film
it 's a very good film and a great movie to watch for all
sam waterston plays a very good role in this film
this movie is not a good movie
it 's not even the best of the series
only the most ardent fan would have been a fan of the original series and had the opportunity of being a little more faithful to the original series
i have to admit that the movie is a little slow at first
if you want to watch a film that is so good you should see this one
there is a lot to be said but i think it is the best movie i 've seen
claudia is a very good actress and she 's a great actress
something like this happened in the movie
caan 's performance is the only thing that saves the movie from getting shorty and the ending is so predictable
and it 's not a good film either it 's a good film
it 's not even a good movie
he 's not the best character in the movie but he 's not a good guy he is just a bad guy who gets his ass kicked by the guy who 's not even a bad guy
or the fact it 's a comedy or is it just an excuse for a laugh
7 the story of the movie is about a group of young people trying their luck
if you 're a fan of the original series you 'll enjoy the show as well
movies are n't funny and the actors do not have the ability to make a good movie but the script is so awful that it makes you wonder how many times you have seen the first one
the movie was shot on location and the camera work is very good and the acting was excellent
they are not even funny and they 're not even good enough to be funny and they are not funny
gradually he meets a young man who has been diagnosed by the devil
it is a very funny movie and i recommend it
julie is the one who is in the film and she 's not a very nice person she is a woman who has no idea what to say
snoop dogg is a good choice to play a character
this movie was so bad it 's good i mean the acting is horrible the story is bad the special fx are bad the story line was bad and the acting is horrible and the plot was so stupid that it could have been so bad
the film has some good points but the story line is n't as good
in fact the film was shot in a small budget and the acting is pretty good
update is the best movie ever
this movie is not a bad movie but it 's not a bad movie it 's just a bad movie
the film has a very good cast and it 's not a good movie
i was surprised that the film was n't released in theaters
perhaps it was the director of the film
except for the fact the movie is a little bit too long it is a very good movie
i'm a big big admirer and i have to say i love this film and it is a must watch
sorry to be honest i did n't like this film
isabelle huppert is the perfect actress for the part of the movie
obviously this is the first film that i have ever walked out on and it is not even the easiest to watch it to the very least end of it
half of this film was filmed in the same location
the film has a very good story and the actors and the actors are great and the movie is a perfect blend between the old west
but it 's not the worst film i 've seen
we are supposed to be a bit more forgiving about the characters but we are not supposed for a story
you know what i was talking about but this is the only movie that has ever been made
the movie was a bit slow but it was a good film
donnie darko was a great movie
if i were to give this a 1 rating it would have been a 0 for me
i was n't impressed by the fact that it was made for television and it was a bit too long for the film to be released in theaters and the movie is a bit too short for a movie
the film has some good points but the story is so weak that it becomes a bore
if you 're looking to be scared by a movie that 's not bad it is n't
prim and very very very funny and very very very very funny and funny and a good laugh at the end
anyway i was surprised that the movie did n't get released theatrically in theaters and the only thing i liked was that the film was n't a total waste of time
expertly photographed by the great cinematographer wolfgang petersen who also directed the movie
i was surprised that this film did not get a wider release
kudos to the director and crew
this is a very good movie and it 's not just a movie
frantic to see a movie like the first one
i have seen this movie several times
i'm a fan and i have seen the movie
however the film is a little slow at first
they 're all in a very good place and the movie is a bit over
how can a film like this get made and released by a wide margin in the uk and the industry
2 the acting is terrible and the plot line is so bad it 's almost impossible for anyone who likes to laugh
the film has a very good cast and it 's not a bad movie but the acting and direction is very poor
this is the first film that has a good story and a great story line
he 's a very talented actor and a good guy
kids are n't even the best of this movie
it is a shame that this movie is n't available on video or dvd
there are a few good moments but the rest is a little slow
back then it 's not even that good it is n't even that bad it is just bad
the movie is about a group of young men who are trying to find their way home
it 's a shame because it 's not a bad movie but it 's a great film
of course the movie has some of its moments but the story is so predictable and so boring it 's hard to follow the plot
it is a very funny film and it 's not a bad film
for the first half hour i thought it was a pretty good movie
do not watch this movie if your a diehard fan
i have seen this film twice
when i first saw the movie i thought it was going as well
all the characters are likable and the story is very interesting and interesting
you can see the director 's intent to create a movie with the right amount
the film is about the struggle of the two men to the extent that the film is not about the relationship between the two men
finally the movie is about a young man who is a little bit of an accident
i was surprised that the film did n't get released in theaters and it was n't released in the uk
in the end it is a great film to watch and i recommend it
having said that i have to say that this is one of the worst movies ever
i was n't impressed by this film but it 's a good movie to see if it 's on tv or dvd
but the film 's main flaw was that it had a few good moments and a good story line
now that i 've seen the movie i can only assume the movie was made in a very low budget
the film has some of its most memorable moments but it is not a movie
so the movie is a bit of an insult
one of the best films of all time
much of it is the acting and the direction of the film
at least the movie was a little too long
a few of them were very funny and i thought they had some good acting but the movie just did n't make up for the lack
but the movie is not a good one either as it 's not as good as the original but still a good movie
no matter what the movie is supposed to do with a few scenes of violence and nudity the film is n't even worth mentioning that it 's a horror movie and it is not
i have seen this movie twice and it is a great movie to watch and enjoy
please please do n't watch this movie
be prepared to see the movie
tyrone bergman is the best of all
this is the first film i have seen that i have ever walked out on
john goodman 's character was a bit too old for the role
some people have said that the film is so good that i have to admit that i have seen the movie and i have to agree that it was a very good film
but the film 's main problem is the lack of any real plot and character
if i had n't seen the original i would have given it an extra
in the first film the main characters were a bunch of people who have no idea what they are doing and the story is so predictable
3 the movie is about a group that has a very good story and the acting was great
anyone who has seen the original film knows that the movie is a remake of the original book and it is not a faithful adaptation of a book by the author
in the first movie he is a very talented character actor who is a real person and is a real treat
she 's a little too much of an idiot
the film is a complete waste
the movie is about a group of young people who are trying their best
i was surprised to see that the movie was made in the early 1990s and it was n't even that bad either but it was not a bad film
the film has a very good cast
i'm a big big admirer and i have to say i was a little surprised at how bad this film is but it 's not that bad either it is a waste of time and time and time and money
i have to admit i did n't like the film
or maybe it 's the fact that it 's a little bit of a shame that the film is n't as good as the first one
just as the film is about the same subject matter and the exact story of the characters
so the movie was a bit of a disappointment but i was surprised that it did not end
of course the film is n't a total disaster
as a result the film has a lot to offer and is a bit too much to bear
and it is not the worst film i have seen
stress is the best of the series and the best
they 're all very good and the movie is very good
if i had n't seen the original version i 'd probably have seen the original
ok i know it 's a good thing
better luck to watch this movie
the film is a bit slow and the story is too thin
termed as a comedy and a comedy it 's a little bit too serious for the younger crowd
people who are not familiar to the original story will find this movie to be a bit boring
the movie was a waste for the movie
a lot more of the film is a bit of an exercise in a long time
do n't waste time with the film
some of them are just plain stupid
that is the only thing that i can think about
the film is about the same subject as the first film
nobody seems to have a clue about the story or plot or character
for a movie that was supposed to be about a woman 's death she is a very human being and she is a woman who is not a very good woman but a woman who is not a woman and is not a good woman
most people are not interested in the story but it is still very entertaining and very funny
the movie was a waste of time and i would n't recommend it to anyone
there are a lot more of the characters and the story is a bit contrived
i have to say that this movie is a waste
various of the characters are so stupid and the story lines are just plain stupid
i have seen this film twice and it is a great film to see
this movie is a complete waste
outstanding acting by the leads and the supporting cast
the movie is a bit of an insult to the viewer but the film is very entertaining
we have a lot more to do with the plot than this
although i do n't know what to do in this movie i have n't read the novel
i was surprised to find that this was the worst film ever made and it was n't a bad film but it is a good movie to see
similarly the movie is not about the war and the political implications that are presented
dick powell plays a very likable and likable man who is trying to get a job in a small city
yet the film is a little slow and the ending is a bit unsatisfying
i have to admit i did n't enjoy this movie but i did n't think it would be a bad idea
i have to admit that i was very disappointed
while i do not think the film was a complete waste for me i would have given this movie a zero
and the ending was a bit abrupt and the ending was just plain awful and i do not know what to do with this movie but it 's not that good either
overall the movie was pretty bad and i would have given this movie zero but i did n't
when the film is released it is not only the funniest of the genre
he 's not the only actor in this film that 's a little bit of a stretch for him
regrettably it 's a little too long
marsha kudrow is the perfect choice to play a woman who is a little more interesting
and the movie was so boring that it could n't even get a 2
i have to admit that i was n't impressed by the film but it 's a good film to watch and enjoy
with the help from his friend the local police officer the police chief and his wife and the two men who have to deal to get the job together and the two leads are all very good and believable and the film is very entertaining and the acting was good
i was n't impressed by this film but i did not expect much from the film it was a very good movie and i liked it
the film has a lot of action and a few scenes that are very well choreographed but the film 's overall impact of the movie is a little too long
the film has a lot of potential to make it a little bit of an achievement but the story is so bad that you can actually see it
by the end of this film you will be wondering what 's the point of the film
so the film has a lot to offer and is n't a good film
if i had n't seen the movie it would be a little more enjoyable to see the film
what is the deal with this movie and what it 's about the story
on the plus the movie has a lot of action and a good story line
but the film 's biggest problem with this movie is the lack of a story and it 's not a good one
such a film is a rare example of how to do something
i was surprised that this film did n't have to rely on the fact that it is not a movie
or maybe it 's the same thing that i did n't like about the film but i think that the movie was a bit of a letdown and i think it 's a bit of a bore
sally kellerman was the best actress in the movie and she was very good in the movie
even the most ardent of characters in the film are not the same
some of them were so stupid that they could n't have made a better movie
he 's a great director and he has done a great work
two men who are married to a woman and a young woman who have a onenight life
just as a movie is about a young woman named seita and her son who is trying too hard to be too hard to cope with the fact they are not being stalked by a mysterious woman
its not even that good and it 's a bit too slow for a horror movie but it 's not
maybe the director should be ashamed of himself for making a film about the holocaust and how it affects the world of war and the consequences of war
what a waste for a film
3 out of 5 stars for the acting
it 's a shame that this film has n't made any sense to me and it 's not a good movie to begin to watch it
they 're all in the same place
that 's the only thing that makes it worth seeing for a few laughs
this movie was so awful that it was almost unbearable to watch
not only is it not funny it is a comedy and it 's not funny
this is a very good movie
the movie is about the power and the struggle of a man to get his wife back to life
i have to admit that the movie was a bit too slow and the ending is a little too abrupt and too predictable for the viewer
maria 's father is the only person who is able in the world of the film and the two of them are very different from their counterparts
unfortunately it is n't the same
i have to admit i did not enjoy this film but it is one that is worth seeing for its portrayal
the movie is about the power and soul of a young woman who is not afraid of her own
director michael winner has a very small budget and a sense that the film is n't a masterpiece but it is a good film
amazing movie about a man and a girl
but the film 's main problem with this film was the fact it 's not a good movie
while i was n't expecting much of a film it 's still a very enjoyable movie
by the end of the movie i was n't sure whether to be scared or just plain bored
there are a lot of things to criticize here but it is a very enjoyable film and a great one at it
the film has a very good cast and the story line is very good and the acting was great and the story line was very good and the characters were very likable and believable and the acting was great
monty python 's the first one was a good movie
it 's not a movie that you will enjoy
the movie is about the same subject as a book
hopefully it will be a good film
not to say the movie is n't a total mess but it is still a good movie
unfortunately it 's a little bit of a stretch for the audience to find out what happened to the characters and their motives
then there 's the fact it 's a movie about a bunch of people who are trapped in the middle
this movie is not for the squeamish
the film has a very interesting story line and the characters are very believable and the characters are all very likable
followed by a series that was n't even nominated for a academy award
are they going to make a sequel
it 's a very good film
every scene in this film is so funny that you can see it in the theater and the movie is n't even worth the time to watch it again
we have to see the movie for the first time
i was surprised to find that this movie is a little too long
an excellent film with a very good cast and a very nice cast
the film is a complete mess of the first film
quite possibly one thing that i have n't seen before
the movie was shot on a low budget and the acting was n't bad
in fact the only reason i gave it 2 stars was that the acting was so good that i could not believe that this movie was made
but the movie was a bit too long
i was surprised that this movie did not have a theatrical dvd
lost highway was a very low production and it 's a shame because it 's a pretty good movie and i recommend this movie
it 's not a movie that you can watch and you will enjoy the film
aileen is the best character of all
it 's a shame that the film has been released in dvd so i can see the movie as an example
there is no reason to see this movie
i was n't expecting a movie about a man and his wife who were in love and were told to go to the country to find a place for their lives and their lives and their lives
then there 's a few things that are so bad they are good and the movie is just a waste of your time and time to watch
they are not even funny and the story line is so bad that you ca n't even tell if it 's the script or the direction or the direction
young people who have been living in a city and are living in a city of ember and have been living for their lives
and the ending was a little too abrupt and too contrived to be a thriller
during a brief interview between two men and a man who is supposed and disappears at the end he 's not even close to the truth
are we to believe that the film is a satire
i have to say i did n't enjoy the movie
it is a very good movie and it 's not a good movie to be honest
so the movie was made for the first half hour
ron howard is a great actor
after a while the film is a bit too much for a movie
it 's a shame that this movie is not available on video or vhs release or vhs
yeah i do n't know what to do
maybe the director was trying too much to make it look good
and the movie was a complete waste of time and money
in fact the film is a bit too slow and the ending is a little unsatisfying but the ending is so predictable and so predictable that i could n't help thinking it was going to be a complete waste
so the film is not a bad film
it is a very good movie and i think that the actors are all excellent
the movie is a bit slow but the acting is superb
and the movie is a complete mess
how can a movie be so good that it is not
pitch high school plays a very straight and straight role in this film
look at the cast and crew
it 's a very good film and a good example for the film
in the first movie the characters are not developed in the least bit
the movie is about the power of the characters
the film has some good points but the rest of the film is a complete mess
the movie is a complete mess of the first film and it is n't even that good
he 's not the only one who has to be the most irritating character to be seen
i have to say i did not like the movie but it was very good and i loved it
i have to say that i have seen this movie twice
it 's a shame because the film is a little too long
story is about a group of people trying to find their own way
even the most diehard of them are not even close to being the worst
i was surprised that this film was made
she is the one to do
the movie is about a group that has a different outlook on life
a lot more of a good movie than this
if i were to give it a chance i 'd give it a 0 out of ten i give it 0 out 10
unfortunately the movie is not as bad
she 's a very talented woman and a good actress but her performance is not very good
this movie is not for the squeamish but for the rest
i was n't expecting a lot of the film to get excited but i did n't expect much from the film
this is the worst movie i have seen in my life and it is not a good film to me
there is a scene where a man is stabbed in a car accident and the scene is shot in a very light manner
i have to admit that the film was very good and the actors are very well done
the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash in at a time in which the story was made and the ending was just too stupid to make it even mildly enjoyable to sit through and the ending was just too stupid
if you 're looking to be scared by a film like the first one you will like this one as it is not a bad movie but a great one and a good movie
this is a movie for those who like the genre
the movie is about the same thing as a typical slasher flick
will the director please please do not watch it for yourself
we are supposed to be a little more tolerant and we do not have a lot to do
just like the other two movies
this is the first film that has been released in the us
after a while the film is about as much fun to watch
rent it if you want to watch it and watch it again
now i know that i am a big fan and have n't seen the movie yet
if i were to rate it a zero i would
it is a shame because the movie is so good
i was n't expecting much of this film to be a good movie but it 's not a bad film
soon after a long shot in a crowded car accident the film settles on a very slow and boring note that is n't even remotely exciting or exciting
which is why the movie is so bad
all the characters are likable and the story line was great
where the hell did the director 's cut of this film come from
i was n't impressed with this movie but it was a great movie and it 's not a bad movie
alas the film 's only saving graces is that it is not available in the us and the director is not a fan
it is a shame that this movie is not available in dvd or vhs
i have seen the movie twice
the movie was a bit of an attempt to capitalize upon the success of the book but the film is not as good as it could have
add to the mix of a couple 's characters and the characters are all very interesting
but the film 's main problem is the script
the film has some good moments but it 's not enough
now i have seen a lot worse
all in the family and the movie is not a good movie but it 's a good one to see
not only is it a bad film but it 's a good movie to watch
and the movie was a bit of a mess but the ending is so predictable that i could not believe that i had seen it
after the first half of the film the audience gets a sense that the film is not going to end up as the first one
not to mention that it 's a very good film
i have to admit i did n't enjoy this movie
basically it is not a bad film
i was surprised that the film was n't so much more of a thriller
since i was a kid this movie was so bad that i was laughing hysterically at the tv and the jokes
the movie is a complete mess of the first movie
in fact the only thing that makes this movie watchable are the scenes with the girls
this movie was so bad it was funny to me because of the fact that it was made for the sake
this movie is not a good movie but a good movie
there are some very good moments in the movie but the film does not work at all
this is the first film i have ever seen
opportunity for a movie that was n't made in a theater or a box office
i have to say i did n't like this film
the film is about the struggle between the two and a new wave of the events that happened in a different way
like i said it 's not the best movie ever but i have seen it all
richard widmark plays a very good guy and he is a good guy
is it the best of all the shorts that are made in this country and it 's a very good one
it is not a film that will be remembered for its rerelease
being a fan of the series and having watched the series i was very excited that the series had n't lasted longer
the film has a lot to do but the film does n't have much to offer it
there are some good scenes and some good acting
spent the night with the girl
being the first of a series to be the first of three movies the series is a very different film and it is n't
cutie is the only person who is able to make the movie
overall the film is a little too slow and the ending too abrupt
it 's not even the best movie ever
those who are n't in this film are the same as the ones that are the ones that have been made in hollywood
and it is not a good film
the film has a very interesting story line
other reviewers here have said this movie was so awful that it made it to be one
there are some very good moments and some good ones but the movie does n't have a lot to offer and the ending is just plain stupid
this movie is not a bad movie but a very good one at its finest
this movie was so awful that i could n't even finish watching the movie
i have seen this movie twice and i still remember the first one i was laughing at the screen and i did not like the movie i was expecting it
in fact it is a very poor movie
there is no real reason to see this film unless you are looking for something more than a waste
though it 's a little bit dated and a little dated at times i found myself wondering if it would have been more interesting if the characters had been developed
they are all very good actors
maybe the director should have been a bigger star but he 's not a good actor and he is not the best actor
this movie was a complete disappointment to me and the acting is horrible and i do n't care what the director is saying
but it is a great film and i recommend this movie to all
first off the movie is a bit slow and boring
as a result of the film 's popularity the movie has been released in the us
unless you are looking for a movie that is a bit slow at times and you have to watch the film to find the right place for a movie
i was n't expecting a movie to get a grip on me but this one is a complete waste of my time and i do not recommend it
one thing i did n't like was that the film did n't get any better than it did in this film
jude law plays the part with the character of the first one and the second one was very funny but i think he is the only actor that i liked
hand of the eye is a film that will be forgotten for many years
of course there is a scene where a man who is supposed to be in a mental hospital is killed and the girl who has been killed is a man who has been killed
despite being the most controversial film i 've ever watched this one has a very strong plot
i'm a fan of this film and i have seen it several times
as a result the film is a complete mess
people who are n't interested with this film should be ashamed of themselves for being able to make a movie that is not a complete failure
a few of them were good but the story was so bad it was n't funny at all
i have seen this movie twice
i have seen this film twice
even though it is a bit of a parody it is still very good
i have seen this film twice
i have seen this film several times
aside from the fact it is a film about the evils of the war the movie is about a group of people that have a different plan and they do n't want to be in a position to be a part
i was surprised to find that the film was not as bad
the movie was a waste of my life and i could n't wait to watch it again and again and again and again
eg the film has some of the worst acting ever assembled in the film but it is n't
as a matter the movie was made in a very short period of time
it is a shame that the movie is not as bad as it should be
as a result the movie has no real plot
sometimes the movie has a lot of action and it is a bit of a stretch to watch it but it 's not
throw the cast out to the big bad guys and you have the recipe for a good film that will make you think
i was n't impressed with the film
brosnan is a great actress and i hope that the director will continue to get a lot more credit for the film
for the most part the acting is pretty bad and the plot is pretty weak and the acting was horrible but the acting was good
not only does it have to have a few scenes but the film is a complete mess
you know what to do with the story and the characters
at the end of the movie the audience is treated to a bunch of people and the film 's main protagonist is the hero
he is a great actor and a great actress
hayworth 's character was a little too old for her own
the movie was a bit slow but i did n't think that it was really good or bad enough
i was surprised to see that the movie is a little too much for me to enjoy
all in the family and their friends
even though it 's not a good movie it 's still a very enjoyable movie
he is the most talented character of the film and his character has a lot of charisma
alessandro is a very good character
to be fair the movie was a waste of time
of all the films i 've seen i have to say that i have n't read the novel but i do n't think it 's a good film to watch and it is a very good movie to see if not the best
i was n't impressed by this movie
why did they make such a movie about a man
for the most of the time the film was shot in the early seventies and was shot on location
rhythmic and very moving and very funny
one thing that really annoyed me is the way the movie was shot
at least the film was n't a complete waste of time and i would have given this a 2
it is a very funny film and it 's not a good film
red buttons and a lot of the same old footage
their relationship with each of them is so much more believable
do not watch it for yourself and you 'll be disappointed
next time you see this film you will be disappointed
the film is about a group of people and the other one
we are supposed to believe that he 's a good guy and he 's a good actor but it is not a good film to begin with
unusual spoilers the movie has some nice twists and some interesting twists but the movie does not make any real impact and the story is so weak that it becomes almost impossible for them to get involved
however i was n't expecting a lot of this film
the movie is a complete waste
no matter what you do n't want to see it you 'll be disappointed
i have to say that i was very impressed with this movie and i really enjoyed it and it was a great movie to see
they are not even close enough to be a good movie
the film has some good points but the rest is just a dull mess
but the film is a bit too long
she 's not a bad actress but her acting skills were very good
she 's a very good actress
i was surprised that this film was made in the early 80 's and the first one is a little dated
this is a very bad movie
i have seen the original movie
you can tell the director is n't trying too much to make a good movie but this is not one of those
there are some very good scenes in this movie
the movie is about a group that has been kidnapped and tortured by the death of a woman
i was n't impressed by the movie but i was n't disappointed
while i do not think the film was a good one it is a very enjoyable movie and i recommend this to all
peter o'toole is the only actor who can play the role of the villain and the film is a little bit too long
evidently this movie is not a good one but it 's a good one
this movie was so bad that it made me laugh
friendship is the key to the movie
through the whole film i was wondering why the movie is so awful
i have seen the movie and i can safely say it is one that i would love to watch again
in fact the film is a bit too slow and the story is too predictable to be believable
the movie was a waste for me
the movie was shot on a budget that would have made the film a little better
a few years ago the film was made and the story is about the same thing
indeed the movie has a lot of potential
or the fact that the film was made for a few years
nothing is ever done in this movie and it is n't a bad thing that it 's not even a movie
i was n't impressed with the film
contains spoilers i have a feeling that this is a movie for kids who have not read it
but the film 's main problem with the movie was the fact that the film was shot in a very cheap way
lacking in a sense of the story and the characters are not developed in the slightest
the film has a very interesting plot and the characters are all likable and the characters are likable
i have to say that i was n't impressed by this movie
three of the most memorable scenes in this movie involve a young man who is in the hospital and a young man in the woods
none the more it 's not that bad but it is n't
it 's not even the worst of the series but the acting is n't too bad
what a great film this was and i hope it gets more attention to it 's release
victor mclaglen is a great actor but he does n't seem to have any range in the film he 's not even a very good one either
there are some very funny moments in the film
this is a movie for those interested with the subject of the movie and it is a good film to watch
i was surprised to find out the film is a complete waste of time and money
it is not a film that is not for the faint hearted
when the film was released the film screened on a dvd release of the film
too many of the characters were so bad they could have made it a little better
i'm not a fan of this type but it 's not that bad
laurence olivier plays the role of a young woman in the movie
from the opening scene of a young man walking through a window of a building of a woman 's body to a man 's face and a scene of a man 's body being torn off by the man who 's been crucified in the bed of his comrades in the film 's final scene of the film 's initial denouement the scene in which the film is shot in a very light and beautifully lit manner is a delight to watch and the film 's climax of the movie is quite poignant and beautifully scored by a very young man who has a very difficult time with his own life
it 's not a movie for the masses or the faint of heart but it 's not a good movie
it 's not even a good movie
the film is about the same thing about a woman who has been murdered and murdered by a woman who has been killed
cast members who are n't in this film are the best actors i have ever seen
repeat of course is the story of a man who has been living with a woman in a small village
the film is a complete waste
one of the best movies ever
this is a movie that is n't even worth renting
the movie is about a group of young people who have a relationship together and they have a relationship with each others
film noir was a great movie
this is a very bad film and i would have given this film zero
the movie was shot on location in a very small town
my advice is to watch it and enjoy it
sometimes the movie is n't a good one
for a film that is a little bit of a mess it is a film that will appeal to anyone with a heart and heart
the film is a complete mess of a film that is n't worth watching
yes the movie was a bit slow and the ending was predictable but i did n't expect it
the film is a complete mess
it is not the best movie ever made
we are not supposed to be scared
still it is n't a bad movie but it is a great film and i recommend you watch it to find out
the film has some of its moments that make you laugh
will the viewer be able to identify with this movie and the story is very well written
i have to say i was very impressed with this film and i was impressed by it
that 's the way i should
this movie is not for the squeamish
i have seen this film several times
after the first half hour i was hooked and i had to leave the theater
i was n't impressed by this movie
proceed to get a little more attention from this film than it was in the first place and the film is n't as good
i have seen this film several years ago
but the movie was n't so much a lot of it was just a bunch of people talking to the camera
spoilers ahead i have to admit that i have n't read the book
the film is about a group that is attacked by the devil and the two of them are killed by a werewolf
a few years ago the movie was made in the early 80 's
he 's not the best character in the film but he is a good guy
unlike the other films this is one of those
more importantly the movie has some good points
please do not waste your time watching it unless you 're looking to watch a movie with a bunch that is n't
it 's a shame that this film has n't made any sense to the director 's reputation and the film is not even worth the time of the film to make
the movie was a bit slow but it was a good movie and i would n't recommend it to anyone
well the movie was a bit of a mess
scandalous and interesting to see a film like the one that has a few good scenes
darned to the point where i was n't able to watch the whole movie
keeping it from getting a 1 out 10
ving rhames is a great director and i hope that his next film will be more enjoyable than his other films like this one and the ones that are so bad that he is n't even close
as a result of the fact that it is a movie that has a lot of potential it is a great movie to see
oh and the ending is a bit of a disappointment
the movie is a complete mess of the first movie and the second is the most annoying one i 've seen in a while
barbara stanwyck is a woman in the middle of the depression
when i saw this film on tv i thought it would be good but i did n't have the time of watching this movie
it is not the worst movie ever but i 've seen it all
whether it 's the script or the acting it 's a very poor movie with a very poor cast and a very bad plot line
it is a very funny film and it is not just a comedy
the movie is about the same thing as a child
this movie was so bad it was funny to me because it 's so bad it 's good it 's just plain awful and i ca n't even remember how it was supposed for a sequel to the first movie
the movie is about a young woman who has a boyfriend and a woman
the movie is a bit of an action movie but the acting and the acting are all good
visually the movie was very well made and i think the actors are all excellent
as for the acting i think that the director was a bit prejudiced at the time and the fact of the matter is that the movie was shot in a time warp in which the film is set
i have seen the original version and it is a great film to watch
the film has some of the most memorable moments of a film
were we to assume the director 's intention was that the audience would n't have to have the slightest clue of what the film was about and the outcome was so obvious
with a supposed budget the best thing i can give it is the acting
the movie was shot on location and it 's a very nice film
it 's not even a good movie but it is a good movie
was it supposed to make me feel that the movie is going to end
it 's a very good film and it 's a shame because it 's not a good movie but it 's a great movie to see and enjoy
but it 's a good thing
the film is a bit of a mess
the film is a bit slow and boring
the film has a very good story and the actors are good
the film has a very interesting story and a good cast
amelia 's character is a bit too shallow but the story itself was so good that it could n't be further more entertaining and interesting
pretty much all of the characters are likable and it is easy for me to understand the plot and characters
i have seen the movie twice
the movie was a bit slow but it did n't make sense to the viewer to watch it
in the end it is not a movie that is n't even remotely funny
some of them are just as bad
when the movie was released i thought that the movie was going to end
it 's a shame that the film has n't been remastered in the us
warren beatty is the only one who can be blamed on his own
i was surprised to find out that the film is not a comedy but a very good one
this movie was so awful it 's funny
i was n't expecting a movie to get the message across the board
with the exception being a good film the acting is pretty bad
he 's a very talented director
it 's not even a good movie but a very funny one at that and it is n't even funny
it is a very good movie
when i first saw this movie on the shelf it was the first movie i saw in the theater and i was impressed by it
let me tell you this movie is a waste of time
take the time and place to see this film and enjoy the film and you will enjoy it
i was surprised to find out that the movie is not about the same subject as the original but it 's a good one
i have to say that i was very disappointed
when the film is over and the actors are all over and they 're not even funny it 's just not worth the effort
this is the worst film i 've ever seen
as a matter the film is a complete mess
the movie is about the same subject matter as a child 's play and a love triangle
what is the point in this film
the movie is a bit of an insult to the viewer but the story line and the acting are all good
but it 's not a good movie
anyway the film is a little slow but the acting and direction is so good it 's hard to believe that this was a movie
hot women and a lot of fun
if you 're looking for something that 's a little more interesting then this is the movie for you but if you are a fan you 'll probably enjoy it
the movie was shot on location and it was filmed on a budget that was filmed on a cheap budget and it looks like a student made a video game
the movie is about a young woman who is attracted to a woman who is in her own home
some of them are not funny
if i had n't seen the movie it was n't
this movie is not for the squeamish but it 's worth seeing for its visual style and the performances of all
the film has some good moments but it is not
i'm not a big fan of movies like the ones i saw in the theater
it 's a very funny movie and it is n't a bad film
none the more i think it 's the worst movie i have seen
david cronenberg is the director and the film is a great deal to watch and is a must watch for all ages and a must for anyone interested in a movie that has been done in the past
the movie is a complete waste of time and a waste of money and time
there are some good moments but it is n't
for the most of us this is a great film for the entire family to enjoy and appreciate and it 's a great movie to see
ten years ago the movie is a little slow but the acting is superb
i have to admit that the film was very good and the actors are very well done and the actors are great
by the time the film was over the film seemed to be a bit of a letdown
i have to say i was n't impressed by this film
in fact it is a great movie to see if you can find a good movie
the film is about the same thing about the man and the girl
my favorite scene was when he is in the car
from the beginning of this film i was a bit confused by the end of this film
in fact it 's a very bad movie
con man is one that you should watch and you 'll enjoy it more than you did
perhaps it was the director 's intention to get a few bucks out of it but the director did not have to worry that the film is a total mess of the first movie
so i was expecting something like this
sergio martino is the master of the genre
georgio is a very good actor
and it is not the best film of all times but it 's still a good film
but the film 's main flaw was that the film is not as bad
it 's not even a good film
and the movie was a complete mess of a film that is not worth the time to view it on dvd
trust it for the fact it 's not even a good film
luckily it is a film that will not be forgotten
the film has a lot to offer and is a great film to see and it is a must see
that 's what i got from the film and i did not like the movie
twin peaks was one of those movies where the story is so simple that you ca n't help thinking it is going nowhere
so i was n't expecting much from the movie but it was a great film
the film is a complete waste
herzog 's film has been released on dvd and the film has been edited by the director and the critics who have seen it in the theatres
to be honest i did n't think that this movie would have been a good movie
cartoons like the lion king or even manos hard target
terrible movie that was n't made in a hurry to make a movie
he is a very talented actor
i was n't impressed by the fact it 's not a comedy but it is a good film
we are supposed for a movie that is a bit too long and boring
educating a man with his hands on a horse
chamberlain 's performance is the best of the three
the film is a bit of an action film but it is a good film
throughout the film i was a little skeptical about it and i was n't impressed
although the film is a bit slow at first i found it very slow and boring and i was left feeling like i was in for a good time
everything about this film was bad and i could not believe it was made
this is the first film i have ever walked across
i have seen the movie and it 's not a bad movie
i have to admit i did not enjoy the movie but it was a bit too slow and too slow
but the movie was n't bad
this movie was a waste of my time
much like the movie the plot was very predictable
i have to admit i did n't like this movie but it is one of my favorite movies of all times
further the movie has a lot of action
balls and shoulders are the best of the three films
just as a movie is about the evils of war
also i do not know what the point of the movie is
his character is so unlikable and the acting is horrible and he is n't funny
he 's a very good guy and he is a great villain
on a technical level the film was a waste
if you 're looking to be a fan and you have a yen to watch this film you 'll be disappointed
the film is a complete waste
they are all very good and the movie has a lot of good points
we are supposed to be a bit of an observer of our own lives but the film is not as bad
i was surprised to find that the film was not as bad
petersen 's character is a bit of a caricature of the character
he is a very talented director and a great director
this is the worst movie i have seen
later the film is set up to be a little too much to be a comedy
ok i have to admit that the movie was pretty bad
on a positive side the acting was pretty good and i liked it
some people say it 's the worst film i 've seen
i have seen the movie and it is one of the most beautiful films ever made
because the film was so good and the actors were so bad that it made it hard for them to get into the pants
first of all i have no idea what the director was trying for
later on he meets up again and again and the rest is a little more tolerable than his later ollie 's
just like the other reviewer said it was a great film and i would recommend this film
having said that the film is very well made and has a great cast and it is a very enjoyable movie to see and enjoy and enjoy and it is a great movie to watch with your buddies and friends and friends and family
soon the film is set up to be an allout horror film
i have seen this movie several years and it is one of my favorites and it 's one that will appeal to anyone with an open mind and those who love the genre and the movie will be a great deal to see it
benjamin is the only person that has a shred of respect and is a bit of an actor
i have to say i was very impressed with the movie and the way it was made
he 's not the best character in this film
not only is it not funny it 's not funny it 's just plain stupid and the jokes were lame and it was funny
there are some good scenes in the movie but the film does n't work
or maybe the fact that it was made for tv
she is the one to blame for the fact that the movie has a lot to do with the fact that it 's not a good film
it 's not even a movie
the film is about a group of young men who are in the middle and spend a weekend together in the woods
unfortunately the movie is not as bad as it is
here is a film that is so bad that it is hard to believe it is a movie or a drama
that 's what i got from this film
so i was expecting a good movie
also the movie was a little too slow and boring for the first half
but the film 's biggest flaw is the lack that the director has developed
the movie is about the power of a young man who has been a struggling father for his family and the life of his father and his son
he is the only one to die and he 's not the one to blame
as a matter the movie is a bit too slow
great acting and a great story
you know that the film has been made in the us
i was surprised that the film was made
this movie was a complete disappointment to watch and it 's not a bad movie
but it is a good movie
they 're not the only ones who have a good sense to them and the story is so predictable
i have seen the movie and i have to admit i did not like the film
elliot is the best actor ever
with a supposed beard in his head he is a little stiff
the film has some good moments and some good acting but it 's just not enough to save this turkey from being a total waste of my life
she is the only one who has a chance to get rid and she 's a little more than a bit of a wimp but a good actress and she is very good in this film and the movie has some good points but it is n't
slim and his friends are the only two people in this movie
reverts to the original the movie is a very good film
in the end it 's a good movie to see if you 're looking to watch a movie with a few twists and turns
in fact it is not a movie that you will enjoy but you 'll be glad you 're in for it to come out of your head
and the ending is a bit abrupt
i was n't expecting much from the movie
the movie is about the same thing as the first one
it 's not a movie that you will see but it is a great movie
macfadyen is a fine actress but the rest is just plain awful
dr hackenstein has been sent to a prison to assassinate a group called dr who who is a former scientist
mostly it 's not even the slightest bit of the movie 's plot
the movie is about the same subject as a movie
it is a very funny film and it 's not just a movie it is a very funny film
i have to say that i have seen this movie several years and it still has me laughing
but the film 's biggest problem with this movie is the lack that it 's a very poor film
i have seen the original version of this movie and i can honestly say it was one of the best i have seen in years and i have to admit i did n't enjoy the film
from the beginning of the movie i thought it would be a great movie but it was n't that bad
btw the movie was n't so much a little more than an hour and twenty minutes of my time
of course the movie has some good points
the film has a very good cast
this movie is a complete waste
i was n't impressed by this movie but it 's a good movie to watch and enjoy and it is a great movie to watch
but the film 's main flaw was the lack that it 's a good film and the director should have had a lot of fun
the film is a bit of an action movie but the action sequences were so good that i could n't even get through it and the movie was just so bad that i could not even finish it anymore and i was n't bored at all the way it was filmed and it was just a bunch
he is the most annoying person i have seen
whats the only thing i can say
i have to say i did n't like this film but i did not like it
we are supposed for a film to be a bit slow but it 's a bit too slow
i have seen the original version of this movie
does n't it sound so bad it is good
they 're all very good and have some great actors
it 's not even a movie
some people say that this movie is bad
i have to admit i was n't impressed by this film
unlike the other two movies this is one of the worst
wide awake is a film that is a must see for anyone interested with the genre
after a few years of hearing a lot of things about the film i thought that it was going nowhere
praise is the only reason i gave this movie a 2
he 's not the only one who is a bit too much to bear
she is a very good actress and i think she is a very talented actress
if you 're looking for something to laugh about and enjoy watching the film then you 'll be able
of all the movies that i have watched this one i would have liked it to have a good story line and a good cast but i do n't know what to do with this film and i have to say i was n't disappointed
but the movie is not a complete disaster
actually the movie was a bit too slow and the ending was too predictable
no matter how many years later he is still a good actor and a very funny actor and he is very good as a man
killer is the only one that has to be one of those
the film is about the struggle of a man to a man who is not afraid to be a man
the movie is a bit slow and the ending was just too predictable to make me want to watch the whole movie and i was bored to tears and the ending is just plain awful and i was left wondering if the ending was just too stupid to be funny and it was just a waste
well i do not think that this movie was a good movie
i was n't impressed with this movie
yeah it 's a little too long
what is the point of the movie
andre braugher is a great director
for a movie about the holocaust it 's a good thing to see it in a theater and not a movie
the film is about a young man named kenny played by a man named luis who is in the same age of the same age
which is a pity because it is a very bad movie
that 's the only thing that i did not like
the film has a very good cast and it 's a shame that the film is n't available in the us for a few years
he is the most talented actor in the world
i have seen the movie and i have seen the movie twice and it is a very enjoyable movie to watch
cheri is the one who has to do with her own
there are some good scenes and some very funny scenes but the film is not a complete waste
as a matter of view i have to say i was very impressed with the movie
in the first film the characters are all very likable and the characters in the movie were so likable and so believable
the movie was shot on location and it was filmed on a low angle budget
strike the movie as a comedy and a comedy
for a film that was a little bit too much for me
certainly a film that will be remembered as one that will be forgotten by anyone with an interest in history and history
the film is a bit of a bore but it is a good film to watch
it is a shame that the movie is not as bad as the first
i was n't expecting much of this movie to be a horror film but it was n't that bad either it was just bad
from a very good opening sequence of the film to the end of the movie i could have done without the flow of it all
dressler 's performance is a little too much
i have seen the original version of the scarlet pimpernel and i have to say that it was a little too long for me
the film has some good moments and some good acting
altogether it is a very good movie
avoid this one at any cost
do n't waste time with the movie
the film has some of its moments that make it hard for the viewer
ok so i do n't know why
it is not a film that is n't even a good movie but it 's not
very few films have been made
there are some good scenes and the movie has a lot to offer but the movie does n't really work
one thing i did like was that it had the same plot as the first movie and it 's a shame that the movie did n't have a lot of action and the ending is just as bad
in fact it 's a shame that this movie is n't available on video
it is a shame that this film has been released on dvd so that it will be available on dvd
more importantly it 's not even the worst of it
along with the other actors in this film i was expecting a good film to watch and i would recommend it
the film has some good moments and some good performances
with the exception being a good film the story was pretty good
again the film is a complete mess
i have to say i was very disappointed with the movie and the acting was n't too bad
if i were n't for the first time id would have to be the one to get it out of the hands of a young woman who is a bit more than a little anal
she 's a little more than she bargained for
i have to say i was n't impressed by the film
this movie is a must for all fans
my favorite part of the film was the ending
since the movie is about a woman who has a daughter who is n't really a good person she 's not a good person
the movie was shot in the same way as a child
grant is the best in this movie
the movie is a bit of an insult
is it the best of the bunch
some of them are just as good
the film has a lot to offer and is n't a complete waste
at the end of the film i felt that i had been watching a film that was a little bit too long
music is a little choppy and the story is n't as bad
at least the movie was a bit too much for me
the movie was a bit of a letdown
the movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence of the audience
i was surprised to see this film
those who have seen the movie will know that the film is a little slow but the story line is very good and it is very entertaining to watch and the acting is superb
the movie is a complete mess
the film has a very interesting story and the acting is excellent
and it is not a good film to be honest it 's a good movie to see if it is n't for the fact it 's not a movie
you can tell that this is the first movie that i 've seen that is n't even remotely funny
just like a movie that was made in a hurry
first of all the acting is horrible
i was n't expecting a movie about a group that is n't going to be a good guy
sean penn plays the role of a young woman who has to deal to find out who is the killer
walter brennan is the perfect choice to play the role
they are not the only ones that have a shred to do with their own
indeed it is not the best movie ever
there is no reason for this movie to have been made in a time
the film is a bit of a mess but the story itself is very good and the acting is superb and it is very good to watch
while the movie was a bit slow at times it was still very entertaining
i'm a big big fan and this is one of the best movies ever
where the film fails is that it 's a little too long for the audience
really the movie was a lot better
i have seen this film twice
the film is a complete mess of the original film
the film is a complete mess of a film
so i guess it 's a movie about a man who is a man who has been a loner for his life and is now in a coma with his friends
but it 's not the best movie ever made
but it is not the best of it 's genre
this is the first movie that i have ever seen
i was n't impressed by the fact that the film was made for tv and it was n't a complete waste
but it 's a good movie
for the first half of the movie the audience is left with a sense of the plot
and it is not a movie that you will see
i have to say i did not enjoy the movie
the film is about a group that has a very different outlook of the lives and problems that are being made in their lives and how their lives can be dealt
i have seen the movie twice and it 's a shame that the movie is not available in dvd
this movie was so bad that i was laughing hysterically at the screen
there is no reason to watch it and it is n't even worth mentioning that it 's not even a good film it 's just plain awful and the worst thing is the acting and directing and directing and directing and editing is terrible
this movie was a waste for the first two hours
marie dressler plays the mother who is a bit of a jerk
consider it the worst of the worst
yet it 's not a bad movie
gradually the film begins to get weirder
and it is a very funny film
custody of the killer is a film about a young woman named sosuke and her mother
it is not the best film i have ever seen
the film is about a young man who has a son who is a little bit too infatuated with his mother and son
why did n't they make a sequel to this one
randy quaid is a good actor but he does not seem like a good actor
the movie was a bit of an action film
the film is a complete mess
i'm not sure why this film was so bad but it 's not
the film has a very interesting story and a good story
cheese is a movie that i would recommend to anyone who likes to laugh at the genre and enjoy it for what it 's a good movie and a great movie
one thing i did n't know was that the film is set in a very large mansion where the movie was made
it 's not even the worst movie i have seen
i was surprised that this film was made in the first place and i think it was the best movie ever
also the film has some very funny scenes
there is no reason to see this movie
i have to say that i was very impressed by the film
to me it was the worst movie ever made
either the director or director of this movie should be ashamed of himself
i have seen the original movie and it is a great movie
the film is a complete mess of a movie
i have to admit that i was n't disappointed by the movie but i was n't disappointed by it and it 's not even worth mentioning
mr blandings has a very small role as a young man who is trying to find a way out
as a result of the film it is not as bad
this is the first film i 've seen that is as good as it gets
instead it is an insult to all the actors that are involved with this film and they are not even worth mentioning that it is a film about the holocaust
released on video in a small town and the other two are now available on dvd
the movie was a waste of my life
wholesome and very very very funny and i think that it is a great film to see
in fact it 's not a bad film but the acting and direction are all excellent
george clooney plays the part of a young man in a very strict way and he 's a bit too young to play the role
maybe it was the fact i was n't watching it
this movie was a complete disappointment
and it is a very good film and a great one
maybe the movie is n't that good but it is n't that bad
this movie was so bad it 's funny
i was surprised to find out that the film is not about the same thing
also i think the director was trying too much too hard
there are a lot more to the film than this movie
tyler 's father and son are a little too much to ask for themselves
i was n't expecting much of this film
clint eastwood 's performance was the best of all
the film is a bit of a bore
a lot of the film is about the characters and the characters are so realistic that you can feel sympathy for the characters and care about them
he 's a very talented actor
i was n't expecting a movie to get a grip but the movie is so good
campfire stories are not as good and the bad guys were bad but this one is just awful and the worst of all the bad guys
for the most part the acting is superb and the story is a little weak
his performance is so bad it 's laughable
i have to admit i did not enjoy this film but i was n't disappointed by the fact that the film was a bit too long for the first two
i have to say that this movie is one that is not worth watching for any serious reason
there are a lot of good things about this movie
yet the film has a lot of problems and the story is very weak and the characters do not seem to care
who would n't be able to make this movie a little better
the film has some good moments but it 's just not worth it
the movie is about the same subject matter as the first one
like i mentioned above the film was a bit too long
the movie is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by her father
thought it would be good to have the movie on a shelf with a friend
i have to say that i have seen this movie several years ago
i have to admit that the film was very good and i would n't have to watch the movie to see if i can get the chance to see it again
the movie is about the power and soul of a young man in the world of the late 1960s and early 30s and his early forties
the movie is a bit slow and the story line is very predictable and predictable
i was surprised that this movie was n't released in the uk and released in theaters
it is a very funny film
yet the film is a bit slow and boring at times
the film has some good points but the story is so weak and the acting is just awful and it is n't funny at least
it is a very funny film and it is not just for kids but for adults and children alike
although the movie was n't as good it was a good film
this is the first film that has been released in a long time
the movie is a complete waste
ps the movie is a bit slow but it is n't a bad movie it 's just bad and the worst of all the worst movies i 've seen in a while and it is n't funny at least not that bad
the movie was a waste for me and i was surprised that it was made in a time when the film was released theatrically
well i guess i 'll be watching the movie
they 're all very good and have some good points to them
the film has a lot of action in the movie and it 's a bit of an action movie
it 's a very good movie and i would recommend this film to anyone
if i were n't for a good movie it was n't
the movie was shot in the same location as a handheld camcorder and it was n't even the case with it 's predecessor
now that 's the point of this movie and it 's not a good thing
the film has a lot to offer but the story is n't too good
the film is a complete waste
shannen doherty is the perfect choice to play the role of a young girl who is attracted to a woman
seems like a bad idea for a film
i was surprised to find that the film is not a comedy
the movie is a complete mess
unfortunately it 's a little bit too long for the viewer to enjoy
so i guess i 'll just say it was n't a bad film
this is a very bad movie and i do not recommend this film
i was surprised that this movie was n't released theatrically
yes the film is n't a complete waste but the acting is superb
while i do n't think that this movie is a good film it 's a good film to see if it 's not for the fact that the film is a little bit too long for the first half
in the first movie the characters were not developed in the least
they 're not even funny and they are just plain stupid and not funny at least not funny
it 's a shame that this film is not available in the us as well as it 's not
perhaps the most memorable scene is when a woman gets her comeuppance in the first half of the film
now that i have n't read a book that i would like to read the books i have to say i have read a lot about the story and i think it is the most important aspect in the film and it 's not a very good film
i was surprised that the movie was made in the first place and the director did n't seem to have a lot to say
he is a very good character actor and a very funny actor
seriously i do n't think i have seen this film
they 're not even funny and the film does n't even have the same exact impact as it is in the first one
if you want a movie that does not need a lot of humor to make it a little bit of fun to see then you 'll enjoy it
after a while the movie is a little slow but the acting is superb
this is a very good movie and it 's not a bad film it is a very good film
after the movie was released the movie became a big success
a few years later i saw the film on tv
i was surprised that the film did n't get released theatrically
all in the name is a very funny and funny film
it 's a shame that this film has not received any oscars
i was surprised to find out that the film is not a complete disaster but i do n't know why
it 's a very funny film and it is n't even that funny to me
i'm not sure why i did not see the movie but it was a good movie
but the movie was n't bad enough
i was n't expecting a lot from the film but i was n't disappointed with it and i did not care about the plot
it is a very funny film and a great one
however i was surprised to see that this was a very low production and not for everyone who would have been a little less surprised if they were in the movie business
it 's a very funny movie and i think it is a very good film
the film is about a young man who is a struggling woman and a woman
quinn 's character was a bit too unlikable to have been a caricature
anakin 's father and son have been sent to prison for a murder
the film is about a young woman who has a boyfriend and a daughter who has a daughter and daughter
however the movie is not as bad as the original but the acting was good and the story line was good enough to make me laugh out loud
this is the worst movie i have ever had to sit down and laugh
for the first time i was n't sure whether this was a comedy or an attempt to cash into the plot but it 's not
visual style is the best thing in this film and the film has some nice shots of the city
bettany is the best actor in this film and it 's not that he 's not a bad actor but it 's a great movie
by the time the film was over the movie seemed like a bad idea to be a movie about a bunch
bela is the only one who is a bit more than a caricature of a man who has no idea of what he is
they are not the only people who are not in love with the movie
it 's a shame that this film is not only available in the uk
he is the only one to die
that is the only thing that makes this movie worth watching
the movie was shot on a low budget and the actors were all pretty bad
all the characters were so stupid that i was laughing at them and the whole thing was so stupid that i could not care less
as for the acting i would have given this a 0
after the movie i thought i 'd be watching the movie and i would n't have been able
gunga din 's performance was excellent and i was surprised to see him in a role
any of the other actors are a good actor and i think that the actors are all very good
the film is about a group of young men who are married and have been married
the film has some good moments but the story is so weak that it 's hard for the audience
we are supposed to be rooting for him and the other characters are so stupid that they are n't funny
it is a shame that this movie has been released theatrically on dvd
this is the first film that i 've ever seen that has been made in the past decade and i have seen many of the other films
as for the rest of the movie it 's not that great
cynthia gibb is a great actor and i hope she does it again in this film and she is very good in the part
still it is a good movie
we have to see it to be a little more interesting to watch it
now i have seen a few of these movies
the film has a very interesting plot and the characters are all very believable and the characters are all very likable
sequels are not the best of the series
the film is about a group of young men who have been living in a small village
and the ending is so stupid and stupid that it 's hard to imagine how it could possibly end
they are not the only people who have seen this film and they 're all very good and i have to say i was n't impressed
i have seen the movie and it 's a great movie to watch
i have to say that i have seen a few of the films that are so good that i have to say that this is the worst movie i 've ever had the misfortune of seeing and i have n't even heard about it
i was surprised that this movie was n't released in theaters
i was surprised that the movie did not get a wider release in the us and the people who made this film had to be in the mood to see this movie
the movie is a bit of a bore
attraction to the original is the most interesting and most important thing to come from the film 's success and it 's not even the best of the three
beethoven 's character was a bit of an idiot but the story was very good
the film has a very good cast and the actors and actresses are excellent and i have seen a few of them in my lifetime
i'm not sure why i was n't impressed with this film
yet the movie is a bit slow and the story line was n't as good
it is a shame that this film is not only a film for the fans but also because of the fact it is a film that is a little too much for a younger crowd
it 's a shame because it is not a movie
notice the fact of the matter that this is the first movie i 've seen in a long time
but the movie was a bit too long
you know that it 's not a bad film but it is a good film
but it 's not the worst movie ever
her character was so stupid and the acting is so bad
i have seen the original movie
i have to say that i have n't seen the movie yet but i have seen it twice
it is not the best movie ever made
ronny hardison plays the role as a cop
when the film is released i have a hard time finding out how it got going
they are not the only ones who have a shred of respect for the story and the characters are so real
now i know that i am a fan of this film
at least the movie is a little bit of a mess
a few years ago i was able to see this movie
richard widmark is a great director
it is not the worst film ever made but it is still a great movie to see
this is the first film that has been released theatrically in a year
this is a movie for everyone
an interesting premise for the film is that the director has a lot of fun making a film about a young man who is trying too hard
you can see the director 's intentions and it is not a bad thing to see
i have to admit i did n't like the film but i was very impressed
the movie was a waste of my life
a few years ago i was able to find a movie to watch
at least it 's a bit of a stretch to watch
i was surprised that the film did n't get released theatrically in the us
i was n't expecting a movie about the evils that were being made but i was n't expecting a good story and i did not like the movie because of the way it was shot and how the movie ended and the end result was a little slow
and the ending was a little unsatisfying and the ending is a bit unsatisfying but i do think that it is a great movie
what is the point in the movie that is the most important thing in the film and it is not a movie that you can see
i have seen this movie several times and i still love it
a lot of people are talking about this film and it 's a shame that it was made
the film is about a group of people and the other people in a small village in which the world is inhabited
the film has some good points and is a good example
but it 's not a good film
kicked out by a few of the other reviews
the movie is about the power of the characters and their relationships
this movie was so awful that it made it to be one of my favorite movies of the 90 's and i was n't even a big movie fan of it 's genre but i still enjoyed it and i still enjoy it more
i have seen the movie twice
now that 's the only reason why i give it a 1 out of 10
since the movie is a bit of a bore it 's not even that bad it is just plain awful
silly and boring and the movie has no redeeming features
she 's a very talented woman and she is very convincing
it is not a movie that is so bad it 's good it is n't even bad
a few years later i saw this movie on the sundance film festival and it was one that i would love to watch
then there is a scene where a man who has been a victim of a crime and has a mental breakdown and a woman is a little bit too reluctant to handle
however i do n't know why i did n't watch this movie because i had to see it for free
a lot of people are talking about this film and it 's not a bad movie but it is not a good film either as it is not a bad movie
while i was not impressed by the film i found myself wondering what the point was
when the movie was released it was a very good movie and it is a very enjoyable film
this is the worst film i 've seen in years
or the fact that the movie was shot on location in the first film is a real treat to me
a lot of the film is about a young woman named caroline who has been in a mental hospital and is now a teenager and her mother
the movie is about a group that is attacked and tortured
this movie was a complete waste of my time
the film is about a young woman named becky played with her father by a young woman named lila
young people are n't always in their 20s
i have to say that i have n't read a lot of the other comments here and it 's not the best film i 've ever had the pleasure to see
if you want to watch something like this i recommend you watch it and you 'll be hooked
it is a shame because the movie was a bit slow and boring
it 's not a movie for everyone but if it is a comedy you 'll probably be laughing at it
the movie is about the power of a man who has a son who is a man who has a gift for his life and is not afraid of the consequences he has endured
two men who have a secret encounter with the same woman who is a bit more interesting than the one in this film
he 's not a good guy but he 's not a good guy he is just as bad
i have seen this movie twice and i still have to admit that i have n't seen it since i was in a coma and it scared my mind
kind of a movie that is n't a good one
he is a very good actor
because of the fact that the movie is about the same subject matter it 's a movie about the life of the young girl who has a heart attack and is so much better than she is
and it 's not a good movie to begin to watch it
anthony quinn plays a very likable and very likable man who has to be a ruthless man
in fact it 's a very good movie and it is not a bad film
this movie was so awful that it made me angry and angry at how bad this movie was
this movie is a must see
anyone with an ounce of respect in their life will find this film boring and not worth the time to watch
i have seen this movie twice
the movie is a complete mess
if i were n't for a good time this would be the one to watch and it 's a shame that it 's not available on video
this is a very bad film and i do n't know what it was about
i have seen the original movie
it is a very good film and i would definitely like to know how to make a movie that has a great cast
he 's a great director and a great actor
i have to say i did not like this film but i was n't expecting much
jenny is a very beautiful woman who has been in love for her husband 's life
there are a lot of good things to be done here but this movie is just plain bad
heard the title song and the song of a song by a man who is n't a teenager
to me it was a great film and it 's a great film to see
he is a very good character actor
shot on location and the editing of this film is a bit choppy and choppy
once again the film 's main flaw was the fact that it was a complete flop
it is a very good movie and i recommend this movie
lauren graham plays a woman who has to be a woman to get married
from the opening sequence of the movie the viewer realizes that it is not a good idea
that is what i thought it would be a good idea for a film
a few years later i saw the film and i thought it was a great movie
this is a movie for those interested with a lot of fun and a lot more fun than the first one and the first half hour
as for me it was n't that great
frank sinatra is a fine director
recommended for those who enjoy a movie about the holocaust and how to deal
it 's a very good film
there is a scene in which the two men are talking to each other and the women are in love with the other
you know that the film is going to end
one thing that i found most irritating was the fact the movie was shot on a low level of a camera
i have seen the movie and i have seen the movie twice and it 's still very funny and i think that it is the best movie i have seen in a long long long long long time and it is a joy to see
one of my favorites was the first one
however i was n't expecting much from it but it 's a great film to see
actually the movie was a little slow and the plot is n't very interesting and it 's not a good idea to begin to get involved
it 's not a bad film but it 's a great movie to see if you 're looking for something to watch
she 's a little too old to play a character but she does n't seem very convincing and she does not have a lot to do
after the movie was over i was n't expecting anything else
the movie was shot in a very small budget
please do n't waste your time on this movie
check it out for the fact that it is a very enjoyable movie and a great movie to watch
meanwhile the film 's director and writer are trying to make the audience feel sympathy towards each other
the movie is about the power of a man and his life
this is the worst film ever made
however i was n't expecting a good movie
however i was n't impressed with the film and the film is not as bad as the first one
instead of being a little more than the usual suspects of a man who is a little too infatuated with the idea that he is a little more than he bargained for the truth is revealed in the end
it is not the best movie ever made but it is still a good movie
like the first film the acting was pretty bad and i was expecting something like the original
having said that i do n't know what to say about it
this is the worst movie i 've seen
the movie is about a young man who is a teenager and is now a member
the movie is about a young man who has been kidnapped by a woman in a small apartment
so i was n't impressed by this movie
i have seen the movie and i can say it 's not a bad film but i think that the film was made in a very good manner and it was a very good movie
there is a scene in which a man is stabbed in a car accident and then the scene where he is walking through a table
mr bean is a great director
anybody interested with this film should be advised to watch the movie
it is a very funny film
for a movie about the holocaust of the holocaust the film is a very interesting and very entertaining film that is a real treat
there are a few good moments but the rest is just a dull mess of a film that is not even worth watching
tierney is the best thing about the film and it is a very enjoyable movie
given the fact that the film is set up in the same location as the original the movie has the feel of the first film and the second one was very good
i was surprised that this film did not have the same plot
loads and a lot more than a few of them are in the film and the movie does n't have a lot of action
reactions are the only reason why this movie is so good
we have to be careful to see this film as it 's a little bit too long for me
i have seen the movie and i can safely tell you that it is not a movie
as for me it 's not that bad but it 's not
where the film is concerned is the fact that it is not a comedy it 's a drama and it 's not even funny it 's not funny
this is a very bad movie
this is the first film i have ever seen
were they trying to make it a success to the audience
marvelously directed by the director of the film the story of a man in the woods who is sent into a world war ii by a group that has been sent by a local police officer and his gang to find out who is responsible for their crimes
timothy dalton is the only one who has a knack for the role
it 's not even the best movie ever made but it is a great movie to watch and i hope it will be on dvd soon soon
he 's a very talented actor and a good guy
aside from that the movie was a complete waste
for the first time i saw the film and was amazed by the acting
i was surprised that the movie did not have a lot of action
at the same moment i thought that it would have been better to be more entertaining and more interesting to watch and i was n't bored with the story
this movie was a complete waste of my time and i do n't know why
they are all in a very different form of their own
it 's a very good film
i was n't impressed with this movie
it is not the worst movie i 've seen but i have to admit i was n't disappointed by the film
clara is the one who is a very beautiful woman
it 's a shame that this film is not available in dvd
it 's a shame that this film is n't available in dvd format
i have to admit i was very impressed by this film
the movie is a complete waste
this is a very good film
the film is about the struggle of the two men to the extent of their lives
the movie was shot in the same location and the same actors in the same location and the actors were n't in the film
not only does it have a good story line it is a good movie
in fact the film is not a total waste
linkin street has been released on video for the last few years and i still remember it fondly
so i guess it was n't the case with this film but i think it was the best
it is not the worst movie i 've seen but i have to admit i was n't disappointed by this movie and i did not even get to know the rest
so the film is not as bad as the first but it 's still a good film and i would recommend it
the film is about the same subject matter as the original and the original
by the end i could n't help but wonder if this is a good movie or not
did n't you know that the film is going nowhere
yes the movie is n't a complete mess but it 's a good movie
this is the worst movie i have ever had the displeasure of watching
but it is not a movie
however i was surprised to find that the film is not a comedy
yes it is not the worst movie ever but i have to say it was one of the best
well i do not think this movie is worth watching
this movie is not a good movie but a good movie to watch
talbot is a great actor but the film does n't have much to do with the plot
at the end the film is a bit slow but the ending was very good and the story was very good
shame on the director for giving the film an extra dimension
where the hell did they come
yet the movie is not a comedy it is a comedy
in the first film the characters were not believable
i have seen this movie several times
overall the film is a little too slow for the first hour
i was surprised to see this movie
in the first film the characters are all very different and they are not just a bunch of people who are not in the same room
the movie is about the same thing as the first one
i have seen this movie several years ago
you can tell that the director was a director of a film
payperview was the first movie i had ever heard of
then there 's the fact that it is n't the same as in the first film but it 's not
this is the first film i have ever seen in my life
black and white cinematography and cinematography are very good
if you 're looking for something to laugh at in the end then you should be a little more careful to appreciate the film
could n't they have done it
nostalgic and very very funny and the acting is great
a lot of the film is about a man named sam who is a man and his son who is in love
they are not the only ones that have a good sense to them
this movie is not for everyone
let 's face it the movie has no real point
fans of the series should see it
the film has a very good cast and the story is a little too thin for the audience
but it 's not a good movie and the actors do n't seem to be able to act in their roles
however the film is not a complete disaster it 's a very boring film
halloween ii was a very entertaining movie and it 's a shame because it is one of my favorite movies of the year and it is a shame that it has been released on video for a week or so
soon after a few years of hearing the noise of the dead body of the dead man 's body the film begins to be the same as it 's the first one
caught the eye on the cover and i thought the movie would be good but it is not a movie
it 's not even the best of all
since i was in a small state of the world i was in my late twenties and i had to endure it for a while
see this film and enjoy it for what it 's worth and it is worth a watch if you are looking to see a good movie
the movie is about a group of young men in the same neighborhood
john wayne 's performance as the villain is a bit too pat
and the ending is a little too abrupt
this is the first film i 've seen that i 've seen in my life
a lot more of the same
the film has some good points and some of them have a good plot but it 's not a good movie and it 's not a bad movie
its a shame because the movie was n't so bad
compared with the first film the film is a very good one
oh and the ending is so bad that it makes the movie a little too long for the rest
the film is about a group of people and their lives in the woods and the lives of the people in the town
there are a few moments of brilliance in this film that are not only funny but also funny and funny
what a great film this is and i have seen it countless many times and still have a great laugh
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen in my life
i have to say i did not like the film
directed by a man who is a fan of the original film this film was a complete disappointment and i would have given it a zero
the film has some good moments but the rest is a little too slow
parents are not the only ones that are not corrupted and are not in their teens 's way of life
not only is it not funny but the acting and the direction are very good and the story line is great
why did they make such an awful movie
very few films are available on dvd
gable 's character was so bad that it was hard to believe he was ever given the role
especially when you 're in the middle east
why did n't they just use a few words
it is a shame because it is not the worst film ever made
one thing i did like about this film is that the characters are not developed in any depth
after a few minutes of the movie the film is about a bunch of young people who have a very difficult time together
but the movie was a little too long for me to enjoy
hanna linney is a delight as the mother of a woman
the film has a lot to offer and the story is very interesting and interesting and it 's not the same as the first
that is what i think of this movie
the film is a bit of a bore
the movie was a bit of an attempt to capitalize upon the success of a book
alongside the first film the acting is superb and the script is a bit of an improvement on a young woman who 's a bit of an actress in the past and a bit too young for her own
this movie is not for the squeamish
not only does it have to be the most expensive movie ever but the acting and direction are so good it is almost painful
there is no real reason to watch it
i was surprised that this film was made in a hurry
i have to say i did n't like this film but it was a great movie and it was a great movie
as a result the film is a complete waste
it is a very good movie
it is not the best film ever but the acting is superb and the direction by robert de niro and his excellent collaborator robert duvall is superb
and the movie was a complete mess
this is a movie for everyone
gordon is the only person that has a shred of decency and is not only a very good person but a good man
aliens and the martians have a very small part in the film but they are n't really the same as they did
oh and a few of the actors who are in the movie
and the ending was so stupid
i was n't impressed with this film but i was n't expecting a lot
but the movie was a little too long for the first two
i have to say i was n't impressed by this movie but i was surprised that it did n't get released in theaters
i was surprised to see this movie in the us
the movie was shot on location and the camera angles are very poor
i was surprised to find out that this movie is not a comedy
it is not a film for the masses or for those interested in a film
with a few twists and turns that are not to say the least
she 's a very talented actress
first off i was a bit disappointed
however the film 's main flaw is that the story is n't a complete mess and the acting was terrible
scifi is the best of all the movies
he 's not a bad actor but a very good one and he is a good actor
it 's a shame because it is not the worst film ever made but it is still a good movie
this is a very good movie
after a few minutes of watching the movie i was n't sure if the director intended to be the next clouseau or something
if i had to watch it again i would have to say that i was n't impressed
i was surprised to see this movie in the us and i was n't impressed by the film
the film has some good moments and the acting is pretty good
then there is the fact it is a movie that has been done so many years before
after a while i was n't sure what was going on
in fact the only reason i gave it a 1 is that it is not for the faint hearted and the movie is not as bad
both the story and characters are very believable
it 's a shame because the film is so bad it is almost laughable to watch and the only thing i can think of that is the worst thing about this film
i was surprised that this film did n't get a wider audience award nomination for the film
thank you for allowing me to see it
you know what i was going through
my advice is that if your a true fan and a fan you will be disappointed by the movie 's plot
the movie is a complete mess
surely the film 's only saving graces are the acting
it is not the best movie i have seen but i have to say that it is one of my favorites of the year
the film is a bit slow and the story is too predictable to be believable but the acting is superb and the direction is very good and it is a very nice movie
too bad the movie is so bad
i have to say i did not like this movie but it is a good film to see and i recommend you to watch the whole movie and enjoy it
sherilyn fenn 's performance as the mother is a little bit too much
instead of a movie that is n't funny it is a complete waste of time and money
this is a movie for everyone who loves a good movie
yeah it 's a little bit too long
no one has to endure this film
the film has a very good cast and the story is a little confusing but it 's not a bad film it 's just a bad movie
i have to say i was very impressed with the acting
this movie is not for the squeamish but it 's worth watching for all
anyway i was n't expecting a movie to be so boring but this was a good movie and i really enjoyed it
one of the best films of the last century and the most successful one
the movie was a bit of a mess but i did n't think it was a bad movie but it was a fun ride to the end
however i was n't expecting a lot of the movie to get the plot
framing of the movie was the first movie i saw in the theater and i was impressed by the fact it was made in a very low quality
in the end the movie has a lot of action and it 's not even a comedy but a very funny one
the movie was shot in the same way that it did not have to be the best movie to be made in my life and it was so bad it 's good i just saw the trailer for this film and it was so bad it was funny
it is a shame that this film has n't been available in the uk
filmed in a small budget and a few scenes the film is very good
this movie was a waste of time
the movie was shot on location in the early seventies
not to mention the fact of the matter of this movie
it 's a shame that the film is n't so bad as the first one but the acting was n't bad
too bad it 's a shame that this movie has n't made any money
however the film 's biggest problem with the film was that it had no plot and the only good parts were when the main character was in the movie and he did n't really care
well i guess it was n't a bad movie
a few of the scenes are very good and the acting was good but i was surprised that the film did not have the same impact as the first one and i think it was a little bit of an attempt to cash into the movie
we have to be careful to be the only person who can relate to this movie
as a matter of fact i was n't impressed by this film
now that i 've seen the movie i can say i have to say that i was n't impressed with this film
i have seen the original movie
it is not the worst film ever made
you can tell that this is the first film that has a lot of potential to work with and it 's a shame because the story was pretty decent and the acting is pretty decent but the story line is so bad that i ca n't believe that it was made in a time that was so bad it was good to watch and i really enjoyed it and it 's a great film to see
this movie was a waste for me
but the movie was n't bad enough
i have seen the original movie
for a movie about a young man who has been in the business for a long time
the movie was a bit slow and the ending was predictable but it 's not a good movie either
this movie is not for everyone but it is a great movie to see and you 'll be glad to see it again
while the movie is a little bit slow moving the plot has a lot of holes
this movie was so bad that it was funny
so the film is not as bad but it is not
every scene in this film is so funny and so funny that it makes you laugh and cry at the screen
more than anything else it 's not a bad movie but it is a great film and i hope that the director will get a chance to see this film
my advice to anyone interested in this movie
this movie is not for everyone but it is a great film
the film has some of the worst dialogue i 've seen
out there the movie has a lot of action and some of the scenes where the hero 's character is killed and killed
but the film 's main flaw was the lack of any of the actors and the script was so bad that it was almost impossible for the audience
carell is the best actor ever in a movie and it is a pity he did n't get nominated for his oscar nomination for this movie
the movie is about a young woman named caroline played with her younger brother by the great aunt
with the exception being the first movie the acting was good
sure it 's a bit slow and it is n't a good movie but the story line is very good and it is very well done
this is a movie that i can watch again
the film has some of its moments that are not funny
alex 's character is so stupid that it becomes annoying
way back then it was a movie about the holocaust and the struggle between the characters and their interactions
the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash in at the very beginning of the movie but it 's not
daniel auteuil is a fine actor and he is a joy as a man who has a very good time with his wife
we have a very good movie about a young man named angus who has a crush on his son and his son who has been living for a long while
to be honest the movie was n't so bad
had the director been a fan and the actors were so much more convincing than they could be
the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash into a book but it failed to deliver any real purpose
while the movie was n't a good movie it was a bit of a bore
and it is a very good movie to see if you are a fan
one of my favorites was the fact the director wanted us with a lot of action
she 's a little too old for her role
the film is about the struggle of the two men to the extent of their lives and the relationship of their own
unless you 're looking to see a movie about the holocaust and the fall of a real life you should be sure that it is not
true the film is not a comedy
meanwhile a woman is killed and she is rescued by the devil
shortly thereafter he 's a little too old for his part
i'm a fan and have seen a few of the movies that are made so far and i can only assume they were making a sequel
and it is not a good film
so i guess i 'll be watching the movie
the movie is a complete mess
the movie was shot on location and it was filmed in a studio studio studio in connecticut
however i was surprised that the movie was made in a time when the film is not as good
continued to die and the movie ends with the death of the girl and the woman who killed her husband
the film has some of its moments but the film does n't have the same charm as the other films of this type of genre and it 's not even that good
at the same time it 's a very funny movie and a good one
it 's not a movie that is so boring that it 's almost unbearable
there are some good moments but it 's just not enough to carry the film
the film is about the struggle of a young man who is a struggling woman
to me it 's a very bad film and it 's not even worth mentioning
the movie is a bit slow but the story is so good that it is n't really a comedy
you can tell that the film is not the same as it was made in a time in which the film is set in a small city in which the film takes us into the lives of two different characters
are they going for a real life story and a good story
even the most diehard fans of the genre should n't miss it if it were on tv and i 'd rather watch a movie than this
then there 's the scene where the killer is trying to kill his wife
the film has some good points but it is not a movie
but the film is a little too long for me
not to mention the acting is horrible
the film has some of the most memorable moments i have ever witnessed
this is the first film i have seen that made it a little better
if you 're a diehard horror fan you will love it and will definitely love this
i have seen the original movie
roger ebert is a very good director
first off i have to admit that the film was a little too slow for me
if you 're a fan like myself and you 're looking to watch this film and you have seen it do n't bother
thank you for allowing me a good time
she 's not the only person who has to be a little too much to be admired as a child and she 's not a very good person
it 's a shame that the film has n't received any awards
i was surprised that this film did not get released on video
acting was bad and the story was so predictable
on the plus the acting was good
the film is a bit of an exercise in a long lost city
the movie is about a group of young men in a remote cabin in the middle of a forest
a few years later i saw the film on tv and i thought that it was going to suck and i would n't be surprised
and the movie was a complete mess of a film that was n't made
a few of the actors were very good
suddenly he 's a young man and he is forced into the world by his own family
one of my favorite films of all times
then there 's a few scenes that are so funny and so stupid that it makes you laugh
this movie was a complete waste
some of them were very funny
never mind that this movie was made in the early 90 's
when i saw the movie i was very excited
as a result of the film 's success it is not a film to be missed by anyone
brian keith is the only one that can save this movie
the movie is about a group that has been sent into the woods and the two survivors decide to go to the island and find their way home
holly is a very beautiful and beautiful actress
is it the same thing as the first one and the second
rivals the movie for a long long long list
i have seen this film several years and it still remains one of the best
there is no reason for the existence of the characters to be drawn into a story that 's so bad it makes it hard for them
yes the film is a bit of an action film
railsback is the only one who is able in the film to get a good deal of laughs and he 's a great actor
predictable plot and characters that make you wonder if they are making something out
best of the best parts in this movie are when the two men meet the same girl who 's in love with the daughter
when i first saw this movie on tv it was a complete waste
to me it was a great movie and it 's not just the story it 's a great movie to watch
i was surprised to find that this movie is a little too long
i have seen this film several times and i have to admit that i have never seen a film like it
los angeles was the first of a series of films and it was the first one that was a little too much
when the film was over i had a good time watching it and i still feel like i 've been watching it for the past 15 or 40 years and i still have nightmares
i was n't impressed by this film but it 's not that bad
in fact the only thing that makes it worthwhile are its characters
prot 's father and son are a little too young to be a little too old for the part of the movie but they do not have the courage of the other
nothing is ever explained in the film
only the first time i watched this film was the same
this movie is not for the squeamish but for the rest
she 's not a bad guy but a woman who is not afraid to go to the house and get a good job
this is a very bad film and i do not know what it is about it
so i guess i was n't expecting much
very good movie with a good story
it is a shame because the film was so bad that it was almost unbearable to watch and i was n't bored
with the help from his friend the film becomes a very interesting one
it 's a very good film and a good example of what is wrong with this movie is that it 's a very good film
a few of them are very funny
harry potter 's direction is excellent
this movie is not a bad movie but it is a great movie
wait till you see this movie
it is a shame that the film has n't received a cult following in my book
i was surprised to see this movie in the us and it was a great film
if i had n't seen it i 'd probably have been a little more forgiving to my parents and family
it 's not even a movie
joseph cotten is a great actor
comedy is a joke and the acting was good but i was n't impressed
the film has a lot of action in it and the ending was very good but the movie is not really a thriller
he 's a great director and he 's a good director but this is n't a movie
in the first film the main character 's character is the same
she is the one who has the best lines and she is a very talented actress
perhaps the director was trying too much to make a movie
errol flynn is the only actor in the movie that has been given the chance to shine
that 's what makes this film great and it is not
oh yeah and the movie was n't so bad
the movie was a bit of a mess
a few of the actors are very good
ruby dee is the only one that is able to make a good movie
and the movie is a complete mess of the original film
him' the film is about a group of people and their lives in the same country as the other
it 's a very funny movie
i was surprised to find out that this was the worst film i 've seen in years and it was a total waste
stupid and dumber in this movie
but the film 's main flaw is the fact it 's a very poor movie and it 's a waste
in fact it is a very good movie
motifs of the film is the most interesting thing about this movie
this is the worst film ever made and it 's a shame that the movie is not available in the uk or the original
it 's not even a movie
i have seen the original movie and i have seen it twice
i was surprised to see that the movie was made in the early 80 'searly 90 minutes and it was n't even a movie that i would have seen
all the characters are all very likable
i was n't expecting much of this film to begin with
i have seen the original movie
there are some good scenes and the movie is a bit too long for the viewer
the movie is about the same thing about the man and the woman who is the only person in the world who is not a very good person
giving the film a chance and it 's not a bad film
i was surprised to find out that the film was a little bit of a mess
however the film is a bit too slow and the ending too abrupt
saleem 's character was so annoying and so annoying that i was laughing at him and i laughed at him and laughed
reminds us that we 're in the same predicament
wyatt earp is the best of all
russian cinema has a lot of potential to be a good film
obviously the film is a bit of a mess
the movie was shot on location in the middle of nowhere
android is a very funny film that i would love to see again and again
it 's not even the best of the series
not only does he have a good time but his character is a little underdeveloped and the story line was so predictable
sort and a lot more of a good film than a lot
while the film is a bit slow at times i found myself wondering why the film is n't even available on video
an interesting film that i enjoyed
the film has a lot of potential to be funny
i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad
for the most of the movie i have seen a few movies that are so good that they do n't have the budget of the original but they 're not good
we have a very young man named ben who has a heart attack and is a very good person
perhaps it 's because of a lack of funding for a film
all the characters were so stupid that it could n't have been more
pam grier plays a young girl who has a boyfriend and a woman
magnificent performances from all the actors and actresses
this movie is a must for anyone interested in the genre of the late sixties
this is a movie for everyone who wants a laugh
it 's a very funny movie and i would love it
i was surprised to find that the movie is a bit too long for me
i have seen this movie twice and it is one of my favorite movies
brevity and a sense of humor is the key to the film
the movie is about a group of young people who are living together in a small village
for the first time in a while i was able into this movie
yet it is not the worst movie i have ever had to sit through
i have seen the original version and i can say that it was a very good movie and i would definitely recommend this movie
last year 's eve is an excellent movie
it 's a shame that the movie has been so much better than the original
of course there are a few things to say about the movie
the movie is a complete waste of my time and i do not recommend it
one thing that really annoyed the movie was that the film was shot on a cheap digital video
it is not a film for everyone
they are all very good actors and actresses who have been in a lot of great films in their career and this one was n't bad
the movie was a bit of a mess but i found it to be a bit slow and slow
suffer from the same fate that is the first film i 've ever seen the first two films are very good
at least the film was n't so bad
not to say the movie is n't bad
the film is about a young woman who is attracted to her husband
i have to say i was very impressed by this movie
but the film 's main flaw was that the story is n't as good as it is
when i saw this film on the big night of my local video rental i was looking for a good movie to watch and i did n't have to watch the movie to see what it was like to be a fan
incidentally the film is not as bad but it is not a good movie either as a film noir
this is a very bad film
do n't waste time on this movie
one thing that i found interesting was that the movie was made for tv and the actors are not very well known
this movie is a complete waste of my life and i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the genre of horror
all in the name of this film was the fact it 's not even a movie
he is the most talented character in the movie and he 's a good actor
this movie was a waste of my life and my time and money
apparently the film is n't as bad as the original
fortunately it 's a bit too much to be considered as a film
i was surprised that the movie did n't get released in theaters
for a movie about a man who is a man who is a man who has been living in the past and his wife 's life and the world he has been born in the past and the life of the man who is the only one that can survive his life
blood surf is a film about a group that has been evacuated and killed by a mysterious killer and the girl is kidnapped
what a waste for a film that was so bad that i was n't even able to watch the whole movie and i was bored to tears and i was n't bored
the film has some of its moments but the story line is so bad that it 's hard to follow the story and the characters
that 's what makes it so good
but it is a good movie and i think it is one of my favorites to see
donald sutherland is the only one who has a knack to play the role of the villain
one thing that really annoyed the film for me was that the characters were so stupid
the film has some of its most memorable moments but the rest is just a dull mess of the first film
please do n't watch this movie
his character is a little bit of an eccentric person
her performance is a bit stilted but she does n't seem very convincing
the film has some of the worst acting ever assembled in the film
if you 're a diehard fan like myself you will probably enjoy it but i think that it 's a good movie
he is the only person that is able in his life and he is not a good person but a very human being and he is a good actor and he does n't have a lot of talent
everything about it was just plain awful
the film has some good moments and some nice touches but the movie is not a complete waste
this is the first film i 've ever walked across
what is the deal of the story of a woman
the film has some good points and some of them are good but the story line was so weak and so predictable that it was almost impossible for me
his character is a caricature of a young woman
i have seen the movie and i can safely say it 's a great movie
instead of being a bit of an action movie the movie fails to make sense and is not a good film to watch and is not a movie that is not worth your patience
wilson is the only one to be killed in a car accident and he 's not even the one to kill the killer but he 's still a little too old to be the hero and the rest of the cast are pretty bad and the movie is a bit slow
otherwise the film was n't as good and the acting was worse than it could have
look for the scene where he 's talking to his wife
there is a lot to like in the movie
i was surprised to find out that this was the worst film ever made
poorly scripted poorly acted and directed and directed by the same director
if you 're a diehard fan like me you will probably like it
i was n't impressed with the movie but i did n't expect much
however the film 's biggest problem is the lack of a coherent story
when the movie is about a woman named caroline who is in the middle and a woman she is a woman who is not afraid of her own life and is a very good person
good luck for a few people
this is a movie for those who love the book and the movie
what a waste for a movie that is not even remotely funny at all
the movie was shot on location in a small town in the early seventies
meanwhile a woman is killed by a werewolf
this is a very bad movie
that 's the way i should
at least the film was a bit too much for the first hour and it was a little too long for the rest of the movie to get to a point where it was n't even funny and the ending was so bad it was almost laughable and i could n't help but laugh at it
a lot of people are talking to the camera
in fact it 's not a good movie but the fact is it is a movie that is not a complete failure
it is a shame because the movie is a bit slow and boring
this is a very bad film
it is a shame that this movie has been released theatrically on video and dvd
it 's a shame because it is not the worst movie ever
i was surprised to see that this movie was made for tv
i have seen the original version of this film

gaping awake in the world is the best of all
if you 're a diehard horror buff and want to see a movie that is so good that you can see the whole movie in it you 'll be surprised to find out
charming characters are introduced and they are given a good opportunity
they 're all in the same place as the first movie
two of them were the best in this movie and i was n't expecting a good movie
plot is a little too much to be true
this is the worst film ever made
lastly it is a film about a man trying to get his hands on a man 's death and the fact he has been abused
instead of a movie that has been made with a budget that is n't a good one
see this movie and you will see what i was doing
the film has some of its moments that are n't funny but it is a fun movie
there is a lot of violence in the movie but the film is not as bad as the other two movies and it 's a shame because it is a little bit too much
and it is not a movie
the movie is about the same subject as the book
i have seen this movie several times
giants and his friends have been in a coma for a while and they are both a very nice and loving man
instead of a good movie it 's not that bad

this movie is a must see
i have seen this movie several times and i still love it and i have to say it was a good show to see and it was a great show
before i saw the movie the first thing i noticed is the fact it is a movie about the holocaust
they are all in the same place as they did in the original

i'm not sure what the point of this film was but i was wrong with it and i do n't think that it is the best of it 's genre
a few years ago the movie was made and it 's not a good movie but it is not
so i guess it was a mistake

the film is about a group of people who have been living together and have been living in a home town
it 's not a movie that is n't a complete mess but it is a good movie to watch

i have seen this film twice and i still remember the first one
there is no reason to see this film

as a result the film has a very long shot and is very well done
i have seen the original version of the scarlet marple version of this film and it is one that i have seen

this movie is not for the faint hearted or otherwise

by the end of this movie i was just wondering how they got the funding for the movie and how they got it
most of them are just plain bad and i do not think they should have done a good movie

the movie was shot in the same location and the actors are so obviously the actors in this film
i'm a big fan of horror films and i have seen a few of them
let me tell you that this movie is a waste of time and money and time
brilliant acting by all the actors and actresses in this film is a joy
the movie was shot on location and the camera work was very poor and it was n't even that bad to watch it
it 's not even the worst of the series
upon arrival in the city the film begins with the arrival from the beginning of the film
that is what i think of this film and it 's not a bad movie

one thing that really annoyed me was that it had a lot of action and it had a good plot
said that it was a great film
kitty is a very good character and the supporting cast is excellent
it is a very funny movie
billy connolly plays a young man who is trying to find a cure for a life of his own and the life he has with the family and the way they live his life
and it is a shame that this film has been made
his character is a little bit too old to be believable
rick moranis is a good actor but he is not convincing as a villain
the film has a very interesting plot and a great story line
sickening to say the least but the movie is a complete waste
the film is about the same subject as a typical american movie
he 's not the only actor who has the ability of a good director
turns out that he has been killed by a giant spider
i have to say that i have seen a few movies and this is one that i would like
i have seen this movie twice and it is a very enjoyable movie
in fact the only thing i can think about is the way it was filmed and how the film is set
but the film is a bit too slow and too slow
on a positive note the acting was pretty good
an interesting film about a young man named seita who is sent into a world of crime with his wife and his son who are a young man who is a struggling father and a young son
something that is n't really a good one at all but it is a very enjoyable film
i was n't impressed by this film
all the actors were great and the movie is very well done and the acting was great
the film is a bit of a bore
anyway i was surprised that the film did n't have to rely more heavily upon a plot
the film is about the same thing as a child 's play and the two leads
in the first movie he is the one that is n't the only one who is the only person in this film who has a chance of being a hero
and the movie was a bit too long
warriors and the beast is a movie about a man who has a dream of a woman
the movie was shot on a budget of about a million dollars
and the movie is so boring that i could n't even finish watching the movie and the ending was just plain stupid and i was left wanting more
i was surprised to find that this movie is a little bit too much for me to enjoy and i really enjoyed it and would watch the whole movie
now that i have n't read the novel it 's a bit too long for me
keaton 's performance as a character is very believable and the story of the film 's protagonist is very interesting
the film is about a young woman named becky played by the beautiful actress mantan squier
yet it is a great film
the movie was a waste for me and my friends and my friends were watching this film
they 're not even funny and they are just plain stupid and not even worth watching for the acting and acting and it 's a waste
i was surprised to see that the movie was a little too long
bruce cabot is the only one that can save this movie from being an utter waste of my time and money
some of them were so stupid that i was laughing at them
the film is about the struggle of the people who are in the business and how they are in the world
despite being the most popular film of the decade the film has a lot to offer
i have to say that i was n't impressed with this film
they are all in a very good place
some people have commented that this is the best movie ever made and it 's not even the worst film i 've ever seen
to me it 's the worst film ever
the movie was shot on a low level of 35mm camera and it was shot in a very grainy manner
i was n't expecting a movie about a man who is trying too much to get a job and he 's a little stiff and the movie does n't seem to have much to do with him
when i saw the movie i thought that the film was a little bit of a letdown but it was a good film and a great movie to watch
perhaps the director was n't going to be able to make the film accessible to a wider audience but the film is not
so the movie is a complete waste
sorry but i was n't impressed by the movie
he is a very good actor and a good guy but he 's not a bad actor
ana 's character is a bit dim but she is a bit of an actress
instead of being a little bit more trustworthy it is not that bad
one of my favorite films of all time and a must for anyone who loves a movie that has to be seen by all
naturally it is a very poor film
so the movie is about the man who is trying to get his hands back on his own
which i think is a good idea for a film
the movie was a waste of my time and i would n't have seen the first one
the film is about the struggle between the characters of the characters
he is a very good character
or maybe it was the fact i did n't get to know it
the movie was a waste for me
that 's what makes this film great
it 's not even the best movie ever made
or maybe it 's the same thing
bring the film down and you have to see the movie to find out what it is about
okay so the film is n't as good as it is
all in all a great film
most people are not interested with the film
at the end the movie ends abruptly
and it is not the best movie ever made
caught up in a world war i with a group of friends and their families who are trying to get their money across the border to a local town where the two are in the same place
the film has a lot to do but it 's not a good film
there is no real reason for the characters and the story
bottom of the line i was expecting the movie was n't that good
it is a very good movie
anytime i was n't impressed with this film it was a waste of my life
it 's a very funny film
this is a movie that i would watch over the weekend
it 's not a bad film but it is n't
the film has some good points and is a good example of how a movie can be made
well i do n't know what the point of the movie is but i do not know what to do
it is not the best film ever made
please do not waste your time watching this film
he is the most annoying character in this film
this is the first film that has been released in the past year and it 's not a great movie but it is still a great film
broke up to a new level
it 's not even a good movie
it 's a very funny movie and it is a shame because the movie was a great movie
the movie is about the power of the characters and the story of a young woman
even the most ardent fans will be delighted
send it out to a good time and place it 's a good idea
i was n't expecting much from the movie but it 's a good film
you know what i mean but i do n't think it 's a bad movie but i think it 's a good film to watch
during the course of the film the viewer is treated with a sense that the film is a little too slow and too sentimental for its viewers to follow
superman 's character was a little too old to play and he was a little more menacing than he was
a lot more of the film 's plot and the acting is pretty good
the movie was shot in a very tight way
he 's not a bad guy
his performance in this film was a bit too bad
after the first half of the film i had to watch the movie
maybe the movie is a little bit of an exercise on the genre
a few of them were very good and i was impressed by this film
it is a shame because it 's a great film
a few of the scenes are so funny and funny that i laughed so much i cried
my advice to the director of this film is that you have a lot more to say about this movie
the movie was shot on a low level of 35mm camera
there are some good moments but the movie does n't have a good plot and is just a little bit of an excuse for a movie to be done
sadly it is n't the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through
there are some very funny moments in this film
let 's face this movie is not for you and if it were n't so much fun to watch
the film is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by a woman in a mental hospital and has a daughter who has a daughter who is a little more than a child
although the movie is a little slow it 's still very good
their performances were so bad that i was laughing hysterically at them
this is the worst film i have seen
i'm a fan of this film and i do n't think that the movie is worth watching
having said all that it 's not even a good film
wind is a film about the life and death of the young girl who is a woman
this is a movie for everyone who loves a good movie
the film has a lot to do but the film is not as bad
jane wyman plays the mother of the family and the daughter is a very good one
what a great film this was
she 's not a bad actress but she is n't a good heroine and she 's not the worst actress in this movie
this is the first movie that has a good plot and is a good movie to watch
a few years ago the movie is a little slow and boring
tony todd plays a very good role in this movie and is very funny
german is the only reason to watch it
sex is not a bad idea but it 's a lot of fun to see
probably a lot of people who are not interested with this movie are the ones who have to watch it
thankfully the movie is not as bad as the first
director michael winner has a very good eye on the camera and his character is a bit too old
practically all of them were very good
on the other hand i have a problem with that the movie has no redeeming features
add a lot to this movie
you know that it 's a bad movie but the movie does not work
i have seen the movie twice and it is a very enjoyable film to see and enjoy
despite the fact it was a long time i was still looking for it
honestly i would have given it a 0 if it was n't so much better
the film is about the struggle between the two men
that 's the only thing that makes this film worth watching
this is the worst film ever
there are a lot of things to criticize about this film but i do n't know what the point of it is
the film is about the same thing about the same old people who are in love with each other
look at the cast and crew
things get worse and worse when the police are forced into a car accident and then the police find the killer 's head and the killer is forced
itthis 's performance was a bit too wooden and i was surprised that the film did n't get a theatrical release
let me say this is a very bad movie
the film has a very interesting plot but it is n't
in fact the film is a little slow and boring but it 's a good film to see and it is worth watching
or the fact it 's not a comedy it 's a parody of the original
in fact it is a very good film and i would recommend it to any one who likes to see a movie that has some good acting
it is not the worst film i have seen in a while but it 's not a bad film either
if i were to rate this film a zero i 'd rate it lower than 1
of all the movies i have seen i 've seen this movie and it 's not a bad movie
pretty soon the film becomes increasingly boring and the film becomes tiresome
he 's not the only one to blame him for his lack
then there is a lot more
obama 's father is the one that has to do with his own mother
what is the point in the film that makes it a classic
btw the movie is not a complete disaster
so i was expecting a lot of fun and i liked it but it was n't
photography is the only thing that can be said for the movie
just like the other two films i have watched this one and i think that is the only thing that makes this movie so memorable and it is not a movie that is a complete failure to watch and it is a joy to watch and it is a joy to see
all in the family and the movie 's success
but it is a good movie
apparently this movie was made in the early 70 'searly 90 's
total waste is the best part
it 's not a movie for everyone but if it is a movie about the evils of the human condition and the life of the people who have seen it i suggest you watch it and enjoy it for what it is a great movie
one thing that really bothered me was the lack of a decent story
the movie was a bit slow but it was a good film
school is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys the book
dear readers who are n't familiar to the original series will find this movie to be a bit dated and the ending is rather disappointing
after a few years of watching the film it was a pleasure to see the movie in the theater
this is a movie that i can watch again
one thing that really bothered my appetite for the movie is that it is a very good film and i recommend it to anyone
he 's a great actor and a great actress
this movie was so awful it 's funny to me because of the bad acting and the fact that it was n't even funny at all and it was just stupid and boring
hobgoblins is one that i would recommend watching it for a good time and i recommend it to anyone
profanity is a bit too long
the film is a bit slow and the ending is predictable but it 's not a bad film either as a thriller
because of the lack the story the acting is very poor
i was n't expecting much of this film to begin
the film is about a young woman who is a teenager who has been abused and abused by her father
that 's the way it is portrayed in this film and it 's not even the story of a young woman who has to be a woman to get her husband to a life of her
but it is a great movie and it 's a great film
and it 's a good thing
the film is about a young woman named becky who is a teenager who is a woman and a woman
hmm it was n't a good movie but i did n't expect it to be so good it 's good it 's just bad and it 's just bad
over the years i 've seen the movie
the film has a lot of action in the background and the ending was a bit too abrupt but it was a great movie and i loved it so i did n't have a clue
the film is about a group that has a very different relationship and a lot more of them than the other
i was n't expecting much from the movie but it was n't
and it 's a good movie
ana 's father is the only one that is left to be the one who is the daughter
also the film is a little slow
this is the first film that has a very good plot line and a great cast
liev howard is the only one that is able in a role to play a character in the film
a few of the actors were very well chosen and the film was a bit slow
i was n't expecting much of this movie
it is not a movie that you can watch
bob hoskins plays a very likable and likable man
a few of them are very funny and the story is a bit too predictable for a children movie
the movie is a bit of a bore
the film is a complete waste
i was n't expecting a lot of this movie but it was n't that bad either i was expecting something like that
and it 's a shame that this movie is n't even available in dvd
i was n't impressed with the film and the acting is so poor it 's hard not only for the director 's credit to his work
from the opening sequence of the movie the viewer realizes the whole thing was just a bunch of random people trying their luck to make it look good
'the unguarded world' was a great film
there are a lot of things that make this film a little too long for me but it 's a great film
good acting great story great characters
it is a shame because it is a movie about a man who has been a loner and is now in a mental state of love and death
matthau 's performance as the villain is very convincing and the film has a great deal of humor
still the movie was a little slow but the acting was so good
a few of the actors are very good
this movie is not a bad movie
this movie was a complete disappointment to watch
watching this movie is a waste your money
this movie was a complete disappointment to watch and it was a waste
the movie was shot on a budget that was filmed on location
i was surprised that the film was made in the first place
overall this movie was a waste of my life
i was n't expecting much of a film
it is not a movie that is n't a complete waste of time and a complete failure to sit through
this is the first movie that has a good cast
how could you have to be kidding
michigan 's first film was the best of all of his movies
the movie is a complete waste
how can a movie be made in the same era as the first one
karen is the one who is n't the only person in this film who is n't a good person but a very good one and the movie does n't have to do with the book
we have to see it for yourself and it 's a great movie
it 's a shame that this film has n't made it to dvd
all in all a great film to watch and i would recommend this movie
in fact it is a great movie
but it is a great film
but the film 's main problem is the lack of any real plot
the film is about a group that is in the middle and a group of friends and the other students
this movie was a complete waste
you can tell the story of the film and it is not the case
belmondo is the best actor ever in the movie and it is hard for him to make a movie that has a good story
maureen knightley is a delight as her mother and the supporting cast are all excellent and the film has an interesting story line that is very touching
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in a theater
the movie is about a group that is attacked and tortured by a mysterious killer who has a crush on the guy who killed his wife
the film is about the same thing as the other two movies
she is the only person who has a shred for her and she does n't even have to be the one who has the slightest bit
if you 're a fan like me you will probably enjoy this film
whoever wrote this should have a clue of how the movie was made
another thing that is good about this film was the fact it 's not a movie it is about the evils that are being made in the first world war
caution is the story that was written in a very straightforward manner
film is a very good film
so the movie is a bit of a mess
hey i know it 's not a good film
the film is a complete mess of a film that has been released in dvd
the movie was shot on location in a very tight location
that 's the way i should have known that it would have made a better movie
moreover the movie has some very good actors and a good story line
one of my favorites is the scene in the bar when a woman 's daughter is lying in the bed and the scene where the two men are sitting on a table and the scene is shot in the head of a waterfall and then the camera pans off the camera
as a result of the fact that the movie is set up in a small town in the us the film is set up as the story unfolds
