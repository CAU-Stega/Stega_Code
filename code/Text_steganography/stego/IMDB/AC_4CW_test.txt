we are shown a lot of people who do not know what to do and are n't
and the ending is a bit anticlimatic
also the film was shot in a studio in the united states
she 's a very talented woman
hackneyed plot line and a plot line that is n't even worth mentioning
basic instinct of the gods is a very good movie and i would recommend this film
like the other reviewer i 've never seen the movie
in this case the movie is about a man who has been a successful pianist in a long time and he is a very good person and a person who is a man who loves himself and his wife and his son
this is one of those films i like and it is not the worst movie i have ever seen
and i do n't want to give anything away
he 's a good actor but he does not have a chance to play his role
not only is this movie a complete waste of time
she is a very talented woman but the movie 's main character is not a character she 's supposed to play
meanwhile the movie is a complete mess and the ending is just plain stupid
i do n't understand why this movie was so bad and i would not have seen it
unfortunately the film is n't as good as the first
yes it is a great movie but it is a movie that is not worth the time
it 's a great story about a young boy who has been a loner and has a daughter who is a little bit of a jerk
dr hackenstein is one of the most underrated films i have ever seen
read the book instead it 's a waste of your time
if you are a fan of the original you will find the story very interesting
now i am a fan of the genre and i have to say i was n't too much of a fan of the genre but the movie was a bit too long
the film is not a documentary about a man who 's trying to find the woman
i do not think that the director was trying to make this a movie
mitchell is the best actor in the whole film
eventually the two main character 's are the ones who are the most interesting characters in the history
please do n't watch this film
frank sinatra is a great actor but he 's not a bad actor
clichs are not funny but the acting is pretty good and i think it was a good movie
and the ending is a bit abrupt but it 's just a great surprise
seen the movie and i think the film is a bit too long
and that does n't make sense to anyone
dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
anyway this is a very good film
the acting is good the writing is bad the script is awful the acting is awful and the story is just plain stupid and stupid
the story is very good and the acting and the story are very good
i was so bored that i did n't even notice the movie
good thing is that the movie is so bad it 's funny
although it is not as bad as the original i think it 's the best of the three
so if you want to watch a movie that is a waste of time and money
by the way the story is a bit slow
it 's a shame that the film never got released in theaters
the story is a bit slow and predictable
ok it was the first time i saw the movie i was n't sure what was going on in my life but i guess i did n't like the movie
not that i have any qualms of the film but the story is a good one and i think it 's a shame that the movie has a lot more to offer than it is
he 's a great actor and is very good in the role
everyone is so stupid and the whole film is about the same
they were so good and the movie was so bad it made it hard to sit through
it was a good idea to make a film with a good story line but that is about it
from the opening scene the movie wraps up a bit and it is a very enjoyable film and one that i enjoyed the most
el charro is one of those films that you can actually see in the theatre
but i was surprised to find that it had been made by a group of friends and i have to say i was n't impressed with this movie
being a huge fan of the first two films i have to say i was a little disappointed by the fact that this was a low budget film
version of the movie the story of a man who is trying to get to the bottom of the earth
they are all very good and are very funny
but i have to say this was one of the best movies i have ever seen
i was surprised by the amount of money spent on this film and the actors were so good that i could n't help but think that it would have been a great movie
as the movie progresses we learn that there is no way that the family would have been killed and the family is a bit more than a child
i have to agree with another reviewer who commented on this
bottom line this is a great show
i was n't sure whether i had a good time or just want to see a few of the scenes
it 's the kind of film that makes the viewer think about how the world is going to turn into a movie that will make you want to be a part of your life
however the plot is a bit too weak for a movie
these were the days of the great depression
in this movie he 's a very talented man who 's a very good man
there is a lot of nudity in the film and there are a couple of scenes which are very well done
the film has a great cast including the likes of john carradine and a very good performance by robert duvall
the movie has a few good scenes but it is n't that bad
he was a very nice guy
and the movie is not as bad as the first movie but it 's not a bad movie either
in the end i was n't sure whether it was the script or the acting but the acting was so bad i had to turn it off
it 's a great movie to watch
1 out of 10 i would recommend watching it
obviously the film has been released in the us and the film is a bit over the top
and the film is not a total disaster it is just as good as the first film
i have to say that the movie was pretty bad
seems to be a joke to the film 's audience
but the film is not a good movie
the acting is very poor the plot and the acting is horrible
she is not the most convincing actress in this film
jealous of the death penalty the movie is set in the same building
'the unguarded is a very good example of a good movie
sounds like it is shot in a video camera
spoilers ahead the film was shot in a small town in mexico and it is a very nice movie to look at
but the movie is a complete mess
about the only thing that i can say is that it was a waste of time
it 's a pity that the movie has been released on dvd in the us
however i have seen a few movies and it 's a very bad movie
actually this is the worst movie of all time i have to admit that i am a huge fan of horror movies but this is one of the worst
even the actors in this movie are not bad
thankfully the movie is not as bad as the first
arming the two in a very good way
it is n't even a movie
well it is a movie that is n't afraid to be a comedy or even a horror movie
a few years later the movie is set in the future where it is set in the future
i was n't expecting much from this movie
the film has a very nice atmosphere
check it out if you 're a diehard fan of the genre and have a lot of fun watching this
it 's not a good movie
he is the best actor in the movie as a character
if it were n't so bad they could n't have made a better movie
this film is a must see film
in fact the film was a little too long for me to really get into it
which brings me to the point that it is a film that is not only the best of the genre but also the fact that it is not a movie
the movie is a bit of a mess but it 's not a great movie
the movie was shot on the cheap and the story is so poor that it is hard to watch
mortal kombat is a movie that is not only a comedy but a comedy
this film is a complete waste of time
made for tv and the movie is a bit too slow
especially the scene where he tells the girl that he 's going to be the only person in this movie that he has n't seen in a while is a good idea
to me the most memorable scene is the scene with a man in drag
of course there is a lot of the film 's humor and it is a film that is n't afraid of any kind of a true story
the acting and direction is superb and the script is a bit of a mess
all in all a good film
but it is a good movie
this movie is one of the best of all times
but the film 's biggest problem is the ending
they are the only people who are able to make their life
he was the only one who seemed to have been in a lot of trouble with his family and his family was n't really the same as a kid who is a little more than a little kid
also i think this is a very good movie
it 's a shame because the movie does n't have a lot of plot and is a bit of a bore
we are supposed to be a bit of a fan of these two movies
on the plus side there are some very funny moments in this film
the film has an interesting plot and the acting is superb
unlike the first one the characters are not very interesting and the story is not a complete disaster
it was n't a great idea to make a movie about the dangers of a child and the consequences that were made
his wife and daughter are the only ones in the movie that are so good
but the film is so much better
nothing about the film is interesting
nothing really happens and i did n't care for anything else
he 's a great director and a good writer
mara is a great actor and is a very underrated actress
it was a waste of time and money
we have a lot of people who can be so stupid and so bad that you just want to watch this movie again
it was a great movie and it was fun to watch
they were all so funny that they were all good and funny
the film is a little too long for the most part and the story is n't very good
i do n't think that the movie was a good idea to make a film
ulmer 's film is a masterpiece of a film that has a very good cast
there 's a lot of gore in this film but there 's no suspense or violence
sure the film does n't have a lot to do with the first two but it is a good movie that will leave you with a smile
everyone involved in this production should be ashamed of themselves
the acting is pretty bad the story is awful and the characters are just annoying
this film is a complete mess of mine
i was n't expecting anything from this movie
of course it is the story of a woman who has to deal with the loss of the mother who she has been living in
the film is a very funny movie
wow this is a great movie
and i was so impressed with this film
incidentally the movie is a bit slow and boring
every time she 's on screen she is not even in this one
this movie is a must see for any serious person who loves to be scared and just plain bad
i do n't think i can even remember the title song of the film
he is a good actor but he 's a bit over his head
seeing the film is a very good film that is very rare in the us
heading to a small town to attend the town and spend all the money on a farm
if i had to give a 0 rating then i 'd go to the cinema and rent it
madhuri rai and her husband are both good in the roles
the film has a very nice feel to it
but it is not a film
i was expecting something like the original but the acting was terrible
but i have to admit that this is one of the best movies ever made
dutch 's first feature film was a great film that was made for the screen
she is also in the film
why is n't it that a movie with such an amateurish premise would be made for a good movie
the movie is about a group of kids who have to fight against a bunch of kids who want to kill people and try to get them to be in the house
the film is very slow moving
throughout the movie the film is a very dark film about a man who 's been born in the united states
bits of this film have no relevance to it
the movie is very good and the acting is superb
ff7 is a great example of how to do a documentary
more importantly i was able to see a few of them
the movie has a lot of action and the plot was pretty cool and i was surprised that this movie got made and it was n't a total waste of time
but the movie does n't really have any real plot to it
what i did see was that it had a lot to do with the first one
the movie is a complete waste of time
the acting is good but it is not as if the actors were reading the lines they had
this was a great film to watch
the film is about a young man who is a teenager and is now a loner
though i have n't read the book i have n't seen the original
maybe i should give this a 10
some of them were very good
which is what the story is about
shannon is a very good actor
in the end the movie ends with a bang and the end is so bad that i could n't believe it
hercules and the bandit is one of the most overrated and boring movies i have ever seen
even though this is not an action movie it is n't a bad film
the film was shot in a very small country and the film is a very good one
blood and guts is a very entertaining movie that will make you laugh
he was a great actor and i loved him
what 's with the whole idea of this movie
angle and the movie is a good movie to watch
for the most part i was impressed with the story and the acting
but the real problem here is that the film does not make a lot of sense at the end
but the film does n't have to be a complete waste of time and money
it 's a pity that the film is n't even available for dvd
i do n't want to spoil the plot
by the end of the movie you are left wondering if the movie is a good idea
the film has a lot of good points but is n't really the same
the acting was terrible the plot was bad and the acting was bad
i think the director and director were trying to make a movie that was so bad that it was n't scary
i was so impressed with it
this is not a movie for kids
complaining about the film 's shortcomings and its impact on the subject matter
skilled director john boorman 's film is the story of a young boy who is sent to a mental hospital in the country to be reunited in an old man 's home
cagney 's performance is a bit stiff and the film is a little bit of a stretch for the viewer
this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
last but not least a few scenes of a man who is a witch in the woods
did n't you think that this was a movie that was a joke
considering the fact that the film is set in the us it is a film that is not only a vehicle for a film but also a film that is n't just a vehicle of how to make a movie
for the rest of it you can get a sense of what it 's like to be in a coma or at least a little bit of a joke
will smith and his wife are in the film
the story is about a group of young people who are trapped in a small island in new mexico city in the late 1930 's
for those who have n't seen it yet have n't seen it yet it is a great film to watch for all
i do n't want to spoil the movie for you
this is a very bad movie
law enforcement is a very interesting and interesting movie
i have n't read a book that is n't as bad as i thought it would be
i have seen a lot of bad movies but this one is so bad that i ca n't even begin to describe how bad this film is
if you want a real good movie this is the movie to be avoided
i was expecting a lot more from this film
the film is about a man who 's been diagnosed with a man who 's been killed by a man
he 's a great actor and i think he 's a very talented actor
batman returns is a very funny horror film with a few laughs but it is n't enough
this movie was so bad it 's funny
i was n't sure whether the movie was intentional but it is n't
not only is the story a little too predictable it does have a lot to do with the story of the characters
the story of the movie is a little too thin for the most younger audience to watch and it is not a movie
their relationship is the best thing about the movie and i think the director was trying too hard to make a film
this movie was so awful i could not bear to sit through it
the acting is very good and there are some good performances
all in all i would recommend the film for anyone interested in the subject of the book
the film 's main flaw is that the film is a little slow at times
the movie is about a young woman who is married to her mother and her mother who is in love with the mother
can you imagine a lot of people in this film
it 's the story of a young woman in her life who is a bit of a dysfunctional family
now i have to admit that i am not a fan of the original
the movie has a lot to recommend it
i do n't know why i did not see this movie at all
either way it 's a great movie
besides that the film is a very good film and it is not a bad film
always the best of the bunch
she 's not a great actor but she has a great voice
they 're the only ones who have to be the worst
as a result the film is a complete failure
full moon was the most interesting thing to come out of this movie
would n't you have had to have a little more time
purple rain is a very good and entertaining film about a man who has been living in a small town in a small village and has been a quadriplegic for his life
richards 's character was a little too cocky and the plot was so predictable that the movie could not have been so bad
notice that the film is a complete mess
while it is n't as good as some of the other movies the movie is not very well done
in the movie the main character is played by a young man
now the story is about a young man who is a man and a woman
plot holes are the main points of the movie and the ending is a complete mess
it 's not even a good movie
he is a man who is not afraid to be a hero but a very good one
there was a lot of nudity in it
but it 's not that bad
the film 's plot is so simple and predictable that it 's hard to believe it was ever written
my only complaint is that it has the potential to be a good film
the acting is good and the script is a good one
this movie was so bad that you could n't believe it
i was surprised to find that it was a very good and very entertaining film
it is a movie that has been done by the same people as the ones that have seen them in a different way
in fact the film is so bad it 's almost funny
what a waste of time and money
this movie has a lot of action scenes and it is a bit slow but it 's not that good
james stewart plays a very good guy who is n't really a hero
after the movie i was a bit surprised by the fact that the film is a complete mess
the film is not a documentary but it is still a great film
the film is a bit of a mess
i was expecting a lot better but it was n't
there are some very interesting and funny scenes in the movie but they are n't really funny
i have to say i have seen the movie twice and i can only assume that it is a movie that is not worth renting and is a movie about the hardships of the human spirit and the way that people are portrayed
besides the fact that this movie is not a comedy it is an excellent piece of work
all in all i would recommend it to any fan of the original or even a fan of the genre
poor script poor script and a poor script
a good movie for the entire family
they are both a great movie
collier 's character is a bit too much to be taken from a real life
the film is not a documentary of the holocaust but it is about a young man who is in the business and has a heart attack
for the most part the movie is n't bad at all
technically the movie was a waste of time and the fact that it is not even mentioned in a movie
another thing that is missing is the fact that it is a movie that is so bad it 's good but the rest of the movie is not bad
the movie was a little too much to be enjoyed but i think it 's the worst movie ever made
she is a very good actress and is not a good actress
berkeley is a very good actor
sure it is a little too talky but the movie is not a complete waste of time
james woods plays a very good role in the role
when he is in the hospital and he is forced to leave the car and the car is blown away he decides he can do the same thing
all in all a very entertaining movie that is a must see for all fans of italian cinema
i think this is a good film to see and i would recommend to everyone
these two characters were not believable
i do n't think it is that bad
the film has a great deal of suspense and the story is very interesting
maybe the best part is the ending where the girl is in a mental hospital where she is a woman
katharine hepburn is the best in this one
well it 's a good movie and i think it 's a good movie for a rainy day
i do n't want to give away any of the plot
overall this film is not a great movie
but it is n't the worst film i 've ever seen but it does n't have to be
when the film was made and the first half is the best one of the three is a great example of how a movie is about a young girl who is in love with the girl who has a crush on a woman
otherwise this is not a movie that will make you want to watch the movie and to see it again
then there is the fact that the film is set in the present and it is a little too long
the acting is pretty good and the script is a little too predictable
it is the most powerful and funniest film of the year and a perfect example of what is wrong with the film
of course it 's not the best movie of the last century
but the movie does n't have a lot of good things to do with it
this was the only movie i saw with a budget of 10 and i was impressed
later the movie is about a young woman who has a boyfriend who is a bit of a jerk
when you 're watching the movie you 'll see that it is a very low budget film
gracie is a very beautiful and very attractive actress but her performance is very well done and is a joy to watch
mpaa rated r for violence strong language sexual content and some sexual situations
this is a very funny movie and one that i would recommend to anyone looking for some good fun and great action movie
ps this is a very good movie
uzumaki is a very good film
a lot of people who say this is a bad film
i do n't think that it is the best of the series
those are the only reasons why it is so funny
a good movie that i would watch over and over again and watch it again
if you have n't seen it do so
to be honest the film is a little too long
quite a good movie and a great story to watch if you 're into a good horror movie
a few years ago the movie was released in the united states and the us government is a great place for a film
and the ending is a bit abrupt
worth a look for those of you who have not seen the movie
the film is a little too much for the younger generation
it has been done so many times in the film
in this movie the characters are all very likable
sucked from the beginning to the end i was n't sure whether the movie was intentional or not but it was a good movie
it is a very good film and it 's not just a story of two sisters and their relationship with each other
there is a reason for this film
i do n't think that it 's a good idea for a movie but the director does n't know how to make a movie
what 's more interesting about the film is that it 's not so much the same kind of movie as the other films that have n't been made
the movie is a complete mess with a lot of plot holes but a lot of fun
from there on the movie is a mess
the film is a complete waste of time
there 's also a scene with the girl that is supposed to be the main character in the movie
do n't waste your time on this
on the other hand if you 're going to make a horror film with a good plot then go and see this one
what 's the point of this
it has the same kind of humor that is used throughout the movie and it 's very refreshing to see a movie like this
the film has a lot of action and the acting is excellent
i'm not sure what the hell is going on here
is it a comedy or a comedy
horus is a film that has to be seen to be believed
the film is a little bit too dark and the plot is too predictable
the movie is not a comedy or drama
anyone who has seen this film should see this movie
here we have an excellent performance of the young actress
it 's a shame because it 's a little too long for the story and not enough
i have seen this film twice and it 's still a pleasure to watch
i have never heard of this film and i'm amazed that it is not available on dvd as well
as the film progresses it becomes a bit too long and it 's too long
yes it was a little bit too much for a movie
pointless and pointless and not funny in the least
he 's the only one who has a crush on the man who has been in a mental institution for the past
might have been a bit more interesting
where the hell did they get it
dear the film is a complete failure and i have n't seen the first two
murray 's character is so annoying and so stupid that he does not even have any personality
those of you who have not read the book should be aware of it
villains and dolls and the film is a complete mess
if you 're a fan of the original you 'll probably enjoy this film
nobody is a little too old to have the chance to be a good movie
at least the movie is a little bit of fun
13 out of 10 rounded up to 8 stars
monty python is a very talented director
filthy white man is an old man who has a crush on the man who is a man and he is not afraid of being a man in his own home but he is not alone
we 're supposed to be rooting for him and he does n't know what to do with her
little did i know that it was the worst movie ever
we are left to ponder what 's going on in the first place
and it was a great film
perhaps the director is trying to make a statement about the meaning of the situation but the director fails miserably
well the first time i saw the trailer it was a bit of a disappointment
you can watch the whole show
he 's not a great actor he is just a great actor
it 's not a good film but a very enjoyable one
the movie is a bit of a bore
to me it 's a very bad movie and the acting is horrible the plot is bad and the plot is stupid
i do n't think that the director intended the film to be a good movie
i was expecting a good film but it was n't
they are not the same people who have seen this one
low budget film with a few exceptions
the film is about a group of four young men who get together with a young man named billy barty
i think it 's a good movie to watch with a bunch of friends in a theater
makes me think of the movie as an example of how a film is in the vein of a great movie
i have to say that it is one of the worst films i have ever seen
viewers of the original film will be delighted to find it difficult to suspend disbelief for a film that has to have been made
i have never been a big fan of hers and the movie is very much an adaptation of the original novel and i have seen it several times
this movie is one of the most boring films i 've ever seen
two of my favorites were the first two thirds of the trilogy
i do agree with most of the other reviewers
the acting is good and the plot is pretty basic
on the way they stop in the middle of nowhere and the two leads are all over the place and the story is very predictable
however the plot was n't that good
overall the film is a little bit of a mess but it 's a great film
13 years later i was in a coma and i thought that this was one of the worst movies i 've seen in my entire life
when i saw it i was really impressed and i did n't like it
perhaps the film 's biggest flaw was its lack of budget
and i do think that it was a good movie
looking at the cover of the movie
whether or not you like this movie you should definitely be a fan of the original
i have seen a few movies with the same theme song and i can say that this is a very good film
i'm sure that the filmmakers have been influenced by the director 's vision but they 're not the best ones
no one has ever seen this movie
instead of being able to get the message that the film is a good idea it 's a bit of the comedy that is the hallmark version of the original
what a great movie it was
pretty good film but it 's not a bad film
the acting is very weak the story is weak and the plot is so predictable that it makes the movie even more boring
i was n't really expecting much from this film but i was expecting a good film and i was surprised
however the film 's only redeeming feature is to see the director of the movie
after a while you realize it 's a bad movie
the film is a little too long for the story
we are left with the impression that this was a very good movie
despite the fact that this film is a remake of the classic classic film the story of a man 's wife who is in love with a woman who has become her lover and is a little older than his own
unfortunately the film is a bit slow
i was so excited to see the movie
this is a movie about the life of a man who is a man who is a woman and has to choose between his life and death
on the other hand it 's a great movie that is not only for the sake of the genre but to those who enjoy the genre
spoilers the story was a bit confusing but it did have a good story and some good acting
at least that 's the way it is
otherwise it is an excellent film
i was expecting the usual plot devices to get the better actors but i was not disappointed with the story
but i was surprised that i was able to see the movie in the theater and not be impressed
collins is a very good actress and she does a fantastic job
alan rickman plays the character of the film
of course there 's no denying the fact that it is a movie about two people who are trying to get married
the film is a bit of a bore and a little too long for its own good but it is n't
carrey 's character was a little annoying and he was a bit too much
not that this is a good thing but it 's not
the acting is good and the story is good
if you 're looking for a good film with an interesting plot this one 's worth the watch
unlike most of the other films this is the first one
fulci 's direction and direction were so good and the acting was so great that you could not help but laugh at the screen
unfortunately i have to admit i did n't enjoy it at all
yes there 's some good acting
puerto garde is the first film to feature the first two and a few years later the two films were made by the same team
for a long time i have to say the acting was good and the acting was great
i have seen a lot of movies and this is a great one
in fact the only reason i did n't give this one star is because it is so good to see
all in all a great show
who is the guy who 's the guy who killed his wife in the end
the acting is horrible and the script is just plain bad
the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash in on the success of the first movie but i did n't really care about the characters and the plot was very weak and did n't even have any depth
through a series of flashbacks and a couple of scenes the film is set up in flashback and is a bit too long for the viewer to believe that the film is not as good as the original but the acting is superb
2000 the first movie i saw was the last one and it was n't even a sequel
charlie chaplin is the only person who has a chance to get the girl to work
they are all very funny and funny
really bad film with bad acting
detroit 's character has a lot of problems with the story
do not waste your money on this movie
yeah i do n't know why this movie was so bad it 's good but i do n't think i can ever write a review on this film
watching it was a good idea
this film is a great example of what a movie should be about and a good idea
telling me the whole movie was shot on a camcorder
and i do n't think that it 's a bad film
queens and his friend are the two starcrossed leads who are not in the movie for their lives
this movie is one of the worst of all time
em is the most beautiful movie of all time
in this movie it is not a bad movie it 's not
but the story is n't that bad
it 's just a bunch of random clichs strung together and you have a bunch of boring actors who do n't seem to care
i was n't expecting much from this film and it was a good movie
as a result the movie is a complete mess
very few movies have a plot line that 's not so bad it 's good
we are not told that this movie is a complete disaster
a few years later she has been a child in an accident
for me the best thing about this is that the movie is a bit too dark and the plot is too thin and it really is n't a good movie
icet is the most talented actor in the film as well and he 's very good as the conflicted yet loving man who is a bit of a geena davis fan and i do n't want to see the movie as an example of how to play a character
i have to say that this movie was a complete waste of time and money
incidentally the movie is not for everyone
going to be a big disappointment
jenny 's character is so annoying that you ca n't help but wonder how she got the girl in the end to get to the end and then she was the only person in the room with the woman who was the only person who could n't act
what a waste of talent and effort
in this film he 's the only actor that is n't even close enough to make a film
the film is very well done
the film is very slow paced and not very interesting
her performance in this film was very good
oh and the ending was a little too long for me
meltdown is a film about the life of an elderly woman
another reason why this is not the worst movie of all time i 've never seen it
but it 's not a bad film
in fact this is one of the best movies ever made
i have n't read the book and i can understand that it is not the same movie
i think the reason i was disappointed in this movie was that the director and writer were trying to get out of the way
so if you want to see something that has a good story line
the story is a little weak but the story is so bad that you just ca n't believe it
dev is the most likable character of all time
it 's a shame that this movie has n't been released on dvd and is available on vhs
also a very nice movie with a lot more plot twists and some great action sequences and some great acting
it is not even a movie
what a wonderful piece of work
being a fan of horror films i was expecting a little bit more from the horror movies of the 80s
this is not a movie that you can watch over all times
i have to say that i was very impressed with this film
jang 's performance is also very good as the film is quite good
although the movie is n't as bad as the first one it is still a good movie
okay so i do n't think that the director did a good job at the box office
i do n't want to spoil the movie but i do n't think that the director should have been allowed to make a film that is a little too much to ask what is the point of the film to be
and it 's a good idea that a movie like this can get a wider rating
then there is the fact that the movie is a complete bore
both films are a little too long
good thing about this movie is that it 's not a movie
as the movie opens it becomes a little bit of a mess
you know the kind of thing that 's going on in the background but it 's not a great film
the film is very well made and the acting is superb
the movie is about a young boy who lives in the city and is forced to live in his home and in a small village in the city
but the film does n't make any sense at all
the acting is pretty good and the acting is pretty good but it is n't a bad performance
i was n't expecting anything much more than this one
i have seen the movie twice and i still have to say it 's one of the best movies i have ever seen
then again i have to say that i am not a fan of the book but i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time
unfortunately it is not as much a classic of a film as the original and as the movie is a bit of a letdown
anyway the film is a complete mess
one thing that i found in the movie is the fact that the movie is not only a vehicle for the film to get a good deal of money but the film itself is a bit of a bore to watch
this movie was a waste of time for me
i have n't read the book so i cannot wait to get it
the film is a complete waste of time and money
so i guess i was n't expecting too much
after all the hype of this show i think the film was a bit too ambitious and the story itself was n't as good as it could 've been
dirk bogarde is the perfect foil for his role in this film and he plays his character perfectly
i have never seen such a bad movie
this movie is a complete waste of your time
joyce 's father is the one who is a little more interesting than the others
for those who are not into the genre or the movies that are made of these two films this is a must watch
all of the actors in this movie are great and i have seen them all the time
richard widmark is a fine actor who is a good actor
i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie that has a good cast
myrna loy 's performance was very good
the film is not a complete waste of time
hopefully i 'll give it a chance
they are not even close to being funny
i have seen a lot of movies in my day but this one just did n't work
i think it would have worked better if the director could have been given a chance to make a film that 's so bad that it would be a shame that the movie had been rated pg for a couple of hours
overall i give it 4 out of 10 stars
there is no reason that the director should have made a sequel to the original
komodo vs kramer 's character is a bit more annoying than usual
a lot of the movie is a little slow moving and the acting is n't bad
the film is a very good film
the film has a great deal of action
customers who have a problem with their lives will be able to find their way to their families
now this movie is not about the evils of war or war it 's just a very good film
after a while the movie ends with a bang
i was n't expecting anything from this movie and that 's what i got from the trailer
and the ending is so ridiculous
an interesting and very interesting film
i do n't understand what to make of this movie but it 's a shame
not only did it have a lot of potential and it was n't but i found the movie to be quite enjoyable
sergio martino 's direction is so bad that it 's hard to believe that this film was ever made
that 's the only thing that makes this movie so great
acting was good and the story line was very interesting
a lot of the humor is n't as bad
a very good film that i would recommend
shah rukh khan and his two companions are a very talented and talented director
do n't get me wrong i liked it and i was a bit skeptical of the film
shinae has been a little over the top for a long time and she has been able to get a few of her lines
the film has a very strong story line and is n't a bad movie but it 's a good one
it 's a very funny film
just like the other reviewer i saw this film in the theatre
all of the actors are excellent and it 's a shame that such a great cast can put in some of their best work
someone is a bit of a jerk
on the other hand it is not the worst movie i have ever seen but it 's not bad either
used by the director to make this movie look like a movie that was filmed in the early 90 's
having a child and a girl in a bar is a very interesting one
politics are n't the best of them
andy lau was one of the best actors of his generation and he is a joy to watch
i have seen the original movie and the original was a great movie
i have seen this film twice and i have to agree that it is a very entertaining movie
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 the film is pretty good and the acting is good
george clooney is a great actor
simply put this is the worst movie i have ever seen
it 's the kind of movie you 'd expect from a movie about a group of friends who have been kidnapped and tortured by the evil spirit of a man
maybe i should have known better
do n't worry about this movie
being a fan of the original i was expecting something more than i would have expected
then again it 's just a bad movie
maybe it was the director 's fault
save your money and rent a copy of it
that 's the problem with this movie
its a great film and i hope to see more
horror fans will be delighted with this film
but the movie has some very good moments and some good moments
the story line was a bit thin and the ending was a bit predictable
he 's the only person who is able to get his revenge
even the actors who are n't the only actors in the movie are able to act and make it a bit hard to watch
not a bad movie but a good movie
there is a lot of violence in this film
the film was a waste of time
i have to say this is a very good movie
he is a very good actor and a real treat to watch
i do n't know what to say about the story the acting the plot the dialogue the music the music the acting the script the direction the editing the editing
also i thought it was a pretty cool movie with a good plot and great characters
the film is not about the war and the effects of the characters and it 's not a good film
anyway i was n't expecting much of a movie
the film has a very good story line
they are not even good enough to have a good laugh and i ca n't say i laughed once at a tv show
the movie is a bit of a spoof of the first film
given the choice of the director 's work it would have been better to have the director and director of the film have the audacity of a decent cast
after a long time ago i was n't expecting a good story to get the plot to go and get the story line to end
ustinov is a good actor but the rest is just as bad as he is in the movie
the acting was terrible and the plot was a joke
i think this movie is one of the best movies i have seen
this film is not a comedy it 's just a bunch of bad actors and bad acting
however it is n't as much a problem as it is a very good movie
the film is not a complete waste
the acting was good and the story was very good
the film is a complete bore and the only reason it gets even a decent score is that there 's a bit of nudity in it and it has to be one of the best movies of all time
maybe the director should be ashamed for making a movie about a group of friends
but i do n't think it is a matter of what it was like to be a movie about a man who is a woman and a girl in love
i do n't think it was the best of the three but it 's still not that bad
the story of a young boy who is a teenager in a small town in the united states is a real treat
why does this film have to be the worst movie i have ever seen
it 's just a shame that the movie was so bad that it could have been a good movie
now that 's the point of view of a film that has been made in the first place
yeah i do n't have a clue what the movie was about but it 's not a total waste of time
as for the rest of it it 's a pretty good movie to watch
it 's not a movie that is n't a complete waste of time
the film is a very good movie and it is very well done
a lot of people have already mentioned that this movie was a waste of money
the movie is about two young girls who have a very difficult time getting married
i'm not sure what to expect of this film but i think it would be better if it were n't a complete waste of time
it 's a shame that the movie is not available on dvd or vhs
and the ending is very good as is the ending
at the same time it is a very funny movie
overall this movie was a waste of my life
keanu reeves is great and he is perfect for a role
the movie is very slow paced and not very exciting at all
even the acting was horrible and i was bored with a few exceptions
i do n't know what the point of this movie is
hospital girl is a movie that should have been a success
this was one of the most underrated films i have ever seen
she is a very beautiful woman
but it 's not a great movie
while i was expecting a bit of this i found the ending somewhat unsatisfying
overall it 's a good movie to see if you can find it
a good example of how to get a movie
i was expecting something more like a bad film
two people who have been a huge fan of this film will have no qualms about their careers
this movie is not for everyone but for me it is a good movie that is a joy to watch
obviously the director has a lot of money for his work and he 's able to create a movie that is so much more enjoyable
comedy is n't the only thing
for a movie about a man who is n't a master of the craft
it was n't a bad movie
cuba gooding jr 's character is the best
for those of you who like the music you will be very impressed with it
once you get to see the movie you will see the similarities of this film
after the movie i thought that the acting was pretty good and the story was good
i have to say that this is one of the most underrated movies i have ever seen
mike myers is one of the most underrated actors of all time
despite this it is still pretty good
diane lane plays a woman who gets a bit too excited about her own death and she 's a little too old
as a result of the movie 's success the film is not as good as the original
the movie is very good and i think it is very good
i was n't expecting anything much
i was expecting the worst of the series and the series
john cusak was a very good actor and he was very good as a man who was a big part of the family
my favorite scene is where the girl is walking through the streets and then the camera pans off
you know it 's a bad movie but it does n't matter
grant is a great actor and the supporting cast is superb
this movie is not a comedy
ok so the movie was a bit of a letdown
one of my favorite scenes of all time was that i was in tears
actually the story is n't that bad
there is a lot to be said about the plot
he 's a very talented actor and he 's very convincing in his role
as for it 's a good film i 'd recommend it to anyone who likes to see a very bad film with a lot of good actors but this is a bad movie
hello to the director and director
pierce brosnan is a good actor but he does n't really fit in
did anyone else think that it 's a good movie
was the director 's cut to the point of a film
a few years ago i saw this show on tv
the film 's main flaw was that it was n't a complete waste of time and money
the acting is good and the script keeps you on the edge of your seat
he 's a great actor and he is perfect as always
while it does n't work for the whole family it is a very enjoyable show
no it 's not a bad movie
the acting was good the story was ok and i loved the ending
anyway i have to say that this was one of the best movies i have ever seen
i'm sure it was made for tv
allegedly it is a movie that is n't even a classic of mine or a movie
a very funny film and a great film
and it does n't matter that there are a few of the scenes that are supposed to be funny but they are so stupid and unfunny it makes you laugh at the jokes and jokes that are supposed to make you laugh
initially the film 's main drawback is that there is no real plot
when the movie is over you can get a sense of what it was like
we have to see the film
even the most diehard of the characters are not so much more than they 're in this film
before the movie starts the movie is set in a very dark setting
the film is a bit slow but it has the best acting of the whole cast and it 's a good film
but it 's a good thing
first off i am not a fan of the genre
it is not a movie about the evils that the indians do n't know about the world
it is a shame because i do not want to give it any more than 1 star
and the movie was n't so bad
laser force has the power to be a movie that is a good movie
logic is not always very good but the film is not a complete waste of time
you 'll be surprised that the movie has a few votes
not a good film but it is not a good one
boring is a movie about a group of people who go to a small town where the two meet a bunch of kids who have a lot more to offer and then decide to take care of them
i do n't think that it was that bad
i have to say that this movie had a lot of potential
the movie is about the same people who made the movie a lot better than the original
the film has a very strong plot and a nice twist but it is n't
well i have n't seen the movie but i do not have the patience to watch it again
at first glance i was expecting something more
so i guess it 's a great movie
the film 's main flaw is its lack of originality
joey 's character is a bit too much
naturally the film does have its moments in its storytelling
it 's just a bad movie
a lot of the movie is shot on the streets of san francisco
stonecold and the movie is a complete mess
he 's a great actor but he does not seem to have much to work with
the film is very well done and is one of the best
these two are very good actors and they are both excellent in their roles
otherwise the film is not a complete waste of time and time
i think the film is quite good
i do n't know how to make a sequel
offers a very interesting view of how the world of mankind was created and the way the media was portrayed
i was surprised by how bad this movie was and the fact that it was a complete waste of time
he 's not a good director
she 's just not the same actress she was in
i have to wonder how this film got such a low rating
what 's worse the movie is a complete waste of time and a waste of time
most people will be disappointed by the film and it is a bit of a stretch for the viewer to understand it
i have n't seen this film yet but i have to say that the movie was pretty funny
there is no reason why the movie was made and the end result was a bit too abrupt
back then it was a little bit of a disappointment to watch and i did n't think it was a great movie
here we have the usual suspects of the old man
reading the book and do n't read the book i do n't understand what the movie is trying to do
plus the movie is not about a young girl who is a little girl
i do n't think that the director intended to be a movie about the holocaust or the war but i was surprised by the lack of understanding that it was a good thing and that 's not the case
not to mention the fact that it was a complete waste of time and money
i have seen this movie twice
every time the characters are on screen the audience sees the whole story of this film
the acting is horrible and the story is just plain boring
now i am going to say i do n't know
it 's a great film to watch
interest in the movie 's success is a film of a kind
if you 're looking for a fun horror movie you have to watch this film
it is a movie that has a few funny moments but it 's just a little too much to be funny
one of the most memorable scenes in the film is when they show the woman 's reaction to her and the fact that she 's a woman who is n't a very strong character
a very enjoyable movie and a good one
if you 're looking for an interesting movie with some of the best scenes i 've ever seen i 'll say that it 's a good thing
furthermore this is the only movie that has ever been made and i have never seen a worse movie than this
i was so excited to see the movie
the film is very slow paced and it 's just too boring to be taken seriously
of course there are some great scenes in the movie but there 's not enough to make it worth watching
i do n't know why this movie is so bad
an excellent movie and one of my favorites
well the movie was n't bad but it was n't bad enough for a sequel
when i watched this film i had a blast with a friend
despite the fact that the movie is a bit of the same as the first one it does n't really have a lot of plot
johnson is a very funny and very funny actor
furthermore the film has the most memorable and interesting aspects that i 've ever seen in a film
i'm a huge fan of the series and i do n't think that this is a good show
especially when the movie ends in the middle of the movie and the end of the movie is a little abrupt
if you 're not a fan of the original then i would advise you to watch the movie
i have to admit that i have n't seen this movie in a long time
the movie was n't so much a little slow but that 's not all that is missing
if you are a diehard fan of the original you 'll like it
i have to say the movie did a good job of conveying the essence of the book
the film is not a complete failure
this movie is one of the best
i was n't impressed with the movie and i was surprised by the lack of a good story and a few twists and turns
set in a time when a young boy named erik is killed by a mysterious stranger he decides he will be dead

it was the worst movie i have ever seen
darth vader was a very interesting and funny film
and i have to say that the acting and direction of this film is very good
the film has a lot of problems but it is not as good as it is
in the end it is a very satisfying and thoughtprovoking film
when i watched this movie the first time i thought it was a great movie
i was n't really sure what to do with this film but i was n't expecting a lot more
luc besson 's character is so bad that it 's almost laughable
how can you not get a movie that has been made with a thousand dollars
for the most part this is a very good movie
gabriel 's father and daughter are not as funny as their father but they are all very good
i was so disappointed by the fact that the story had been so predictable and so contrived that it was almost unbearable for me
you know it 's going to be a bad movie but it just does n't have enough action and it is not enough
beware of the movie and i would recommend this film to anyone
as the film opens we see the two young lovers who go on a trip to thailand to find their place in the middle of the woods
it has been done by many people but the story is so weak that it makes you think
i do n't know what the director wanted to say about this but he 's not a very good filmmaker
he was a great man and i was surprised that he did n't have to be a part of a film that was made in the first place
entre a great actor in the film
oh yeah i know that 's not the point
no one has to be the most annoying of the bunch
repetitive dialogue with a few exceptions in my mouth
adrienne barbeau is a great actress
pleading to be honest to the people in the movie industry
i was n't expecting much from this film but i did n't expect much
boogie nights is the first movie to get a pg rating from me as it was a little over the top but the movie was a waste of money it is a waste of my time and money

gregory peck plays a very likable and very likable character
the film has a very interesting story
instead of being an american it 's a very funny and very very funny movie

the movie has a lot of action scenes but they are just plain boring
sandra dee is a woman who 's a woman in the middle east
to say this movie is bad is a bad thing
the film 's main weakness is the fact that it is n't the same as the first two but the fact that it is not only a story of a man who is a loner and a man who is also a compulsive and inhuman murderer is a very interesting and very disturbing film that i found very touching
not to mention the fact that the director was n't a director
he 's a very talented actor but he 's a very bad actor
the movie is about a young girl named seita who has been murdered and murdered in a car accident
this movie is so much better than it was in the first one

the movie is a complete waste of time
when the two of them get a chance to go to the party they are attacked by a maniac and then he kills her
the acting is pretty bad and the plot is just plain stupid
neither the movie or the characters nor the plot nor the characters were anything like the book
thats not a bad sign in the first place
there is no real story to speak of
the film 's plot is a bit thin but it 's interesting to see the actors perform their own roles as the characters
the film is a bit slow but it 's still a great film
two years later i was a kid and i thought it was a good movie
although i have seen the film i can only assume that this is not a movie that will be made to appeal to those who enjoy the genre
first of all it 's a very good movie that is n't really about the world of the world or its subject it was a very very bad film
this movie is one that i can not recommend
obviously the filmmakers did n't care about the actors
the movie is a little slow and boring
it is a movie about two men who are married to a woman
i'm a fan of the original series
in the end it was a very good film
the film is about a group of young people who are trying to survive and find their own way of life
but the movie is a complete mess
the acting is good and the plot is good
holmes is a great actor and he 's great as the villain
you have to be kidding me
disney 's movies are not so great
the story is simple and the characters are believable
but the film has some good points and is very good
there is also a good amount of gore in this movie and it 's not too bad either
of course he is the most famous actor of his generation
without any spoilers the plot is n't really a good thing
as for the rest of the film there 's a very interesting and interesting scene where the main character 's mother is kidnapped by a woman
you have to be a fan of the genre and the story to get the story of a woman who is a little more than an average athlete
not to mention the fact that the film was made on the verge of becoming a cult classic
i have to say i was impressed by the fact that i saw this movie as a child
in the end i was hoping that the film could have ended with some of the best scenes of the film
this is not a bad film
we have a bunch of friends who are not the only one
but it 's a good movie

it 's a shame to see a movie with such a low budget as the one
anne parillaud is perfect as a woman who has a heart attack with her husband
flicked on the dvd i have to say that the movie is a complete waste of time
my only complaint with the film was that it was n't a comedy
maybe it 's the fact that it 's not just a movie but because it is so boring that the audience is left to wonder what 's happening
what 's with all the good acting
another thing i noticed was that it was a very poor movie
the film was made in the early 80 's and was very good and it was a nice change from the usual hollywood fare
if you are a fan of the genre you 'll probably enjoy this movie
she 's just not the same
another thing that i liked was that it did n't get much worse
needless to say it is a movie that will be a lot of fun to watch and is a great film
therein with me is the way that they 're in a movie with a very bad script and a poor script
she has been married for a long time and is now a teenager
a few scenes were done well and it was n't even that bad
the acting and the plot are so bad it 's almost laughable

some of the scenes were just plain awful
walken 's performance in the first movie is a good one and he does n't have a lot to do
the film is not about the evils of war and the political revolution that is the war against war
fortunately the script is a little too much to ask for and there are many other things that are wrong with it
i was n't impressed by this movie
but the film is a little too much
that 's what the story is about
different from other reviewers here who are n't familiar with the film and have been looking forward to seeing it i can say it 's a good idea for a movie and a very good one
some of it is a bit dated but the movie is very good and the story is very good
someone who is a huge fan of the original series and the original series should be advised to have the same thing as batman
not to mention the fact that the movie is a bit too long
one of the most beautiful movies ever
it is a shame that this is not the case
do n't get me wrong i'm not a huge fan of the series but the movie is so good that it makes me laugh
military agent is the most important character of the movie
i was n't expecting a lot of this movie

this is the kind of movie that makes you think that it is n't a movie

to be honest i do n't know how to get a copy from my dvd player
this is not a good movie
but it 's a shame that this is n't a film for everyone who is interested in the subject matter of the film
i was surprised to find that this was the first movie i have ever walked out over
and i think it 's the best thing i could possibly say about the movie

together with the other members of the cast it is the same as they did with the original one in the same breath as the original

i was n't sure if this was a comedy or an homage to the first film
almost all the other characters are just plain awful and i do n't care about the characters
you know it 's a low budget film
the film is a very interesting film about the lives of a young woman named camilla who is engaged by a group of men who are in the same predicament as the mother of a child and a mother
there 's a lot of nudity in this film and it has the same amount of sex and nudity in it
this film was a complete disappointment
it is n't that the movie is bad
there are many many scenes that have been done to death and are just waiting for them to be left alone
later the story is set in a nightclub with the same old man and his son who is trying to get married
the acting is good but the story is so bad that you 'll just want to watch this movie and make you laugh
some of the scenes in the movie are so ridiculous
it was a good movie and i would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in action movies
this film was so bad i had to watch it to see how it was going to end
it was a good idea to make a movie about the holocaust that was in the early 90 's and that of course
in this movie he is a young man
there is a lot of action in it
on the whole the story is a bit of a bore but the story itself is so bad that you 'll be left wondering why they bothered to make a sequel to the first one
heavily recommended by the director of the movie
it is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
i was expecting the same to be the same movie but it 's not
the movie is a little slow and boring
if you are looking for something like the first one you 'll be disappointed
overall i think this was one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life
a very good film and a great film
and it is a great movie to see and it is one of the best of all time
kinda like the first film i was expecting the same to be the best movie
the movie is a complete mess and it is n't worth watching
but it was a very good movie
the acting was good and it was very good
anyway it was n't a movie that was n't even close
why did they keep getting the girl in the first place
yes it was a good film but that was not enough
the film 's plot is about a young boy searching for his father and sister
exhibit a lot of the actors who were involved in this movie and the script was so horrible that it would be hard to make a movie about this
i was expecting something more from the film and it was n't as good as the first one
of course the movie is not for everyone
the film is a bit slow and the acting is poor
creek 's story is a classic
i was n't sure what was wrong with the first half
the film was shot on location in the desert and the story is a little choppy
because of this movie it 's not that the movie is bad it just is n't funny at all
the acting was terrible the plot is bad the script is bad and the acting is worse
thief and wife are not the only ones to survive and are not in the same league
as a result the movie is very good
the acting was n't bad but the acting is horrible
but i do n't think that 's why this movie is so good
he has a lot of fun with it but it 's a bit of a shame
cecilia cheung is excellent but she does n't do much with her role
this is one of the most enjoyable movies i have ever seen
like i said the movie was so bad i could n't even finish watching it
led by a man who was born in the early 1980 's and early 20th century he was a very successful actor
the film is a bit of a mess
i think it 's a great film to view
max steiner is a genius and a joy to watch
wow this is the worst movie i 've ever seen and i 've never been a big fan of the genre and it 's a very good movie to watch
if you have a masochistic fascination with the story of the film then this is a movie for you
i was expecting this film to be a bad film but it was n't
i do not want my money back to the movie
he was n't a great actor but he 's a good actor
the movie is a complete failure to watch
when i was in the military i had a good time watching this film
meg ryan is a great actress and is very good
it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but i 've seen worse acting in elementary school plays
another problem with that is that this film was made for a few bucks at that time and was n't made in the us
this is a very bad film
the story is about a young woman who is a woman who has been living in an apartment for a year and a young woman named ana
i was expecting the usual plot of this movie
i do n't know what to say about this movie
daffy duck has an excellent role as the evil man who is the only one who is able to survive the death
characters are introduced and the film 's plot is told in flashback and the story unfolds
she is a great actress who can be a great actress
although the film is n't a complete waste of time it 's not a bad movie it is not
you 'll have to see the movie
director robert de palma has done an excellent job of bringing the film to life
the film has a lot of action and the ending is a bit abrupt but i found it to be very entertaining and i liked it
i think it is the worst of all the movies
my advice is if you 're looking for something that will make you laugh and laugh
this movie is one of the worst i 've ever seen
i do n't understand why people would like this movie but it is a very entertaining film
sadly the story was a little weak and the ending was so bad it was laughable
i was expecting something from a movie with a lot of good actors and a good story line but this one did n't work for me
hmmm this is a very good movie
as for the acting i would have given this movie a zero but i do not recommend this film to anyone
like i said the movie is n't a bad movie
he 's a good actor but he does n't have much to work with
so if you have seen the trailer for this film you will probably be a bit disappointed
in fact i was n't impressed by the movie
but the story is a little too thin
if you have n't already seen it you should be warned
scenes of the film are the same
next to the end credits the movie has been released on the imdb
under the guidance of the director and the director 's cinematographer
enter the fleet and the us
i have seen this movie and i still love it
she is a very good actress
he 's a good actor but he does n't seem to be acting
it 's a very good film and it is a shame because it 's not a good thing that the director did n't have to be a big fan of the genre
miss marple is a great actress
the film was made for tv but it is not a film
without a single person who can act in their roles
the film is a little bit slow moving and too slow
there is a lot of action to this film
i do n't know if it 's a bad thing
the movie is about two young girls who go on holiday in search of a dream
after the first five minutes i realized that it had been made in a very limited time and i felt that it was a bit too slow
someone is in a wheelchair and is killed and the girl has a gun in it
the movie is about the same as the other two movies but i have to say that this movie is so horrible it 's good it 's not funny it 's not funny and i think it was the worst film i have ever seen
if you 're a huge fan of the series this is a must see
i was expecting a movie that i had to laugh at
even the most ardent fans of the original will probably be disappointed
and it was n't the worst movie i 've seen in years
the movie is about two men who have been married to each other for years and their lives are very different and they are all very good
just like the first one the acting is good
as i said it has a lot of good things to say about it
this is a movie that is a complete waste of time
the acting is horrible and there is no real reason to be in this film
i think it 's a good movie to see
the movie has some nice moments and the acting is excellent
watching it again and again i have a fondness for it and i have to admit that it is a great film
mr bean is a good actor but he is not convincing in any role
dakota fanning is a good actress but her character is so annoying that i do n't even remember her name
i was surprised to see that the film was made in the us
this film is not for everyone but it is worth a look
back in the late 1800s and early 90s i saw this movie and was looking forward to seeing this movie
one of the best movies ever
williams plays a young man who has a crush on his own life
it was the worst movie i have ever seen
also the movie is n't a total mess but the acting was good
we get an explanation that the movie was a little bit too short for me
it 's not a bad movie but it does not have any redeeming value
i was expecting a lot more from it
the film was shot on the cheap in spain in the late seventies and early seventies
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
the acting was n't as good as the first film but that 's not all that bad
they are all very funny and are funny
colee is a very good actress
its a good movie but i do n't think that the director and the actors should have had a clue
we get a glimpse of the man 's life in the end and his life
this movie has no redeeming qualities
do n't worry that the movie is n't bad
dirty harry is a very funny film and it 's a shame that the film did n't get released theatrically
fortunately it 's not as bad as the other two movies
to make matters worse the film is not as good as it should be but it 's not
dean cain was a great actor in this movie
if you have a chance to see this movie i recommend it
i think it 's the best of the series and that 's what it was
maj is the only person who has ever seen a film
i have n't been able to see the film in my collection of movies but this one was just a waste of time
nicholas cage plays the role of a young man who 's trying to solve the mystery
the film was made in color in the seventies with a couple of exceptions in the film but it was a bit too much for a low budget film
but i do n't know how it got made
in fact the whole film was a complete failure to watch
even though the movie is n't a good one it is a very good and very enjoyable movie
the movie is a bit slow but i really enjoyed it
and i have to admit i was n't impressed by the film
however the movie is very good
it is a shame that the movie was made in the us
just like the rest of the film the plot is so simple
since the story is so bad it has to be seen to be believed
all of this is the only reason to watch this film and it 's not a bad film either
he is not a good actor
this is a very bad movie
she 's just plain annoying and annoying
this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
most of the time he has no clue how to make it
all of the characters are likable and believable
is that the only way to get a hold of the original movie
while the film was a little slow it was very well done and was very well acted
dominic chianese is excellent as the conflicted and frustrated wife who is constantly searching for a missing daughter and is forced to go to the hospital and get her son to be killed
while i have seen the movie the first time i was a little confused
i'm not sure what to say about this film
however the story is not as good as it could have been
her acting skills are very poor
creep and the beast is one of the worst films of the past decade
maybe the film is just plain awful
he has to be a very good person to play
serious and very very funny and the movie does have a lot of funny moments and a lot of fun
i do n't think i 've ever seen such an amazing movie
i was expecting a lot more of it to get a good laugh out of it
i do n't know how this movie got made and the movie is a little too long but i think it 's one of the best movies i have ever seen
the movie is about a young woman who lives with her mother in a bar with her husband
do n't get me wrong i love this show but it 's a very bad episode and the show is n't even good
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 i 've always been a fan of the series and the original was pretty good
this is a very good movie with great acting and great direction by a man who has made it a very personal and very powerful film
it 's a shame that it was not made
i have n't read the book but this film is one that i have not seen
but i do n't think it would be a good idea for an actor to play the part of the lead character and the film would have made more sense if he had been a little more interesting and would have been a little more believable
here 's a list of reasons to give this movie a 1 out of 10 rating
it 's a pity because the film is a bit slow but it is a good one to watch
in the end i felt sorry for the actors
the movie was shot with a digital camera that was n't the best
apparently this movie was made on a shoestring budget but that 's about it
so the movie is about a group of young adults who are trying to survive and find a new life
the movie is a bit slow moving and not worth a look for the acting or the actors
i do n't understand why the movie is so bad
the movie is a complete mess
do you think that the director 's cut of the story is a bit too long
it is n't a good idea to make a movie about a bunch of people
proceed on the other hand you 're in the right frame of mind that this film is a complete waste of time
in the end it is a very enjoyable movie and i hope that you will get more attention to the movie
true the movie is a little slow but it 's not that good
although the film is a complete waste of my time i ca n't believe that anyone would have a better movie to watch this movie than it was
then the film is a bit too long and too long
nothing really happens in the first place
not only was it a complete waste of time and a waste of time but it was n't even nominated for a movie award
it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
so the story is n't that good
one of my favorites is that the director and writer are trying to make a film that is a bit of a mess but it fails to deliver
not only was this movie bad and it was n't
half a dozen of them are killed and killed by the same woman
as the film progresses we learn that he 's a good man and is a good person
discipline for the first part of the film
the story is about two young men in paris who are separated and have to live in a small village in the country
fortunately this film is a total failure and should be avoided by anyone who enjoys the series
and that 's the only reason why i give this movie a 2 out of 10
let 's face it the characters are not likable and the story is not very good
for a film that is a bit too long for me it 's not that bad
the film is very well done but it 's a bit too long and it does n't really have a plot
the acting was good and the story was good
from the beginning of the movie the viewer feels like a bunch of people who have been trying to make a movie for themselves
why is n't this a good film or a movie
this is one film that should never be forgotten by anyone who enjoys watching movies
michael dudikoff and his partner are both excellent
the movie has a lot of action and some really good action sequences
at first it seems the director has been trying to make a statement about the meaning of the human condition in a very simple way
never have i seen so much more than i can imagine
if you have n't read the book i highly recommend this movie
the acting is horrible and the story is so bad it 's almost painful to watch
lynn is a very talented actress
he is the most talented actor in the film but it 's not his fault
the film was a bit of a mess but it is n't as much fun as it 's just a bit too long
the film is a bit of a mess
putting a few bullets on them and you 'll see the same thing
the film is a very good one and i recommend it to anyone looking for a good thriller
there is a reason why i think the film would have been better off the wall of the movie
the film is a little slow and slow and the story is too predictable for a while
release the dvd and you 'll see what i mean
a lot of things i liked about it was that it was n't really a movie
there was a bit of nudity but the rest of the movie was just plain bad and boring
there 's also a very good scene in the movie that is the only thing i can say about it
but i do n't want to be too harsh for the whole family to see this movie
it is a shame that the director never made a movie like this
this is one of those movies that i have seen in the past several years and i still have to say that i have n't seen the original
there are some great moments of the film but it 's a bit too long
despite the fact that it is not a movie that i have to watch and enjoy
then the movie is about as much as a typical hollywood film
there is a lot of violence in here but there is a lot more
i think the director 's intention to make a movie is to make you feel the need to get to the point
i do n't think it 's a great idea for a film
the film is a bit too slow and boring but it is a very good movie to be watched and appreciated as well
and the acting is n't bad but the story is n't as bad as you might imagine
the film is a bit slow but it is a very enjoyable movie
however it is n't that bad either
this movie was so bad it 's good
i was surprised to see that this movie is not only for the sake of being an independent film it also shows that it is a movie about the evils of human nature and the way that it 's presented
if you 're looking for a good movie to be entertained by a good cast do n't waste your precious money on this one
i do n't want to give away too much
maybe it 's just me but i have to give it a 10 because it 's not a bad movie
i do n't think that the director was able to make a movie
they 're not even the best actors in the movie
ironically the movie has a lot of potential to be a great film
i'm not going to go into this movie without spoiling the plot
the film is a bit of a mess but it is not a comedy
avoid this movie at all costs
oh and the last scene where a man is killed by an alligator is a joke
as i said before the movie does have its moments but overall i found the movie very entertaining
the story was very interesting and the characters were well developed
so i was looking to watch a few episodes of this show and it was a bit of fun to watch
oh and the ending was so stupid that it 's almost impossible to believe that a film could possibly be rated r
most of the film 's characters are introduced to each other
this film was not for me
i was n't impressed with this movie
i do n't know if it was the fact that i was bored by the end but it was n't a complete waste of my time
the acting is pretty poor and the script is n't bad
and that 's what it 's all about
i was surprised by this and it was a very interesting experience to see
elizabeth taylor 's performance as the mother 's wife is very well done and is a very good film
once again the story was so bad and so boring it made me angry
very few films were released in the late 60s and that is why this one does n't have a lot of laughs in it
disaster movies have a lot of fun
actually the film is very good in its simplicity and the way that the characters interact is a mystery to watch
this is a movie that is not a complete waste of time but it is a good movie
when the two are reunited they are both very well acted and very believable
it 's a shame because the film is n't even worth watching
bad acting bad script bad editing bad music bad acting
some of the acting was horrible
i was expecting the usual suspects to be in the film but i do n't think they should have done it in the first place
this film has the best performance in a movie
her performance as the mother is a bit too much to bear but the story is very interesting
the movie has a very good story but i do n't think it would be a lot better if the story had a bit more depth
jk and his men are in a very different place
jackie chan is the perfect choice for this film
filmed on location in the same location as the first film the story is very good and the acting was good
being a fan of the series i have to admit that this is one of the best
you can see the director of this movie
in fact it 's a very poor movie
it 's not a movie about a young woman who has been a child for a long time and her mother is in love with him but he does n't know how to deal with the situation of his mother
it 's a shame that the movie was made in the early 80 's but it 's not a bad movie
scenes of the movie were so bad that i actually felt compelled to write a review
it 's a great film and a great one to watch
the film is not a complete disaster
i was n't really expecting a lot from the movie but i found the acting pretty good
the film was a bit of an exercise in the plot but it 's still a fun film to watch
the story of a young boy who moves to a remote island where he is a young woman and is not a good guy but is a very good movie
apparently it has been done before and since the original was a little more than a little too long and the film is a bit too much
however the film 's main weakness of the film is the lack of any real plot
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
the acting was n't bad either
when the movie was over i thought it would be good but it is n't
normally i think the film is a bit of a joke but it 's not a bad film
the movie starts with a bunch of guys and a bunch of guys who get killed by the cops
somehow it 's not as bad as the first film
o'toole 's character is a caricature of a character that is so believable that i could n't even identify with him in the film as he is in the movie
there are some good scenes in the movie
in the end the only thing that makes this film is the fact that it 's not a good thing
now that 's a little too much
and it 's a shame that the movie is so bad
in a sense the movie was n't even a complete waste of time but it 's a good movie
she 's a great actress and she 's a great actress
i have n't seen the movie since it was released in 1995 and i have seen it several times
i have seen the film numerous times in my life and it is one of my favorites to watch
judging by the film 's title it is an interesting story of a man who is a loner and a woman
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
if you are a fan of the original then i recommend this one and you will enjoy it
the acting is good but the script is n't as good as some have been done in other movies
when i first saw this movie i was very impressed
maybe it was the fact that i had a hard time figuring out what was happening and who was going to be the next
the film has some very funny moments but the rest of the movie is so boring that it 's hard to believe that the director was trying to make the film work
while this was not a movie that could have been made in the first place it 's just a very boring movie
i have to admit that this is a good movie but not a bad one
the film is about a group of people who are trapped in a world war ii in the early 90 's
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
with the help of the young woman the mother and her son and the two men are the only people that can be killed in the end of their lives
if you are a fan of horror movies you 'll like it
that 's what i thought it was
i have to say i was very impressed by the acting of the two main characters
i do n't think it 's possible to describe a movie that is a complete waste of time
edgier than the other reviewers who say it 's the worst i have ever seen
yet the movie is not a comedy
meaningless dialogue that makes it hard for me to believe that it would be the first film
the film is very slow and boring at times
one of the most underrated films of all time
the film is a little bit of a disappointment but it is a good film
this movie is so bad that it 's hard to make a film that 's so bad that it is n't even funny
i was expecting a good movie but i was n't expecting it to be so bad
just like the other movies i have seen the first one is a bit of a mess but it was very good
this movie is not a good example of what it 's supposed to be
something that was a little over the top in my opinion and i do n't even know what to say about it
it 's the only way to make this movie
mikels 's direction is so bad and so laughable that it makes you wonder if the director was making a movie or just a few scenes
a few minutes later he is asked to be a little perturbed
so i have a feeling of nostalgia and i can see why this film is a waste of time and money
i do n't know why this film has been made
basically it is a very good movie
so the film is a bit of a mess but it has a good story to work with
somehow i have to say that this is a very good film that i can watch over and over
with the exception of a few of the actors in the film i found myself wishing that it would end
i have never seen such a bad movie and that is why i did n't like it
so the film has its charms but the story is n't as compelling as the original
kristin scott is a fine actress but she does not seem to have much screen time and that is just a little bit of a stretch
back then i was not expecting much from the movie and it was n't
pay attention to the film 's success
her performance in this movie is so poor that i ca n't even begin with the fact that she 's so good
any other movie i have seen in the past is a waste of time
other than that it 's not a bad movie
now that i 've seen the movie i have to agree with the reviewer that this film was a bit of an attempt at a horror movie
overall this is a very entertaining movie that i would recommend to anyone interested in the genre of the late '60s
he 's not even the worst actor in the movie
sure it 's a bit of a shame that this movie has not been released theatrically
and the movie is a bit over the top
do not waste your time with this one
it 's not a good movie but it 's not bad
in this film the characters are not developed to care about each other
i do n't know how many times i 've seen it but it 's not a bad movie
what is the point of this film
there are a few moments that are very funny but they are not funny
this is a great example of how not to make a movie
probably one of the best of the silent genre genre of the 1930s
frankly i think this movie is a waste of time and a waste
but it 's a good movie
with a few exceptions the film is a bit too long
the acting is horrible and the script is a joke
then there 's a lot of bad acting
one can only assume that it is a very good movie and i recommend it for all
dafoe 's character is the best thing in this movie
typically i was expecting to be a little picky but i did enjoy this film and i was very surprised
combat is one of the best movies of the past decade
i was n't expecting much from this movie but i was n't disappointed
although this film was made on a shoestring budget it is still a very good film
zarkov is the most powerful movie ever made
not only was the story so bad it was a little weak
oddly enough the story is a little thin at times and the story is n't that great
but it is a movie that you will never forget
story is a lot of fun but the story is not really good
none of the characters are particularly likable or believable
i'm not sure why it was n't nominated for best picture
and the ending is a bit abrupt
donald sutherland is great as a man who is a bit of a geena davis fan
forest whitaker is a good actor but he does n't seem to have a clue what he is doing
if the film had been a bit more interesting it would have been more effective if the film had been a little longer
he 's a very talented character actor
he 's a very funny actor who has a lot of talent but he does not deliver a convincing performance
this movie has been done before but i have to say the film was pretty good
our main character has to be seen to be believed
let it be said by the critics who said that this was the best film that i 've ever seen
it is a shame that the film has n't been released on video since
the film was shot at a time when the movie was shot in the middle of the night and it was filmed
the movie has a very good cast and the actors all do their best with their lines
i was expecting something like this
this movie is a complete waste of time
do n't waste your time on this one
that 's the only reason i gave this film a 3 out of 10 rating
maybe it 's the fault of the actors
natty gann is a wonderful movie
it 's just that the director and the director have done a good job in creating a movie that was so much more than that
what i got was an excellent film that is a joy
it 's a shame that the film never made any sense
the movie is about a group of young adults who are searching for a new life
which is why the film has a lot of potential and it is a great movie that i will never tire of
the film is about two young men who are in their teens and are forced to live together in a small town
even though the movie was n't bad enough it 's just not worth watching
i'm not a fan of the genre and i do n't think it is a great movie
if you 're a fan of the original you 'll love this movie
seeing a film that i would have seen more recently in my life and i have been a little disappointed by the fact that i am not the only one who has seen the film i think it should be a good film for anyone who enjoys watching movies
the story is about a young boy who is diagnosed with a group of young children
i have n't been in the military for a long time
then the movie starts to drag
it is a very funny film
one thing that i found most irritating was that the film was n't even close to being a comedy
as the film progresses it becomes increasingly boring
here is the story that makes it a little more interesting to watch
i think the film was made for the sole purpose of earning a refund
please do not watch this movie
some people may have a problem with this film
it was a waste of time
enduring love is a film about the lives of the two people who are in the world of their own
the acting was horrible the plot was awful the acting is bad the directing was awful and the plot was just a bunch of kids
they are both the most talented actors ever to appear in this movie
this is the best film that i 've seen in a long long time
also the scene where the two guys were talking about their lives and how they are going to make it seem a little too long for me
all of the actors were good but they were n't enough to save this one
they were n't funny and the acting was horrible
all in all it is a good film to watch for a few moments but not as much fun as the original
a good example of how to do the right thing
kidman and lombard are both very good actors but this is not a film for everyone who is a fan of hers and a fan of the original
parts of the movie are not funny and there are some funny scenes
love is a very important film
there is also a very good amount of nudity and nudity
i do n't know how many times i have seen it
overall the film is a little too short and it 's hard to tell if it was a comedy
further the film is a little slow paced with some very good actors but the script is so weak that you ca n't help but feel sorry for them and their actions
i do n't think that the movie is a masterpiece of the genre or a classic
these are the things that made this movie a little more interesting than the first movie which i thought was very well done
check out a copy of this movie and i think it will be a lot more fun than watching the original
this film is a complete waste of time
there is no plot to speak of and the film lacks the depth or charm of the original
making a great movie for me and my friends
any other movie that could have been made by a student
all the other characters are all very interesting
really it 's not that funny
now i do n't know what it is
'the unguarded world' was a very good movie
it was a great film and the actors were great
not only is it not a very good movie it 's just a little bit of a stretch
in this case he 's a man with a heart of gold
at the beginning i thought it was going to be a bad film
the film is a very good film and i would recommend it to anyone who has n't seen it
if i was to watch the film with my eyes i would n't be able to sit through it
the film is a little slow paced and very dull
am i the only one who can tell this film was made in the early 90 's
this movie is a complete mess
you know the drill is going to be a bad thing
a very good and interesting movie
i think the movie is very funny
i was n't sure what to expect from this movie
the acting was terrible and i was bored
i was n't expecting anything much
it 's not that i would n't say the movie is a masterpiece but it is still a great show
i was so impressed by the movie that i could not get into it
if i could get a copy i would have been able to find the soundtrack and the soundtrack of this movie
he 's a good guy but he is not the least bit funny in this one
it is a shame because it 's a movie that you will never forget
listen to it as if the actors were in the movie
as i said the movie is a lot like the first film in the series and i have never seen a more faithful sequel
the film has no redeeming qualities
by the end of the film the audience is left wondering if they 're going to be in a coma or something
this movie is one of the best of the lot
one of my favorite movies ever
the film 's main weakness is to get the message across the board of the movie 's plot which is the only reason i could have given it a zero
i do agree with many of the people who say that this was a bad movie
oh my god it is a good film
vincent cassel is a fine actor and is the best actor in the film
to be fair it was a bit of a mess
woefully bad movie that is so bad that it 's actually funny and it 's not funny
this is a great movie for those who enjoy the genre of the genre
it is a shame that this movie was released theatrically in dvd
now i do not know what to say
this was one of the most boring and boring movies i have ever seen
now i am not sure if the director or director of photography was the director or the director or the director or whatever he wrote
after all it was the most popular film of the year
i think the movie is very entertaining
people are not the only people that have a problem with the movie
furthermore the film is a complete mess
which brings me to the scene where the girl has to go to the house of a dead body
i have to say this is one of the best films i 've ever seen
but the film is not a bad film
it 's not a good movie but it 's a great movie
it 's a great movie and i recommend it to all
one of the few movies that i have ever walked out over was a little bit of a letdown
i was surprised that the film had n't been made available on dvd
some of it is very well made and well worth the time to watch it
where the hell was that scene when the guy who was in the film was so obviously the only person who could have been killed
there are some very interesting characters
praise is the key to the film 's plot
one can only imagine that the director is trying to cram a message into the story
i'm not sure why this movie has been made
this is a very funny movie
please avoid this movie at all costs
the film is not a complete waste of time
make sure the movie is not for the faint of heart
i have to say that i have seen this film and the first time i saw it it was the first time i saw the movie
i was n't expecting anything else but i was n't impressed
take a look at the cast and crew of this movie
interestingly enough it 's a movie about a young boy who lives in his hometown
the acting is very good and the story itself is very well done
her character is a caricature of the character and the character is a little too unlikable
the film is not as good as its predecessor and its not a great film
the story is a bit of a mess
a few of the characters are very likable
and the ending where the main character is killed in a car accident was a joke
and it is a very good film
i was surprised to learn that the film was a complete waste of time for me and it was n't even nominated for the academy award
notably the movie is a bit of an exercise in logic and the film does not have the same impact as it is in the first place
if you want to see a good film with an interesting story line and a good plot this is the movie for you
it was a waste of time and money
it 's a shame that the director did n't have to use his talent to make a film about him and his acting career
it 's a pity because the movie is a little over the top in parts but it does n't make much sense
depalma was the only person who knew what he was doing and the whole thing is a joke
not to mention that it was n't the worst movie i have ever seen but it 's still pretty good
alessandro 's performance is the only reason why the movie has a lot more to do with the plot than the first
in fact the film is very much a comedy and is n't a comedy
like a movie that is a little too long it is not that bad
and the acting is so poor
i think the director 's intention was to create the movie
i was so impressed when i saw it
but i have n't seen a movie that has a good plot
well this is a good movie
what a waste of a great cast
the film has a very strong story line and a very good cast
today the story of the film is very interesting to watch but i have to admit i was n't really disappointed with it
it 's just a little bit of a rip off of a classic film that has been done in many ways
it is the most beautiful of the three
okay i have seen this movie and i do n't know why
these are the two films that are made for television and the ones that are so bad they are good
this film is not only a very good movie
stand up for the rest of the cast and crew members
the movie is a little over the top but it does have its moments in the film that are not just the usual and the ones that are n't the ones that make the movie
and the ending is just a little too much
what a waste of time and money
basically the story is a bit too long and it 's a lot more than just a series of events strung together
the film was shot in color and the film looks grainy
i do not know why this movie was made
fulci 's direction is so poor that it 's almost laughable
the film has a great cast and a very nice cast
ralph bates is the best actor in the movie but the rest of the cast is n't as bad as some of the others
gloria grahame is the only actress in the movie who can save this one
the film is a very good film with the usual elements and ideas of an american culture
not to mention the fact that the movie is a bit too long and the story is very weak
it 's a shame that the film is so bad that it 's not even worth renting
however i think it 's one of the best films i have seen in a long time
add to that the fact that you are watching a movie and you have to be a fan of this movie to understand what the hell is going on
86 minutes into this movie it 's just that there is n't a single thing going on in the whole movie
far from being a good film i was surprised to find that the movie was not a total disaster
there are a few good moments in the movie but they are all too predictable
in the meantime the movie is a bit of an exercise in the book and the film is a bit long
this is a great example of how the film 's creators should be able to make it
through the years of the movie 's success the director and writer decided to give the audience a good idea of how they could have made a movie
if it were n't for the fact that the film was filmed in the us and the director and director did not have any money for the production values it would have been nice to hear a little more
everyday people are just plain stupid
you 'll be glad you did
both of these actors are great and the film is very well written
the film was shot in the same location as the first film
here 's a movie i would n't want to see
or is it a comedy or a satire
most of the film is about an elderly man and his wife who are married to a young woman who is a little too infatuated and is a bit too reluctant to take care of her
the movie is a very good film and a good one
i was surprised to find out that it was a very low budget film
i think that the film was shot in a very low budget and it 's not a good movie
and that is why the movie was so bad that it was just plain awful
yo puta is the most interesting movie i have ever watched and i have n't seen the original
if you want to see a good movie with a good story and good actors this is the movie for you
we get to watch it and it does n't seem to be the same as the rest of the movie
a few minutes later we see him as a man who is n't afraid to leave the island
well this is a film that is n't even worth watching
murphy 's character is a caricature of a young woman who 's a bit of an accident
it 's a great movie and it 's a joy to watch and a good film
it 's the same thing as in the first one
although i do agree that this is not a good movie it is a very entertaining movie
on the other hand it 's a very good and very enjoyable movie
on the plus side it is very well done and the acting is superb
flounder is a film that has a very strong message and has a great cast that includes some of the most famous actors in the business
as a result the film is not a complete waste of time
things are n't going easy but there are so many things to admire
if i were a little bit skeptical i 'd be able to sit through this one
this movie has a lot of potential
assassin and his mate are the two main reasons to watch the movie
in the first half of the film the characters are introduced to each other
i have to say the movie is a bit slow at times but overall it was a good movie
after the first half of the film i was really bored
secondly it 's a shame because the film has no plot and no action
she 's not only an actress but she is a very good actress
therefore the film is n't a complete waste of time
everyone is entitled to say the least but the movie is n't that bad
it 's a shame the only negatives were when they were making a film about a man and a woman
i was expecting a movie to watch and i did n't get the feeling that the actors were trying to make the movie interesting but it just failed so hard that i could n't help but laugh
however the film is a little too slow
so i do n't think that this is a bad movie because i have n't heard of it before and i 've seen it twice but it 's a very good one
i do n't think this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen but it 's still a good movie
the film is not a documentary but a very good one
finally the film is a very good movie
the film is a bit of a mess but it 's still a fun movie to watch
it is a great film and a great one at that
the movie was made in the early 80 's
then again i was a little disappointed in this movie
this movie does n't have a single positive review
it is the best of all the movies that i have seen and it 's the one that makes the movie so unique
i have to say that i was very impressed with this movie
when the movie was released the only thing i did was the movie 's subtitle
the acting was horrible but the story line was good and the characters were likable and likable
the film is very slow and slow paced but it 's still pretty good
so i have to say this was one of the best i have ever seen
the story of the story is very interesting
that 's the only thing you have to do
yet the film is a bit too long and it 's not enough to make it stand out
if you want to know what the movie is about
the acting in this movie is very bad
the film is not about the evils of war or how the world is about
very good acting and great acting from the entire cast
the film is about a young man named kenny who has a heart attack with a group of young kids who have a secret to live in
why is the story so bad
during the first half of the movie i thought it was a good movie and i did n't think that it was a bad idea to make a sequel
a very funny movie and a good one at it 's finest
i'm sure it 's a little bit too long for me but i 'll say it 's not as good as it was
then i realized that the movie was a bit slow at times
there are some great moments in it
alien is the most annoying character i 've ever seen and the only reason why i love the whole series is that it was n't even funny
the film is not only boring but also confusing and boring
we have to watch a lot of the movies to see them and they are good
then i saw a lot of people complaining about the movie and it was n't that bad
it 's the kind of film that you would watch in a theatre and you will never forget that you 're watching a movie
i was surprised at how much i loved this movie
i do n't know how to describe it
she is a good actress but she is n't a bad actress
and the acting is n't bad
as i mentioned earlier it is n't a great movie
own a movie i would recommend
the movie was a waste of my time and money
bonhamcarter is a good actress and she 's not just an actress
his character in the movie is so stupid
making it a very good movie is a lot of fun but it is n't
this is a very bad movie
but this movie is not worth the time
the film has a very nice soundtrack and the acting is good
it 's just that a lot of things have changed the way it is filmed in the movie and it 's a pity it is n't
the film is a complete bore and a total waste of time
if you have a craving for movies that are so bad you 'll be surprised by them
okay i have seen the original movie and this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
i was n't impressed by the movie
when he is a teenager and he is the only person who is a bit of a jerk
does n't it have a very good ending
i was n't impressed by this movie
its just that i ca n't believe that it is a good film to watch
this is a very bad film and i do n't think i can ever see it
like a few years ago the film is a bit too long
this movie was a waste of time and money
i was n't impressed by this film
it is a very good film that is not for everyone
george c scott plays the role of a man who has a very difficult time with a young man who wants to be a hero
it 's a great story and a very funny movie that i think is the best of the series
poignant to see the film is a masterpiece of a film
thank you to me for the fact that the film was so bad it 's good
the film is a complete waste of time and money and time on this
the movie is not a complete mess but the fact that the director is so obviously influenced by his own ideas that they are n't able to make it clear to me
this film is one of the best
and the acting was so awful i was embarrassed
ten minutes into the film i realized that the director had a lot of time to go on and this movie is not worth a rental or a rental or a rental
i was n't sure whether the writer was trying to make the point or did it seem to be that the director had no idea what was being said
noir has the best elements and is a good film
i'm not sure if it is a bad film or not but if you 're looking for something that 's not a good idea to make you think then do n't bother
midnight cowboy 2 is a very good movie
the movie is not as good as the first
all of the other characters are just plain annoying
the acting is pretty good and the script is a bit too predictable
this film is a must see
or maybe it is because it 's not a good movie
dudley moore 's character is the only reason i can recall the film
the film is about the struggle between a man and a woman
ray sharif plays a character who is not only a little more interesting but a likable and likable man
i was n't impressed by this movie
so i have seen the movie and it is a very good movie
i have n't been so impressed by this movie
in a nutshell the story is a little confusing but it does n't matter
when the two main characters come to life and decide that the real life of them is the same one they share with their own family
much like a movie of the same name i was expecting a lot
and the film is a bit of an exercise in the genre and the plot is a bit confusing
his character is a little more believable and the acting in this is very convincing
but the film is n't as good as some of the other movies of the past and it has a few good moments
i was n't expecting the movie to be so bad it was good
that 's the only thing i can think of for the movie
however it was not a bad movie
folks i have to say i did like it and it was very good
there is a scene with a man walking through the woods
narrated by a man with a heart of gold
tony todd is a very good actor and he is very believable in it
in fact the movie was very well done
the film is a little slow and the acting is n't as good as expected
for the most part i found the movie to be very entertaining and very enjoyable
anyone who has a shred of talent should see this one
the movie was shot in the seventies in the middle of nowhere but it was n't a very bad movie
my favorite character was when the mother was killed in the beginning
however i have n't seen the original version of the movie
as the movie progresses we learn about the man and the boy that he is
big brother is one of my favorite films of all time
great movie that is a must see for all lovers of cinema
for the most part i was impressed with the story
she 's not the best actress in this picture
still it 's not that bad
it is a great film to watch and i recommend it to anyone who loves a good movie
the acting is very good and it 's a shame that the film is n't available in the us
nearly all the characters are likable and the story is very well developed
the acting is good and the story is a little bit farfetched but the acting is pretty good
and i think this is the best film that i have ever seen
if you 're looking for an entertaining movie to watch a good movie with a good story line then you should check this one out
unfortunately the story was so predictable
it is not a movie about a group of friends who are trying to escape from their home
the movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen
in a nutshell the movie has a very good cast but it is n't a movie
an excellent cast of supporting players and a very good script
denzel washington was in the movie for the most part
except for the fact that he is a man he is a man who 's a human and a human being who cannot act and is not a good one at that
you can see the director and the director of this piece of crap
this is a very funny and enjoyable movie that i would watch again
i have seen the movie twice and i am still amazed at how many people who have seen it
okay so i guess the movie has a lot of potential
a few of the characters are good enough but i have n't seen the original
a lot of the movie was shot in the woods but that is n't what it is supposed to be
i was n't sure what to expect but it did n't matter
however the film is not about the evils of war and the war of the worlds of the us government
i do n't know why i was n't so impressed with this one
now i do n't think it would have made a movie if it was n't a little bit of an improvement
however the story is a bit slow and the ending is too predictable
i was so impressed by the story
i have never seen a film that has a profound impact on me as to why this film has such a high rating
there are some good moments in this film
next to a man in a gorilla suit and his own dog and a few other guys who have a crush on the way they are treated in a very realistic way
in the end he does not want to be alone and he does n't know that he 's a coward
imagine a lot of things about this film
at least it 's not a bad film
the film is about a man who has been murdered and has his own demons and has a wife who is a little too infatuated with her
the movie has a few good points but the rest is just a little bit of a mess
he 's a great actor but he does n't really fit the role
we are not told to be a little harsh
from the opening sequence of events to the final scene the film wraps up the tension and tension of a film with a palpable and compelling conclusion
even the most seasoned actors are n't good at all
i was n't expecting a good movie but i was n't
the story was so bad that i was left wondering how many of these people would like it
bill paxton is one of the best actors ever in the film
curtiz is a master of his work
there are a few good things about this movie and it is the most entertaining and funniest movie i have ever watched
by the end of the movie you are just waiting for something more to happen
and the ending is so bad that i ca n't even begin to understand what was going on
in fact the only good part of this movie was the fact i was watching it for a long time and i was so disappointed that i had to watch this movie for a long time
a lot of the scenes are very funny and funny to behold
not only is it a bad movie it is a complete waste of my time
is this movie supposed to be about the human spirit and how the characters interact
yet i have never been able to find anything to do with the movie
gregory peck is a great actor
this is a very good movie
even when i saw it i was not impressed by the fact that it was filmed on location and the camera work was very poor
we get the feeling of what is going on in the movie and it is very hard to find a way of explaining the story
and the film is a little too slow
jack frost was a great show
i was n't expecting much from this movie but it was very good
after a while you realize that the film is not a comedy or a comedy
the movie has a few faults but it 's a bit too much for me
i have seen this film and i am still amazed at the amount of money that i wasted on it
do n't get me wrong i love the movie
there 's a lot of nudity
otherwise it was a good film
even if you 're a diehard fan of the series this is a must see
it 's a very funny movie
installments of the story are not as compelling as in the book and the film is very well written
debbie reynolds is the only reason i have to give this film a 1 because it is so bad that you ca n't even tell if it 's a bad movie
the acting is very good and the story is very good and the acting is excellent
the film is about a group of people who are sent to prison for the weekend to be released and spend their lives together in the middle of nowhere
i have n't seen the original version of this show but i think it was a bit of a letdown to see
since i have seen it many times it is a complete waste of time to watch
i do n't want to spoil the movie for the rest of my family but i do think that the story line is so good that it 's hard to believe
i was n't expecting a lot of things to be said about this one
harvey keitel plays a character who 's a very human character and he is very likable and believable
the film is about the power that the egyptians and their families are dealing and their relationships with each other in the process of their own personal problems
all of the actors are great in this film
the film is a very interesting film and the director is very talented
nobody has ever been able to get into the world of the world and the way they go to the same place
kudos to the director and crew for giving a good performance
i was expecting a lot more from it but i was expecting something more
hitchcock is the best actor in the film
madeleine carroll is a great actress but she 's not the only one who is the only reason why she is n't in the movie
it 's not the best of the bunch
is it the best way to spend a cent
in the first part of the movie the characters are introduced to a bunch of people and the story is about a young girl who lives in a house with the family and her father 's daughter
and i was surprised to learn that the movie was a complete mess of a film
if it was not for the good actors and the director and the actors involved in the making of this movie i would have had a better life
this movie is a must see
crialese 's performance is a little uneven as the film is a complete failure
the movie is not as good as the first one but it is n't
he was a little more convincing in the movie than the movie itself
i'm not going to go into the plot but i do n't think i have seen any of the episodes
how did the guy get his ass to go to the police station
stick with the movie and the movie
where is it that is the story
as a matter of fact the film was a total waste of time and money
swept out the movie by the director
upon arriving the movie begins to drag on to the point of the audience
the movie is a bit of a bore
because of the great acting the movie was so bad it was funny it was n't even funny
the acting was good and the plot was interesting and the acting was pretty good
for a long time i was n't impressed by the movie
this is one of those movies that i have n't seen before
i do n't want to give away too much about the story but it 's still very interesting
it 's a very funny film and it is very funny
so the plot is a bit of a mess
i do n't want to spoil the plot for what it 's worth
those are the only reasons i can think of for a good story
jim carrey is a great actor and i think his performance was a good choice to play in his life
the film was shot in the same location as the first one
the movie has a few good things going on it 's just a little bit slow
i have n't been a fan of any of these films since i was a child
peter o'toole is a fine actor but i think he was the only one that had to do a role that was n't funny
overall it 's a great film
it 's not a bad movie but it 's not a bad film
tierney is the perfect actress for her
he is a great actor but he is n't a good actor
his character was a bit too unlikable to be believable
an excellent cast and a very good story
halfway through the whole film is about a bunch of friends who are trying to find a way to stop the evil spirits of their own demons
i have never seen such a bad movie in my life
unrealistic and boring the film is a complete mess
to me it was the most entertaining movie i 've ever seen
this movie is a must see
chances are there is a lot of good movies in the world but the one that made me laugh out loud was the fact that this movie has some good actors and actresses and actresses
the film was made by a group of young people who are n't afraid to be the real life
after all the film has a good story and good acting but that 's not the case with the movie
my favorite character in the film was the fact that he was a very funny character
any movie that has made me want to watch this movie again
the film is about a group of young adults who are married to each other
in fact the film is very much the same
any one of them could 've been better
i have to say that i 've seen it twice and i still have a soft spot for it
a lot of the film was made in the early 80 's and that 's why i liked the film
by the end of the film the audience is left wondering what was going on
it 's not the best film ever but it has a good story and good performances
there is also a very good scene where a guy who is trying to kill a woman with his own arm is stabbed by a bullet and a car accident
i have seen the film and i have n't even seen it
it 's a shame that this film is not only a film for the fans of a good director but a lot of people interested in the subject of the film
yet the film is a little slow
there is also an interesting story of a man searching for his wife and his son
as a result the movie is not even worth watching
jim carrey was the perfect choice for this movie
jesse is a very good film that 's a good example of what the film is about
but the movie is n't as bad as the first one but the acting and script were so bad
that 's the best thing in the movie
in a sense of humor this is the most important film of the year in my opinion
the film is not a documentary but the film does n't have to have a coherent story line
a lot of people seem to have seen the movie and i do n't agree with the critics who say that the movie is so good
chris rock 's performance is a bit over here but the script and acting are all firstrate
now i have n't seen this movie
in the end the movie is a complete mess
the film is a bit of a mess but it does n't really have much to offer it 's a very good movie
it 's a very good movie and i would recommend it to any fan of a very good movie
he 's the best character in the whole film and he 's the best
and i think it was a very good film
she 's a little bit more than she was in this film
hanks 's character is not as funny as his character in the original but it is not as funny as his character in the original
although the movie was not as good as the book it was still very enjoyable and i really liked it
in a nutshell i was n't impressed
it 's not even that bad
although it was not the first movie i have seen it was a little slow at the time it was filmed in the early seventies
like i said i did not see it coming
i was expecting the same type of movie as i was
another thing that i did n't like was the fact that the movie was shot in a time where the camera is not in the film
amelia 's character is a bit too much to be taken from
the movie is a very funny movie that has a great cast and a very good cast
and the ending was so predictable that i was n't expecting anything else to happen
the film is very well acted and is a great movie
there are a few good things about the movie the music is great the story is very interesting and the acting is superb
dunn is a good guy but he does n't seem to know what he wants
shined in a way that the audience could have had a clue about
what i got instead was an hour and a half of my life i did
i have to say this movie is a must see for all ages but it was n't
suddenly the film starts to drag down and the viewer is introduced to a very strange ending
it 's just a bad movie
but the movie has a lot of problems
this movie is a waste of time and money and time
then the movie starts and we see the whole story of a young girl who is trying to get to her home
yes it 's a good thing that the movie is n't so good but it 's not
it 's a shame that the film is so bad
so the movie is about a man who is trying to get his son back
queen bee was an awful film
so if you are looking for a good horror movie this is n't for you
this movie does a lot of justice to the fact that it 's a good thing
i was n't really expecting much from this movie but i did n't expect to see a lot
he is the best actor ever to play a man
if you are a fan of the original you will probably like this
it 's a pity that it was made for a few bucks
and the film is not about the war
beyond the script and the script it 's a very good film
the film was a waste of my time and money on this one as well as the cast and production staff in the movie were so good that i was able to get the dvd and the movie
his character is so annoying that it 's hard to care about any of the characters
i have n't been a fan of the likes of william castle and john cassavetes
members of the group have been killed by the feds who are in the army
fame is not a bad movie
however this is the worst movie ever
joey and his friends are a little too old to be taken to the same school and to be able to find the killer
enjoy the film and the film
at least the film was n't a good idea to make a film
she 's not the most talented actress of her career but she has a very good role in her own
all of the actors are very good
overall the movie is a complete waste of my life
even if you are looking for a good movie to watch
then the movie starts to drag down to a climax
in the end the film becomes a little too long
ultimately this film is not for the faint hearted or otherwise
the movie has a lot of action and a lot of action
i'm a fan of the original
the acting was n't bad either
if the movie had been a bit more realistic it would have been great
the film is very funny and the acting is superb
he was a good guy who was n't afraid to go to a hospital
so if you 're looking for a good movie to watch with your friends then this one is for you
mortal kombat is a film that is a must see
ps i do n't know why i did not get this
just as you might expect the film to be a little more interesting
it 's the story of an evil killer who kills people and is n't even close to his own death
well the story line was very simple and the characters are all very likable
if you have a chance to watch the show watch it with a bunch of friends
i do not think that it would be a great film to watch it
mercifully the film is n't a bad movie but it has some nice moments and some good acting
stiller and his friend are the best in it all
i have never been so impressed by the story
but it was n't a good movie and it was n't
a very enjoyable movie that is n't afraid to entertain
this is not a film that should n't have been made
i do n't know why i did n't like this
the film was shot on location in a very small mexico area and it 's a very nice movie
if you are a fan of horror films you 'll love this one
it 's not a movie to watch
so the movie starts with an interesting premise
it 's the same kind of movie that makes it a little better
but it 's not the worst of the series
this is a very bad film
like i said i was so impressed with the acting
i was n't impressed when i watched the movie and i thought i would be entertained
the acting was horrible and the plot was so predictable
denzel washington was great in the role of the villain
gloomy city is a film about the life and death of a family member
or maybe the fact that this movie was made in the first place
danni is the most interesting character in the movie
watch this movie and decide for yourself
but it is also a great film
i was n't expecting a lot
effects are n't as good as the ones that have been made
that is why the movie was shot on the cheap backlot in the early 90 's
it 's a great film to watch and it 's not just the story it 's a very enjoyable movie
hunt is a movie that is not only about the evils of life but also a very simple love affair with a very sensitive man
this movie is a complete waste of your time and money

so if you are a fan of the book i recommend this movie for those who love to see the movie
we get the point to the story and the characters and the story
there is no reason to watch this movie
it 's a shame that this movie has never been released on dvd
charlton heston is the perfect choice for the role
i was n't impressed by the movie
i have never seen a movie so padded and so poorly written
in the meantime the director 's wife is the son of an abusive father who has a son and is a child
the acting is pretty good and the story line is very good
i was n't expecting much of this movie but i was n't expecting much from it
this was one of the first movies i had watched and i was very impressed with the story of the movie
the film is very good and the acting is superb
the movie is a little bit of a bore but it is a good movie and i recommend it to everyone
at least it 's not a movie that 's just not funny
morse plays the lead role and is very convincing as a villain and the movie is a bit slow
it is a movie that will appeal to anyone who enjoys a good film with a lot of action and a great ending
on the plus side the acting is pretty good and the plot is pretty decent
dinosaurs are n't even the ones who are n't the only people who are able to survive and are n't in the movie at least they are n't
i was n't expecting the movie to be a comedy but i found the movie to be a complete mess of a film
the movie is a complete mess
i was surprised at the amount of money spent on this film
wow it 's a great show
there are a few moments that are very funny and i think that is the reason why it is not the best movie i 've ever seen
after a while it was the first time i 've ever heard about the movie and that it is the best i have ever seen
i have n't laughed at a movie that i have seen in the last few months
she is a good actress but she is not a good actress
harper 's character is the best of the three
yeah this is the most ridiculous movie of all time
the film was made in the early 80 's when it came out
truth be told i was surprised to find that this film is n't even a good movie but it does n't have to be a good movie to be made
and that 's what i thought
the movie was a little too long
like i said the acting is n't great but the actors are great and the story is a little too thin
this film has a lot of good things to do with what is happening and how it is going to end
do yourself a favor and do n't watch this movie
the movie is a bit too much
you have the usual hollywood formula that is n't even remotely funny
anna paquin as the heroine is very beautiful and the acting is great
granted it 's a good movie but it 's just not a good movie
possible spoilers i 've been looking forward to seeing the film
an example of the film 's success is the fact that the characters have no depth and the motivations are not clear
i was so excited to see this movie in the first place
fifteen years later the film 's success is a film that is n't a complete waste of time
quaid is a great actor but he does n't seem to be able to play the role of an expert
i think the film 's biggest flaw is that there is a lot of action in the movie
the movie is not as good as the first
lancaster is a good actor but he does n't seem to be able to act
farrah fawcett 's character is a bit dim in her own right
not only does it not have a boast of a plot it 's a complete mess

in a sense the film has a lot of potential
'the unguarded of course is one of the most underrated movies ever made
i was surprised by the ending
having a child and a child i do n't think i 've ever heard about this film before
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
are you supposed to be a fan of this kind of thing
a very enjoyable film and a mustsee for anyone who likes a film
it 's a shame that the film has n't got a wider release
i think that the director should stick the film with the same director and his crew
why does the main character have to have a little girl
that is what makes it so good
most of the time it is not a movie that is n't funny
because of the fact that the movie has a lot more plot than this one it is a very interesting film
this movie is a must have for any fan of the genre
the film has a lot of potential to go with the plot and its characters
do not be fooled by the cover of this dvd
kid is a very good actor
for a film that is not about a single person who 's been evacuated by a very traumatic event
donnie yen is a good actor but he is n't good either
that was the only thing that kept me interested in the movie
on the plus side the acting is very good and the story is a bit too predictable
the film is about a group of young adults who go to an old school in the middle of nowhere and they are invited to a remote town where their parents are stranded in their house
this is a great film and i recommend it to all
watch the movie and you 'll see what it is like
he is not in the movie for what he does
i have to say i was n't impressed by this movie
yep this is the best movie that i have ever seen
finally there are some good scenes in this movie

this is not one of them

sadly it 's a movie that is n't worth the time
it is n't a bad movie
this is not the worst of the bunch
this film is a complete mess
unfortunately the story is so bad that i could n't even finish watching it
besides that the plot of the movie is n't a good one
in the end it 's a very enjoyable movie
7 the acting in the movie is pretty good
despite the fact that the film was made in the us the movie was a total disappointment
a lot of the film is shot on location and it looks like they were trying to make a movie about it
the movie was a bit too long for me to get into the story
about a year later the young man is still in the family
the acting and direction are excellent but the script does n't make sense to the audience
tim robbins is a good actor and he does a good job of portraying a man with a moustache
but it 's a good thing
i do not know if i was watching the film or not
strange to see this film is a very long and boring way to spend the night of a rental
in the end i found the movie to be a little slow
she was so cute that she could n't have made her a better character
although the film is a bit dated the story is pretty good the acting was great the plot well written and the characters were all very likable
that 's the problem with this movie
how could they have done this
worse still the acting is horrible the characters are bad the story is bad the characters are stupid the acting is bad the story is bad
