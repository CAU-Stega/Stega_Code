he was a very good character in this film
i saw the movie and was looking forward to the ending which was so disappointing that i could n't stop laughing
yep it 's not as if you are a fan of the genre or the genre
finally the plot is n't too original and it has a few holes
she 's just the only one who seems a little bit like the other in the movie
this movie is about a family and a couple in a small town in new jersey city where they have to go to their own home house
or maybe this is not a bad thing but the fact i was so bored that i had to go to the film and see the whole thing
sadly the movie has a certain charm in it that is not to a degree
it was a very enjoyable movie
this is the first time i have ever seen a show with my parents and i still think it 's funny
this movie was a lot more funny
unfortunately it was not until the end that i did not know what to expect
besides a very good score and a good script this movie is a complete waste of time
in the end the movie has no plot
i have seen it several years ago
7 out there is the story
despite being an american in that the movie is not a great documentary but it was very well done and it was n't that much fun
a young couple is sent to investigate the mysterious murder of an unknown child named angus
the only way you could make a film was so poorly executed that you could not believe it was actually shot in the first scene in a movie
the only good part of the picture is the way that one of the guys says it 's a comedy that does n't make much sense and that just makes it so boring
about a year ago she has been on the same page as she does and she 's now a virgin she is not a happy child she is n't as good and she has no problem with the other people in the film
the plot was a bit predictable and did not make sense at all
tim conway is excellent as his wife who seems like an angel who has the most perfect family
but the rest of it is a little too much for me to really appreciate
i was expecting a lot more and more from the movie but i do n't like the ending as i did
strange is the way to end
in the end he is the best in the movie but the whole movie is n't as good as the movie that the film is
she was a nice actress and had her own personality and she did n't have a lot of her own
although he 's in the movie the film 's only purpose was to make you laugh
that 's the whole point of this show to make a movie
how did they get to do this film
worse yet that the script was n't very good or entertaining
and i was surprised that they made such an excellent film and made it into my top 10 worst list for my collection
bea has a very funny relationship between the two and the two leads are also very good
today 's standards include the first film as well as an extra bonus of the famous bbc tv movie
one of the most interesting parts of the movie is how a movie about a man 's life and his struggle to overcome it is not just a dream film
i would say that i would have liked this movie
my rating 12 stars on this movie
somewhere between the movie and a film
i think it 's a very bad idea
every time i watch it it becomes the first time we hear the word spoken on the screen
in fact i do n't want that but it 's a good idea
everything in the movie is just plain dull
hope lange is able to act like this
when she arrives in her home and her husband says that she has to do the same thing she 's a woman
'a movie about a group of young men who want the gold
he 's the one who gets killed in the first half hour
first we have a very attractive and sexy young woman who has been in a mental asylum for the past 15 months
what is this movie about how
this is n't a bad horror movie
awful acting horrible plot lousy music
after seeing this i had a headache on the box set and then the end
the movie is about as exciting and funny as it 's a comedy
it is not the best of these movies that are not as good as the other ones but the one thing i liked about this one is the way it was used
a very funny scene is when the kids start to get their asses kicked off
however the movie does have a few funny moments but it does n't really work out as the first one is n't
but if you 're a teenager you should n't be a fan of this show
that 's why this is one hell movie that i have seen for a while and i have never seen it before
it was a good film but not in the best of the ways
if you want to see it get a laugh
for the rest i would say the acting is superb
it was a little slow and the movie was just too stupid and boring to watch
then we have two young kids in their late 30s that have to deal with some of the same issues and they are both trying to escape their life
seriously i have no idea how many times he was in the film
this time it was not the first movie that was filmed theatrically
of course it has been made to make some kind that is so bad it 's good
drew barrymore as a mother in this movie does a good job
the film is a very interesting film which is a good one
it 's a real shame because this one just did not seem realistic and i found it to be extremely boring
anyway the only thing that i liked about the whole movie was the music
the film 's plot has been adapted from a novel by a director who was obviously trying to get a message from a different audience that could have made some interesting and enjoyable scenes with an actual story of the president
i'm a huge fan and that was the last thing i noticed and did i mention it was a pretty good idea and it 's not a total loss to say that this is my favourite movie ever
then we got a film of a film that i was expecting a good movie
some of them are n't very good but the script does provide the viewer with some insight into the characters
but it 's also pretty much like that the characters are all too onedimensional and the movie has no flow
thus the film begins in a hotel and is in the background
apologies the movie is very good
well the movie does a lot of research
the first one was a bit of a downer but that would have been a lot less entertaining if it was not for it
i would give this film a 1 out of 10 if you have a rating
but it does n't take too seriously
you can see the end coming out and that is why the film is n't so much the same
it 's a shame that so few of the actors are good and i really think that the cast is very good
this movie was n't funny and i did n't even bother to watch the film
that 's the only reason why the movie is n't a horror film is the director 's name
actually i thought it was a great film
do not waste any time on this one unless your a diehard fan of zombie movie or a horror movie
my friend and we all have been sitting on a couch laughing about the movie
for instance the two are shown as a bunch and their partners are on the run
there was a scene where he was talking for a woman
the acting is n't as bad though it is n't really a bad movie and the actors are not very bad either
indeed the acting is so bad they are n't even funny the actors playing themselves are bad
there was no mention of how they got to the point of making the whole movie to get the message across the country
so why was she doing what they did
and i do not recommend this film as it is not as good as the first two
all the actors and actresses were good especially considering the time of day was spent on their role and in a good movie they do n't get much better than this one i have to admit that i am disappointed at the ending and for the first time i saw the film
i was really impressed by this film which has a somewhat promising plot that is n't quite as interesting to begin to describe
the acting was good and i loved it
if the story is about the people that they are the two protagonists have no problems of this sort or if they want a more accurate love story than that
those who like it are very well done to the story of the movie
the acting is superb with cusack 's acting
also it 's not as funny
ok i guess the filmmakers have no idea of what to expect from this movie
so what if it does have a few good things about it the way that it 's done
he is also a very nice person and the guy is a complete idiot
i think that it is a movie about the life and the life
this is the first and last film which i have been waiting since it 's available on dvd for sale as soon as it was released on vhs
there are a number that will be remembered and that is why i did not watch this movie
later the film begins with one shot of the two leads and the film is a perfect blend
i would love this film to be shown on tv
starsky hutch is a great villain
wooing the two girls and the men and women alike are just so funny and they do not show any real interest in it
maggie watson plays the mother 's mother
bel colbert is a good actor in this
additionally they had the advantage of being able into the movie 's own success but the script and direction could have been so good
having just finished the dvd of gallipoli and having watched it i had the impression it would be an excellent movie that had the intention that the filmmakers wanted to be a little more interesting and the audience was n't really interested in it
the film is set in a remote mansion in mexico and the world is a bit uneasy but that is the problem with it
even the actors do n't look at that
the only thing that was missing is a scene that lasts for 15 years and the two have an affair with the same person and the rest was pretty bad and i do not think that even the slightest part of the movie is funny
ironic it 's just a bad movie but not a horror flick with some really good fight sequences
she 's not in the movie for the most part but it 's just a great actress with a heart and a heart that makes you wonder
i 've seen a lot of movies that make this a bad and bad movie but i think it would be a good idea to make a movie out in the box art
there is a reason this film is so good that the director and his crew have been involved
if there are some good actors and the cast is good the acting is great and this is a very fine show i think that if you are not a fan of the original series you should n't miss this show but you will be very pleased
he 's just the kind of guy with a soft spot for women who would have thought a movie about him in life
oh and the scene at the party with the girl in a bar where the camera was so bad is that i do n't think that is the fault of the director
on the other hand i think that the film was a complete waste by the time he died
well this one is n't even good enough but the acting by far is pretty good
they were both funny and were just plain stupid
there have n't been a whole movie in this genre where this one has a chance that a good director can make a movie like this
if i was a fan i would rate an 8
if you 're in the mood for a good laugh and just a good laugh this movie will probably appeal a lot more
the only reason that i have n't heard of this show was to watch it and i do not want to watch a movie with a better cast
the story was interesting and it is very hard to follow
you know that the film was shot on location with the sound and the audio
the story was good and i did n't know what to do
they 're just trying too hard
this is not a film for everyone 's intelligence
however as the story develops the story becomes a bit thin at the same time
this movie is a must see
but the film 's plot was so weak and ridiculous that it 's a waste your money and watching a movie that was so horrible that i was actually surprised
worst of all the acting is terrible at times and there 's not even that funny
the story of a young child who is a very young man from the south is an interesting experience for the film 's creators
my wife and i saw this film in a theater theater and i loved the movie immensely
but then again what do i know this was supposed to have been a comedy that was not made as a serious film as it is just a movie
he 's a man he 's not a very human man
hopefully he 'll make a movie like that one but not a lot
one thing you can do n't get the idea that the movie is being filmed
this is the worst film i 've had the misfortune of seeing
just the way they go and make up for that
the script was n't too bad and the acting and direction was terrible
if it 's not funny it is not so bad it is good
the only thing that was n't bad was that the movie had no real point to it
dolemite and his mate were also good and the film was a good watch
frequently he has an affair with the girl
if you 've never seen anything like the last two years you 'll know what i am going through
it was a great movie and it 's the funniest thing i have to do to watch it again
the film opens up with some interesting scenes and turns out to be the one where anakin gets his hand on the head of a car driver and he 's a bit reluctant to be taken by the police
i have n't seen many other movies like this one which has the same appeal as the first
maybe the best part in this movie was the music by the guy in a suit
one of the most enjoyable films i have ever watched
when the first movie came out the first time it was in theatres it became an instant favorite
its a good thing that i did n't get it
she 's an actress who can do so much more than that
if you 're looking to see a great movie about a group that 's going on a mission you have to watch the film
i do not want the audience to see this movie again because it 's so good
liz is the daughter 's sister and is not only her mother but is a good person and her son is the most sympathetic of the world 's population and is very very much of a father and son
although it does n't seem to be the same movie i did n't like it it was not a movie about the life of two young girls who were born to be in the middle east
under the influence of a great cast this film was a major success of a movie
and then the film cuts into a whole lot more than that but it has the best of everything
i am not kidding that they have all been given a good opportunity to show the world of this world
years of this one 's been rediscovered by the critics
and the scene where he is supposed to be a cop is the worst thing i 've heard
he was so annoying and had no sense to make a sequel
the only reason for this is to make some viewers laugh in disgust because the film is not a total disaster it 's just not as fun and fun at all
you do n't see the film as a matter of fact but it 's definitely one of the best i 've come across
this is a good movie that you 'll enjoy watching
douglas fairbanks jr is a joy to watch and i have always admired him
the plot of this movie was so stupid that i could not bear the whole thing
this movie is a must see
one of my favorite movies was that this is a movie that 's supposed to be the best movie ever made
that 's not the point here
i think this is one to see
one thing he could have done was the movie
this is a very well acted movie that will keep a lot to its audience but the most enjoyable thing to come in the film was the fact that they were so funny
even the soundtrack is n't bad
you can see it in the theater and that it was a good movie
the film 's climax in the beginning is a bit ambiguous but i think it would still be a little more interesting and i would n't have to have it been a good horror movie with such a great ending as the main character 's
i have seen it many many times and each now i am hooked in it 's stupidity
although i have no idea what this film has to work it 's a waste
the story of two families living in a country with a young girl and her mother 's friends is a bit of a bore
a few scenes with an interesting character and some of them were so funny and i laughed hysterically throughout
if they do n't have the decency to make something interesting this is the film
what was the point of the film
when i first watched it on cable tv and thought was it really the worst i 've heard
if you have n't read the book you 'll know what to expect and the ending makes you wish it would have worked
most people have n't seen this movie and i'm not sure why i am not a fan of this show or just enjoy the show
apparently the producers have to have something to do but this is no excuse to be the first
and the scene that makes the film work in a film is what the characters are
however the film does n't really have the budget to be good and it 's not
i 've seen it several many more time and still feel like a good movie and i really do n't care
i was surprised at that because of the lack of a plot
here 's hoping you can find a movie where you can get it
enough of the same kind of people in the movie to make a film
it is a great movie for all those who can appreciate it very much as i do enjoy it
i was expecting an action movie to watch but it did
as i watched the film i was hoping i would enjoy it more
if they had n't done a movie like this it might 've been good to see them but it just is n't
buck and the other two of their men have an affair
the script is very poor as it goes
the movie does have a few funny moments but it 's too short
antwone kapoor was a great actor but this movie is just horrible and the acting is so bad i could forgive the movie for being a little better
the plot of the original is that the writer was a man and he has a very limited amount of money
it 's a very nice thing for me
it is a film that i would rate it higher than i had anticipated
sadly this is not a bad thing
i was n't expecting a movie about him and what happened to me but i think i would be better off
and the acting is good the directing and direction is flawless
there are many many more examples of the film which is a bit of a letdown but this is one that will not disappoint anyone that has a chance of seeing it or just have an opinion
one of my favorite movies i saw and it 's just great fun
this is not a very good movie but it 's very entertaining
it is a very funny movie about friendship between love love and romance
so what does the director think he was doing when he made this film for the money
i 've read many other comments on this site and i must agree with the other comments on the other comments i 've read the positive comments here i 've seen worse but this one had it in spades so i could n't
evil is a very good movie
someone else has commented on that the film is a very long and boring one
the story of the movie has been made and i think that the acting was very good the plot is good and there is a lot of action and suspense but the rest is just boring
the film is a great piece of work
i was a little surprised at first but then it was a little bit of a surprise to me
the only real gripe with the movie though is its lack of originality
the script was so bad that it was hard not to laugh through
based on a short story the novel by the director writer david o selznick who also has a very faithful knowledge to a subject
you do n't get a chance
they did the best they could with that movie
fred williamson 's performance is also good as his brother who is a very good actor in the film but he 's very effective as the conflicted and confused wife
i would n't call it a masterpiece but it 's certainly not the worst of it 's kind
it was the worst movie i have ever seen
during this period the story of the movie as the main character is very good in the end of the movie
but it 's just too much
what the most amazing movie was that it was a good film
this is a very good and very entertaining horror thriller
it is a movie about a very complex subject
with this one i thought the film would have been a little better had it had been cut into an hour and a minute or a bit of an hour of wasted time
i think that the actors were good
the film starts off with a couple of scenes of violence but the rest are all downhill
do you like me to get your heart
this is a very well made piece
if there ever was an explanation that is the case with the film i 'd be happy
my advice is that it is a movie that will appeal to people who like the music
now we do n't really see him in anything
kids are n't the ones that are n't supposed to get married and that 's just what they do
the movie is a little slow and the ending is predictable
the script was a bit of one sided at least to be a little bit predictable
but then again i 've seen the whole movie and i'm still watching it
simple story is a great example of how a director like john waters can get into the story and the film 's direction is not a problem
since the movie is about a group of people who have no problems they have the right to know where it was
dennis hopper is also good here as the villain
d the story is about a bunch of teens who get a little weird but their parents are n't very different from the first one
his acting was so horrible he was a real joy to sit right with the guy
it 's a shame to see such a great talent in the future that he has been in the making of the film in his first effort to be one that i ca n't even remember seeing
my advice is if you like a great book of the original and with a strong story and great actors it 's a good one to watch but it 's not as bad but it 's still pretty funny in spots but not as funny
do n't worry that i did
i 've seen better acting in elementary movies and i can honestly feel sorry for the guy who plays the lead role
and it 's the kind of thing that makes you think that this film is n't worth renting
hero 's wife is an interesting character that has some similarities but he does not seem like a real character
there are so much better ways out of these types
anyway this movie is a total waste
one thing that was good about that was that the director was so busy working in that area where the movie was set in the early 80 'searly 1950 about an 8 yearold who is a professional pianist
it is not a film that is meant as a comedy or a horror thriller it just makes you laugh
even when the film was released at the time of its first release the film is about as close as it could be
that said the movie is not bad but it is a little slow paced
this is the best of all the movies that came along i saw the last and the second series
this is a very funny movie that i would watch over the years
i do not know what this is
that 's why the film was n't a total mess
the film is n't even a classic film
with the exception he could do a great job
as a movie it has the feel that the movie was made by the director who had a good time making it
thought about it was a good idea and that 's what happened
so much of the film was filmed on a shoestring day
even the title is n't really that bad and it 's not even a good sign for a bad film and the director is just not able
once he 's revealed that he is a real person he is not a bad movie and a lot more than he was
the script is very weak and not funny enough to hold my interest in this movie
as it is there is a lot to be said
reno is a very strong character but the film is a total waste of time
one of his best and most memorable roles
having watched the first episode i was hooked in a very difficult way
the only redeeming feature in this movie was that it was so bad
really the best part of the movie is the one where the father is trying to escape the girl and then he is the father who is now in the car and he 's on the run with his girlfriend and her boyfriend
boy is it an insult to the producers of the movie that it 's the worst of the year i 've seen
if you like a good horror film you should be disappointed
on the other hand i do n't want it
the acting is horrible and the plot line is a complete waste
speaking of this film i would n't want the cast of this movie and any other movie to have a better script than any other
as the movie goes along there is no reason to be a fan of the original film
this movie is the best of all time and the best film i had ever watched
the film starts with the death scenes where we 're talking on our own and our hero 's character is so boring and uninteresting
we see a young girl with whom i do n't want him
dreadful acting awful acting and a complete waste
i was so disgusted and embarrassed to see the movie i was so shocked that i was so angry at the beginning i was just so bored
this movie was so bad i wanted my liver back
its not a good film but it 's certainly very good
now i have to say that i was so excited when i finally got the opportunity to watch a screener of this movie
as for me i think it would n't be a movie that is not even close
in my view the worst film ever made the worst i have watched
he does not even get a chance for her
chud is n't one to watch
what is the deal with that girl and what happens
also it was the best movie ever made
so i think that this movie is just awful it just does n't work
why not just have a couple of mates on this one
i do not think that it 's a good film for anyone interested to the extent of the subject of a film
the acting is n't very well done although the acting was n't bad either
the film is set in an apartment somewhere near the beach
presumably the producers did n't get the credit
i would like the to see if this was a remake
glad it was on the dvd or the movie
these are the two reasons the movie has been criticized for the film 's release of the film
i do not think that this is a real good thing
and then there 's that in a nutshell
the only thing i can think of that is that it is a movie that is n't worth a lot of money and is a wasted bonus for all those who are n't looking for the movie
but i guess i can overlook a lot of the things that are said
and that is what the movie is all about
ps this is a bad movie
this is the first and final collaboration of a great man to the world of the greatest of his films that i have seen him to be a master of cinema and this is the most unique and compelling film he has made to date and is certainly a master of film making with all his soul and soul in it
perhaps that should be enough to warrant a razzie nomination nomination
it is a great story for people interested and if that is true or not
there are many things that have n't changed much of the plot in the novel but this is just a bad movie for the entire family and the story line is n't even that good
action packed action sequences with great acting skills and a very cool ending
no one is going to be the next least and i have no clue how anyone could possibly have a movie on my list of 10 bucks and have to say something about it
a movie about a young girl that has been kidnapped and tortured with a very good looking woman
jamaica inn is a very funny and very enjoyable film
i was so excited to see this movie
martha silverman does an excellent job with the film but the script does seem to lack a lot of believability
i am a fan like the first movie
however the movie is just plain bad
guinevere has a good job and the only way she can be a real character but she is very believable
this movie is a waste of money on the part and it 's a waste of your money
this movie was n't the same
i 've heard about this film as a very bad movie i ca only watch this movie once every year in my wallet and i have to be my own
i was surprised to find the story and character of a woman falling in love but in the end she 's just trying to get her to be a little more interesting
when the movie ended i could have been a better person but this film is a terrible attempt to make this one funny
some of these characters are so real it makes you wonder how the actors and crew would react to each character
interestingly the movie does n't work for me and there is n't a single memorable performance by the two main characters
the only thing that really makes me laugh is the fact the movie was shot in black white but that 's just a matter
a good film and a lot more powerful
at first i thought it would have some sort
starting to lose its way in the midst of the first one and the end the movie ends up being too slow to be a complete disaster
yeah there are some nice things going on with a bit of nudity but there is no suspense in this movie
i 've been a fan of a lot of people in the past 30 months to find this movie but i was surprised that i did not get to see the movie
and the ending is a little unsatisfying for anyone involved with this
roughly the whole movie is just too stupid and boring to make anyone interested
bette midler has been a good actress for several years and is now a great dancer
maybe it should just end but i do not see it for anyone who is interested in seeing it as well
guess who he was supposed the last scene
all in all a very disappointing and very watchable film
it was a very nice surprise
anything that 's supposed or whatnot but that 's what the story is
the only redeeming feature in this film is the fact that the characters themselves were so stupid they 're just so annoying
fast forward button and a good dose of comedy to boot it 's all in the family and that 's what makes the film
you do n't want any of the actors
it 's a movie about the dangers of friendship in the middle east
he is an actor who is always playing a character that is not only a comedy he does n't even need to have an accent
then again i would have preferred it to be a little less than a bit of a bore but it did n't really fit into the first two films and i would have preferred that it was made by some other filmmakers
he has to deal with his own life and is n't afraid to take a chance at a mental institution and the people he loves
there are a couple of things i liked most about this film and i really liked it
not only does he not make a film about a man but he does n't want a lot
because this is one of them
this is a movie that is very good
the story was so bad it 's almost nonexistent
i do not think that any of these characters could possibly have been so funny and the chemistry was very believable
it has a very interesting and very interesting story line
so the film is also the most boring movie i can remember seeing in the cinema and was not even nominated
if you are into a good b horror movie with a few laughs and some laughs you might enjoy the movie
just as the film was shot at the very end i did n't see the whole thing
it has a good cast and great acting but i did n't expect to be able to watch the whole thing
and what 's up with all that
is it a good film or a good thing
the film is not only boring but it 's a very enjoyable film and a very good experience
not to mention this is the worst film i have ever had my wrists and my eyes and my toenails and my friends laughed my teeth off
of that many of the other reviews here say about what it 's really like
there 's a lot more going for them
these two actors are all superb
i think the movie was a little over the heads with a capital d but the acting is just terrible
i think the best part of the film is when the girl is killed
if the producers of this movie did n't want to get into this mess it would be a waste for the film but i guess the director is trying to be a bit of a joke but fails to impress
this movie is a must see
i have n't read it for years to come
also the music is a complete ripoff and is the most haunting aspect of the movie and its very very real life
i was expecting a lot more from this but this one did not have the same appeal as the original it 's just not as good as i expected
here the movie is not for everyone who wants a film to watch and enjoy
however i do n't know why this movie is so much of an action movie
well i have seen this film in a few years and i think i would love to see it again and the first 30 minutes i watched it
the plot has a lot to do but the movie is n't so boring that i can only say that it is a bad idea
the script does have an interesting twist
this movie was so bad that they made it to mars to see it in the theater
they have no problems with the plot but it was a very good movie and the movie was great
in a film that is not in the same way as the first one
we are told about a man who is a man and a woman who has to fight the urge to marry his wife
a very enjoyable film but i have nothing against it
congrats and not to mention the acting
in the end he is a very very good actor who can act and he makes a very good film in this
but the film does n't have a particularly good story
the plot has an interesting story and a great script but the acting is so terrible that it is difficult to get through it
what a waste of talent and talent
you can watch it and then laugh at you
anyway it 's a very entertaining film
and if you 're a big fan you might think this movie is good
and the whole idea of a film which has a great cast a great cast a good script great actors an intriguing story a great soundtrack
better luck on the big screen with a more productive story of an aging woman who 's hired a career for a crime
this movie was a huge let down
it is very good and has some really good scenes and some nice scenery
it is a movie that you can watch and enjoy and appreciate the acting is wonderful
she 's just so cute that she is so sexy
not only the movie is so bad that i have no idea why this film was made
it 's just a bunch of kids trying and a bunch of people in a car crash with a baseball cap
while a few years ago i had never been watching this movie for a long while at first i was still thinking about renting it in the theater and the other night and watched a movie called 'the muppet movie'
in this case the film makes a great contribution
there should have had been more of a good film about this type of relationship between the two
on a way to be the first one i can think about it
fortunately it 's not even funny
rating 2 stars out of 5 stars because that 's what it is
as with most of the other films this one is a little bit of fun for a younger audience but it is n't
there was a little more of a lot of the humor in here but there 's still some very funny bits in here which are very funny
next time i see it i would n't go into a movie with this kind of thing and not have to worry for it
you can only get a sense from the director of a great cast and a great soundtrack
could n't have had a more accurate story and the characters were believable
the first time he is in the movie he says i have the opportunity to see the movie
poitier 's performance was the highlight of the film
it would have worked if a more serious movie had made it a little shorter instead of a boring story
michael madsen is a great villain and i have seen many of his other films
these days i was able into the lives in my life and i was able to see the end of the film until i realized what to expect when i had to see it
i was n't expecting a lot
if you 've read the books of this movie you 'll know why they are in the movie and why they did n't have to be in any movie at times
when he meets an old friend of the woman he is sent to jail and is sent back home to work in the hotel and he finds a new job for her and her husband
i was n't impressed at all but the acting in general were so bad they could make the film worse
and then it was just the same
it has been the last movie that i 've seen in my lifetime so far
below a few years of age i was a fan of this film but i still do not understand why
did n't you think that a movie about this man was a bad guy
some people might think that it is not a movie for everyone but if you are a diehard fan like me and have a great interest with the genre it might be the one
i do believe it to take the first 10 minutes or two to get a 0 out of 10
one of the best movies i 've seen
as for it all the film was made in a time where i had the feeling that it was not as funny or even the same type of thing it was later as i thought
what a waste of time a great actor and his acting career is the only actor who has any role whatsoever in this film
stefan is a man who believes in god
rupert grint 's performance is very funny and is a great performance in the film
if you 're looking for a movie that has nothing more to do with the original than this you should definitely check it out
that is why i give it the lowest rating of this film but i can say the ending is pretty good
it also does not take long for her as the lead actress who is also a great actress
defined as the film 's title sequence in this movie it 's a very good movie
so i was not disappointed at all
i think he 's a little generous at times as it is in his movies that he did not even make the big ones at least in this movie
this is a very bad remake
for the time the characters are n't fleshed out and the movie never gets boring
i think that this should be a warning that you will have some fun to watch it
a lot of these are the kind of movies that you should watch at least once
not only is this film an utter failure it is also very funny and a nice change from a very good film that is worth watching
these are the two things i did n't like about the first movie but it was so bad they could n't even get the worse
supporting character actor is a bit too old for this role and his portrayal is a bit too much for me
it 's a pity that it is not a success to see it 's release
what i got was an extremely moving and powerful account of life in a modern era of the time
they have a great deal to say to each others the characters and the story
it was n't so much the acting and the plot that i could n't help but feel like i did
i think the main point of this film that was to be a scene where a guy who gets killed by his wrists and a couple who were in the car crash was just stupid but it 's so damn that you do n't even want to watch it and you 'll get bored by it and do n't want to watch any of these things but if you have n't read any other review you 've got an interesting premise this is what happens when the characters are introduced to each other and the story is so predictable and so boring it 's not funny
the plot of a serial and the girl from the original movie is so good and so funny
that would be the only thing you can do to get the idea across
acting wise but that is what the movie is about and how the director is the one responsible that the director could not be in his position as the writer of that
i was so excited by this movie
certainly this was an excellent movie
it 's a shame that the only reason i gave a movie a 1 instead a 1 is it 's bad
the script is very clever and very entertaining
throughout the course the movie is about four sisters each one of whom is in love with each other
does n't that have the potential to do the right thing in a movie where the movie is so much better that i have to give up and write
truly one of the worst movies i 've watched in the last 10 years
there is a lot of sex in the entire movie but there 's also plenty of gratuitous gore
i'm sure the writers did a good job of showing this movie
in the end i did n't care for the character or the plot
because he seems to be in the film
some are very few movies but i am a fan of these type of movies and have been looking forward for the ones to enjoy
it 's a movie you would love your parents if they had to do it a little more than it did with it and the fact it was not a great comedy should n't be missed
nick nolte 's character was so unlikable that i had no interest in him at all but was just plain stupid
the film has some nice cinematography and good performances
by all means it 's not a great film
it 's a good film about the evils of war and the aftermath that they have to overcome the enemies who are the ones they are n't trying
crumb is a good film to play and a must see
for a long shot of a movie that could have made the audience a little more interesting to watch
having said that it 's the funniest thing in this movie
the movie is a total waste
ok let my imagination do something wrong i did
unfortunately there 's a lot of action in here and it is a little bit over time
so why do n't he just have to kill a woman
the film was a complete mess
it was n't that bad i thought it was a great movie
basically this movie was n't bad enough to have the feel and the plot is not very interesting or original
yet this is not the case
soul whitaker 's performance in this was not as strong or as well known as the first film but he was a great actor in a good film
to the producers of this show the writer has a great talent
the story is a little bit too simple and i ca n't help it
whereas the acting in the film is excellent as the film progresses it 's also the first
i do n't remember how it was so bad but it was so funny
i do remember the name of the movie
this is a movie about an aging man who wants a man who is a man who is in the wrong hands and a young girl named kaurwaki
one could argue they were making some really good horror flicks in a hurry
i'm sorry i have never read the book
bill paxton 's character in this movie is an absolute hoot in a lot but the movie is very funny and it 's a good movie to have seen it twice
the only problem is the script by david mamet the author and writer director michael almereyda
but it was so bad that it could n't even save the movie from being boring and not funny just not funny at all
it is a film that i enjoyed to my stomach
one day the woman finds herself in an abandoned village of the deceased and is attacked by a werewolf
the story is a little farfetched
then he goes on an emotional quest and he becomes involved with a bunch and the other characters
part 3 was about a couple of kids who were n't very happy
drago 's portrayal is as usual but that 's not enough to redeem
i would give a movie 10 stars
unfortunately he is n't given much more in depth
i 've seen a couple of episodes of them but i have not seen it
i'm not the kind of people who can enjoy this movie but it is the one that has it not been made for tv
walk through this one with a straight face
do you think the actors were good
phantasm is the perfect example for the movie
employing the help of a friend who had a crush on the woman he was in the house of the dead woman
monster is so good in the beginning but that is what makes it so enjoyable
carole lombard is the only one who could have pulled her off with this film
but this is n't a movie that will appeal for anyone
as an adult i can understand that they were in their youth but their lives are too old for the age
the film also features a lot more of the same cast
a film is not for everyone
this is one film that should never be forgotten
in fact i was not impressed by the fact it was filmed on location in the desert
the plot is so bad it 's almost unbelievable
there 's a lot to like here
electric aluminium and the sundance films are all so bad that they are good in every aspect
it is not that he does not look much like his wife or the person he plays in the film is a caricature
the film has some great moments but is n't enough and the story is just plain stupid
many of us would not even get the opportunity for the show to come out in the first few years
well you can see it 's just not the best
the only thing that makes this movie worth seeing it is that it does n't seem so real
the film is about three women living in a different type of world
the movie is a great mix of the old western western of the 40s the characters and the stories that the characters were trying
the plot is about two young girls in love with one another and they have to go to bed
following the death scenes the actors and actresses are the only ones in the film who actually seem able in that
it 's like the director wanted some of the same actors and it was n't funny at first
the movie has the worst special fx i have heard of a million budget movies but they do n't have the resources or resources of it
so what is the deal with this
robert culp is the most convincing in the movie and he makes the film bearable
good acting excellent direction good story line and it really does
the plot is n't all bad either and the plot line seems rather stupid
so it was n't that easy to be objective when it was done that would be good for the audience
a film of this kind is n't as bad as this one
the film is a little more of a comedy than a movie and it 's not very well written
but the movie is not the best film ever made
finally after the first 15 mins i was n't bored
we all have a different view of the character and his motivations and his character
i was very skeptical to watch a movie with the actors and actors that are all very convincing in this film so i was n't going to give it a chance and not because i wanted the movie to end but instead i was so bored
the first film of the movie is an excellent one and one of the best ever
zac efron is a very good actress he is very beautiful in his first starring role
the film does n't seem to be that of an action film
may i think the movie could have made a good movie
another example that the film is being the first of two movies made in the first half
i 've never seen such an amazing and wonderful movie
however it 's a great movie
while this was a really good movie it was not even bad in the slightest
grease is a movie about two friends who are a young son who is married by the other members of a group of people
the story is so ridiculous that it 's not worth mentioning
i think it is very rare to see the movie that is n't in any way of depicting a true story as a story about love between a man and his wife but it 's not all bad
i was expecting a lot more of her character
we do n't know who it 's or what he is but he is not a very nice person
i was a fan that saw this movie
you do n't want to be a great fan of the show and you can do something
this is a very very good film and i recommend the film for those of you that have n't read the book
affleck and his cohorts are a bunch of people with their own eyes
quickly the two main male characters are a stereotype of the same man and the young woman has a heart of gold that is not a bit of an explanation
and it 's just the icing that i think
tony leung is the most talented actor ever to grace a screen
the script for a little girl and the story is just plain dumb
i am so upset by this film
and the movie is really bad that is just a little too bad
the story is simple but it 's very well done
valiantly the film was made in 1980
there is no way to get out and it is a little confusing in places
in a nutshell the only thing that was worse than this movie was the ending and that 's why i was hoping the movie would redeem the audience
in my view it is a movie of a kind
a film that was a waste on the original
anita winger is the only character who has any depth
dramacomedy about the man 's death was a great way to get a better idea of the film
was n't he going to see this
fortunately it is a great family film
there are many scenes that do n't even seem real at all to this one
or even better yet to come the movie
his character was a bit of a loser who was a little nervous and was not even in the film
the movie was so good it could have gone from an objective view to the very end in a different way and that 's what the director is about as a film
plus the scene where he is talking is a very disturbing experience
6 out it 's good to watch but it is still worth a watch for all
although there is a lot of sex there is n't too much nudity in this
i do agree with those that you have the opportunity of seeing another one of the best of them
boring boring boring boring and just downright stupid
my advice for this is to steer clear from the video
charles durning was great as his sidekick and i thought he would be good in his role
ok it is very good for a good film to get a hold on
i do n't think so much of this is a great thing
based on the autobiography this film has the potential to have the same story
so it seems that they were making a film about the dangers of the vietnam and the history of the west
if you want to see a movie that makes you want the story of a group of people to take a trip to the desert where the characters are all there and the way you are to feel in a world that is n't you should watch this movie
it does n't matter but the fact that the main characters are not so bad they 're actually very good
player 's father does a pretty decent and believable character in the movie
he does n't get it right
the acting was so awful that i felt sorry for myself when it was supposed to be
the film is about the man who is trying to kill the president of his own life
i would n't go to waste any time or money but i have seen it
i am a fan of his work but this one is one of his most overrated movies and is a very good movie
she has to be in the spotlight to do that she is the first to get her money back
i was really disappointed in the first 15 minutes of watching it i had to stop it at any cost but then i realized that it was a bad movie and i just could have sworn it was made for the sake of being a cheap slasher movie and if you 're in a good mood to be entertained i guarantee you 'll be rewarded
especially the two men and the mother
in fact the film also has a couple more interesting aspects
on the other hand there are a few good points in this otherwise weak movie but it 's a great movie
the plot is n't all that interesting and the characters do n't really seem very interesting
if it 's not so bad i ca all
the script and the script are pretty good but it 's the only reason i can think of for anyone interested in this film to make it through a movie
but it does seem to me to have more of a plot than a lot more
but the film itself is a bit long in the end but not as good as the original
and i have no idea what the hell happened next
this is not just a good film it is a complete and total disgrace for all the wrong people to watch it is a good film with a message to it that it 's a real life
there is a little to say about this show
series of events that do n't have a single character in the series are all the same
bother me and my friend to watch a lot of these movies and have fun to watch but do n't bother
just because he was not a master and a bad actor was beyond words but it was a pleasure to watch
if the movie was n't funny and funny at least it had a bit more laughs
then you can see the end coming and it really takes off and i think that this is a very good film that 's not to be taken seriously
otherwise it 's a very entertaining film
when the movie ends i will be honest
elements of the original film do have the impact of the film
sheba has been a great actress and has a very small screen time
for some people it would be a waste and then i was disappointed by this film
another problem is that the movie is not even worth watching for its unintentional jokes and situations
they do n't want to talk about the way they are treated but the fact of the matter is to give up a little of the story of the killer and the girl
the movie has a great deal going for it and it 's not that the film is too bad it 's just that bad but it is so bad it is actually funny at times but it 's just too bad to have made sense
dyan minnelli gives a very good performance as the head and sara 's character
in addition to some of the scenes the movie goes beyond just a boring story that is completely lacking any real depth and meaning to the story which is not a good thing for a comedy or an action film and i did enjoy the movie
the film has a great deal of action in the beginning and the ending is very satisfying
do n't expect too much from this movie
this is n't a bad film
yes it 's pretty bad and it is the kind
the acting is horrible the script sucks
the only thing this movie really did was a bit too short for my liking
this movie is a waste of time
i would n't have to say that this is an excellent film
the acting is very good but the story really sucks
there 's no need to see this
one of the most interesting parts in history
the film was a lot of fun but i really do n't know where to start it
times i did n't think the film would be as good or original but i have seen the other three
george lucas 's character has a very small amount and lots but the film is a complete bore as far from that is it is a mess
the first thing i noticed is how this film has a reputation as its not funny in any sense of the term
there is a lot to like in the story but there are so many unanswered questions in this movie that they have n't done it
it also makes the film look like a good idea
ring 0 was an entertaining film
it is a movie that is so much fun
this film is not the best but it has to offer it 's own
the story revolves around a group who have been living in the us in the early days of the 1960s and their relationship is a bit too dark for their own good
the first is a little more interesting than the usual suspects of the first two
a movie about a woman 's life and her family in the family 's home
but that is just the right thing to say about it
the acting is very poor and the characters in it are just plain stupid and stupid and that makes the whole movie even worse
the film 's climax is the most memorable moment in history
i am a fan that is not a fan and i'm not a huge believer in this movie but i think it will give us an insight into the life and times that is now
atrocities and women are the best friends
it 's a movie with no redeeming features
it is an amazing film and the performances from the cast is great and i have seen many many other movies from the era such as a good deal but this has got to be the best one in my opinion this is the worst i ever seen in the cinema
pitch black is one of the most beautiful movies ever made on a shoestring budget as to why this movie has n't won awards
bring this one back together for a movie that was not a great comedy but a good one at that it 's not a comedy
i think they did this movie in fact they could have done better with the script they 're in
another problem with this movie though is that i ca all remember how the characters were in their own lives and the movie did n't even seem to have a purpose
magnolia was n't the first movie i watched but it was a very entertaining experience and i enjoyed it very much
ok i guess you can see the film on its release
this is an absolutely awful movie and one that i would not have missed
graphics are used in this movie as an excuse of the film to be a little too slow
in this movie he is a little stiff and not much else but a very likable character he is in a coma
i was n't really expecting anything from the acting but it was n't that good and i did n't like it too often
4 stars are the two of them and the movie is about a guy who was born in a mental asylum
well that 's what the filmmakers do with the director
capone has been the hero for years to come from his family and he does n't know that there is a secret for his life
one of the worst movies i have ever seen
and that 's why i did n't care if the actors really did n't want to be in them and i was not impressed to see them in a movie i 'd be embarrassed
dahmer is not a very nice and exciting film but its a really great movie
this was the most pathetic movie ever to ever grace the movie
on a scale of 1 to 10 1 it was a bit of an hour long but i still think it would make some better
there 's a good reason to make a movie that will keep a good audience interested in the genre that is
for instance the whole idea of the movie was a joke that is not to be taken seriously but the director is n't afraid of the story or the characters
the plot is pretty simple and very interesting
this is one of the better films of its era and it certainly is one that you will enjoy
great performances from the two leads
patrick bateman is a good man who is just not a great actor
susannah york was an amazing and very popular movie that i would have enjoyed to my children and grandchildren i would love to see
he 's a good looking man who is n't afraid to fight for a few days
freezing 's is an entertaining movie and one of its best in its own way but it 's not the least bit interesting and not worth it 's fav rating
the script is n't the worst thing i 've heard
the film is a good thriller with a nice twist ending
and then it 's a little too late on it 's own and it really is the best film i 've ever watched
i was so bored i could have done something more productive with the story
as far as i know they are n't going to make a sequel to that one but i 've read the book
american graffiti is a film that will leave many people wondering what is going on
it is a film with a lot of action scenes but it 's not very well done
this movie is a must for anyone looking for a film to sit up with a good book
the acting is horrible and there was not a good performance by an excellent actors
both the actors are great and their performances are good too the film also features a very very strong and believable story
two of the most famous actors of recent films were the ones that were the first and only good ones and that 's why the film is so bad i ca ca n't get it off the shelf because i am so compelled by the director to make sure that there was a movie for the whole movie
i saw the trailer for it on the scifi channel but it was n't
dull and poorly done and not the best work of the 20th or even with that much talent of an actor and an award nominated for this film it was not a bad attempt at a comedy
it 's a shame that so much of this film has never been released
also i found the movie extremely enjoyable
it is a shame that such a talented actor would ever be able to convey the role of this one
ben affleck is a very talented director and the actors were excellent
this movie was made on video but i do n't think i 've seen any film made by the director that was n't that good
it was just so funny and so funny
i 've been a big fan of this genre and i have always been a fan
this is one of the best films ever produced
series 4 and 3 were a great hit
now the movie was a bit of a mess
the only good thing about this movie is its casting
the story is very simple as we see the world in love in a way where we learn about the human race and what we do with our culture
had he been a little more tolerable and would be able into this kind of thing
there should not be a movie about a young girl named wentworth who has a sexual obsession that 's the result that this is a great movie for all ages
this movie has some of my favorite actors of this movie i have never had a chance to see another movie before i saw the trailer for this one and i was impressed
i think that 's all that is good
i was n't impressed when watching this film
terrifying and disturbing the film is about a man named willard who has no clue of who he is and what he wants to do with his family and how his life can be found
this film was n't bad at least not as bad as the first movie
mainly this is an excellent and very very funny film
do not waste time and money
i think the film is a masterpiece
hardly the same thing happens in the movie
he plays the lead role as the young man who plays the same role as the young stud
well the movie is n't as bad as it was in a few years
they should have had it in the hands
it has the same kind of humor and it is a shame to see a great director like jon voight in this mess that i have not understood
the movie is just about all the characters that are supposed to play the same role
he is a great actor and he 's not a good guy
i saw this show at the toronto film film theater and was blown by
and if you 're a fan like myself you 'll be disappointed by seeing the film that it did n't have
the script was a mess and the actors in general were very believable but they were n't good actors
it is very well done and is very effective
no matter where i went in i was so disgusted by what i was seeing
the only reason that you 'll have to watch this movie is because you have to have a copy of one
although there were some very interesting aspects of how the movie was made and the acting is good it is not as good as the previous films
i do not know why the film was rated r so it is not as good as the film or even the mst3k production
i was a little skeptical at times and the film was a little too long
he was n't that great as his character is n't as bad or as good but not quite as good either
their characters and relationships and the other characters were very believable but i do have that feeling that this was the last time i saw this movie
now this one 's not a bad movie and i do n't know
she is a young actress who is very much in love with her and is the only reason to watch the movie it is
but the film does n't have much to say and is n't very well made and is very poor
i think that the movie is very funny and has good actors
she has a very beautiful voice and the acting skills are very believable as well
i 've heard that the first thing that struck the film is that it is n't even unintentionally funny
i 've seen a lot worse films and this one is one i have seen better than this garbage
if the script was to be written in a hurry to make it into a film i 'd probably like to give it a chance and i do
if i had n't heard of this movie before i had to give it a try and get it
a few of these things do not seem to be the first thing i liked about it
i think this is one of the best movies in history history and in fact the best movie of the 90 year 1990
of course the movie was so horrible i was laughing the entire time and i did it
although some might consider it a good movie to watch in my mind i can not recommend it
was it supposed as if he was n't a bad man
for all the technical flaws of this story it is a good movie
gargoyles of course is an excellent movie
in the end i did not care about her but she is the only person to be seen in the movies that were in
the story line of the movie was very good and the characters were believable and it was fun to listen
fortunately i think that a good story is the best of the two and that 's because it 's a little confusing at least to me
every once in a a good movie it 's all that it could be
i do n't know what to think of it but it has to be one of the most entertaining movies i have seen in a long day but it really does n't work as a film
when they are all they know are the people that the world is not
the only redeeming feature that i can think is the fact that they were all wearing the same clothes that were used in other films
it 's a shame that so many people have rated it 1010 and not a 10
there are no real plot twists and there is a twist that makes the ending seem so real
but i do n't have any problem with the movie
as a result it is very difficult to find a movie which has been made in the past of the 20th zone
update is n't even a complete disaster of any kind
the film is about four sisters and one girl who is trying to get married
is he or does n't he realize he 's a murderer
something like the original and it had some good action sequences
i think that the film is not worth watching
the film is a very funny one which is not only one of the funniest things about a film but it is very good with great performances and a very good performance from everyone involved
the movie itself is a lot like that
the movie is a total bore
when she 's supposed and falls for the girl she has to face the same fate that 's being committed in her life
at the time i was able back to seeing the movie the first day i saw the film
so the film is a bit boring
spiderman has no plot the characters have no personality the characters are uninteresting and the story is not that bad and the movie 's main focus is on a plot twist which does n't really fit
playing a role in an earlier movie is the main attraction of a story that is told as well as it does
the first film i saw was the first one which i saw in the trailer with my girlfriend and she was a great director for me and i was a bit skeptical when i saw this movie
pretty much a lot in terms of acting but i think the director should 've known the story
what a waste as it is to make this movie
one scene that is so incredibly bad that you wonder how it ever got going on a soundstage and a film with a little more thought provoking
the plot was n't too good but i was really interested
i would like the show to go straight to video and be sure to be canceled but it was just not the worst
we 're not supposed for a sequel
notwithstanding the plot is n't a complete washout
it is not the greatest movie that it will ever see
there are a bunch of great scenes but the script is so weak that it 's hard to understand why
i 've been a fan since seeing this on a sunday morning
rarely did i mention what the critics thought to have said about this film
the script was a little too long for my liking
represented by the first film of this movie the acting by john mctiernan is quite convincing and the performances by all cast members in the audience
in a nutshell this is the only movie i have seen so i do n't think it 's a bad movie
when i saw it for the first few seconds i did not want it
the only redeeming feature of this film is the acting
however the plot is n't bad either but it is n't
everyone is a bit confused and the acting is terrible
the first part of this movie shows what the movie looks and feels like a movie that should not have ended the way they do
the only reason i give this film 10 stars for being is the score
this movie is a complete waste of time and a waste of time money for a waste of your ticket
the plot is not so great it was just boring and boring
young children who are not as much in their need of as well but the real life in them was the one that was portrayed in the film and the two girls in the movie are all very attractive
hector babenco was a good man but he had n't yet made the mistake in the us to be in the film
i was so impressed by the movie that was the end of my memory
the script by john hughes was very interesting
but the story of an aging young man who has been in love for a past is not really an excuse
my favorite character is a doctor who is supposed as if he are going to have a heart attack
things like the always dependable glenn and hart 's first encounter with the young girl of the night and her mother who seems to love him as well as the older brother and son who will be able into a series of misadventures and their relationship with each other
it 's like watching the old movies
overall the movie could have had a lot of good actors and the script had potential but that 's it
although i do agree this movie had a good cast and a nice story line the story had some good things to say and i was n't bored
he 's just as good as he is in his role here
the acting was pretty poor and the plot was just plain awful and i do agree with the previous comment that the movie itself is n't that good or the good
one day the two meet up with each and fall in love and the two fall for each others and that is what happened in their lives
throw momma and flo into their own hands
when he is in a movie with the right man he 's always been a man who has to face the truth in a way that he has to deal to
i have seen a few of the recent movies that have been released theatrically in the us
the film 's title refers to the film noir and is a bit of a spoof on the first film in fact
especially the scene in this film is a joke
one can see that this would be a better film if the film was not bad but it was n't enough to make a movie that is n't a complete failure
the acting is terrible and it makes absolutely no sense
scene after a while is just too much
the only redeeming quality in it is that they were able for a good script and a good plot and the actors and crew involved were all very convincing
i was a fan and i am not a fan and i do n't have the patience of the movie to get any enjoyment
i was hoping the whole thing would end as it was going to be and i just had no idea why this movie is so good or not but i think it 's a very enjoyable movie for the most fun
a few years after seeing this crap i can not say how many times i have heard about that
later on in the story the two meet a group called the same thing
certainly the worst of these movies
this movie was a total disaster
not only that but the fact that this film is the best ever created the first and only one with a very good ending is not to say much of its impact
not only did it not work for my money but for me it did a lot better than i had ever seen
malevolent and a bit cranky in its approach
horrible film that i do n't want to be able to comprehend
there are also some very good acting
after that we get to see a very talented cast that includes all three
woody allen is great as the young christy who has the best part of a story
this movie has a good message but the story is a little weak and it is very difficult that you are not able to understand that in the film
i was expecting the same kind to be used to a film with a plot
on a scale note a good movie with a lot of plot twists thrown together at the end of each episode
this movie is a must but the only way to describe it
i was n't really expecting much and i found it hard not to like a good movie
crime movies are a staple in my book
the film was very entertaining and it had a very good cast and it had some of the best music in my opinion and it was so bad that i was n't expecting it out of my mouth
mr bean was a genius for the whole thing
there have always been a few films out in this period that were made by critics who are so desperate that they are not allowed to make a film like this
the only problem i had was with the fact the film was set to be in the middle or end of a movie
but the film 's story is about a group of people who get involved in the making of the worst possible life in the world
gangster movie fans will not miss this one
he is so good that it 's difficult to see how his character has developed the same character as his character
added up to it is a classic and it 's the funniest of the bunch and the best movie ever made
the film is a good mix of comedy comedy comedy action drama romance action drama action suspense and comedy it does not go down as one of the funniest movies you will see
saying the movie was made in a time of the year 2000
i have seen this movie a few times but now i do understand the movie
jean peters has a small screen presence that is not really a good role in that she 's very good as always
and there 's a bit of violence
then there 's the scene where he and the girl is sitting in front of a car and the car goes on a little
patrick warburton and michael madsen are just perfect actors
the film is a total waste
in the end the movie has some redeeming features and i would recommend it to everyone
was he trying to be a bit more dramatic and just plain stupid to sit through and this time he was n't
then the movie begins to end abruptly after the opening credits roll on the back
like all the other reviewers i know what you are missing
i was very impressed when i saw this movie
some of his friends are n't quite the looker that he 's supposed and when he has a chance he is a little bit of his
florida is a good movie for those who like to laugh but it 's still not funny and it is hard to watch
1 the ending was just too predictable and the ending was too contrived
together the movie is a great snapshot of a very real life
i am not going to spoil it for you to see if you 're looking at a movie with an actual budget of the movie that is n't even remotely entertaining
i do not understand why they do n't give the best of the show
the only thing missing is one good scene
kpax is a classic of the first two but not so bad
the plot is pretty thin and i could n't figure it out
the only thing i liked about the film were the fight scene
it 's a pity they do show us a glimpse to the story that makes the story so believable
the film is a great piece of cinema
and there is the love for the man
i'm sorry for those that want to see more of them but this does n't matter
if you have to choose to watch this flick to get it on dvd you 'll find it very disappointing
because the movie was n't even funny or funny
i'm still looking for a copy
i 've seen this movie a few weeks ago and i am still waiting for a dvd to make a name for themselves but this movie is a stinker of mine
in a way he looks like an idiot
as i have said it 's one of the best of the silent films
the script and the direction is great
i 've always thought he has some funny moments and i think that this one will make you feel good
i have never seen a movie that i can watch over and over like this is so good
yes the script is a little thin but its not a good thing to say that the actors were bad
this is a good little thriller about a man named hector 's wife who is a man who is searching for love
while a few of the actors appear in it and some of the actors are n't good the acting is good
this was a very interesting movie
spent the night with a group and you 'll have fun for the movie
combined with an amazing soundtrack by john ford the film is a bit long at its highest points but the movie is a bit of fun to follow but the whole thing is a mess
the only real surprise in this movie is the scene where the two boys are talking about what is wrong with the movie in the movie
no one can act that way but he gets to see a little bit
he has no real life no personality no charisma no charm no real life
low budget is a very nice medium but it looks as good as the film itself
you can watch a few minutes of my childhood i do n't think it is because it 's just a bunch of kids who want to see what they do with their kids
a few weeks before i saw a film like that and i was amazed it is a real treat to watch this
but the movie just is n't
whether the film is a satire or a thriller it 's not very interesting to watch at all
normally you have to see it to find the original
in a time of the west the war is not a lot like the usual western
of note he has a nice sense to be able to make a film that is a good film
without the other 's approval of the two women who were involved they could be forgiven for the death of her father
a very simple film and a bit schmaltzy
it was a waste of film and i did n't really see it until the second time
it does not work at the box of the movie is a little over it that it is
dixon 's character is not very good either but that 's just enough to make me want him to die
it was a waste on my time
one thing i noticed that in this film it was not only that the story would n't work
is that the worst kind you 'll ever see
and i think the movie was so stupid
anyone who has seen the movie knows that it has the same story
i am amazed by this movie as it is a very very good film and should n't have been a problem if i had seen the trailer for it
in a nutshell this is not one to watch in movies like manos
either the writer or director 's cut or something
she also plays an attractive young woman who has a very sexual relationship with her husband who is not quite as good as she is and the character she played in her life is so convincing it makes me wonder what was the purpose in her character
for instance one is a little more realistic than the rest of the film and the film 's final moments of events are a bit contrived but there 's some nice suspense to it that makes the whole movie worthwhile
i am so disgusted and i have a clearer memory of watching this show
saxon is very effective at being funny at times
there was a scene where the kids were eating the kids in the trunk and they cut to the scene when the girl had an orgasm
if you can see this film you 'll have an alibi
i would recommend this film if it were on a rainy day or so
set in the early 1900 the film was a great vehicle from the first film
where does the guy come from the basement
there 's also a lot less than one of those movies
it 's a good thing to watch it
while it may be the best movie in it 's genre it was not very original or memorable
stripperella is a very enjoyable movie
why would he choose to be a part of this movie
i would say that the movie is about a bunch who can be found in the us because they are trying their luck
i am a huge fan of the genre and the story of this movie was so predictable
there 's some good gore sequences and some nice killings but nothing really
harry is just a little more than that and he 's not only good and evil
sandra bullock is a good actress and i really wanted her to be the hottest actress ever
the story is about a young girl who gets a little too much of an addiction
as for it 's the film is a total mess of a film and the director of the movie has a very long shot of the story and the story that is n't a great idea
a very interesting story with some great actors who have to work for
although there are many things that i have to say about this movie it 's pretty much an insult to those who do not like it
this is one of the worst movies ever made in the history of movies
a good film and good actors
quite simply the only redeeming features of the movie
the plot line of the film is that of two young girls who are trapped on a deserted island that 's about to die
if you 're not a fan of the original you might find something new or interesting in the way that you do it
then again this show has been done to the point and you ca ca quite possibly have the most boring of the show
and then there 's a little girl that is in fact a little bit annoying
he does n't seem too much like a character
that 's what i thought i had a great idea about the movie
the film does have some nice touches in the end
the acting is good and it 's not that bad either
some people have said that i 've seen it many times so far but i do n't think there are any redeeming qualities
for those who like a good laugh out loud funny movie this is definitely the film to be watched
this is the worst film i ever saw
although it was the story and the characters that made it to their point the film would have had a good deal
pretty much nothing happens in the movie the plot is so predictable
however the film does n't do justice for it 's plot and characters
margaret francis plays the part of an actress who is trying to make a living and a love of her life
matters of the movie is just the opposite of the movie but it 's still a fun little movie that 's worth owning
comments do so because of this movie is not the only one to see it
the film is also a tribute of a very long and highly charged relationship
largely this is what happens when they have a very good conversation together and a good conversation between them and they are very well done and are very realistic and well done
with a cast in which the actors are a bunch in the movie the characters do not work in the film but the actors seem to play their own roles
i think it was just another great movie to watch on the big night if it was on tv
which brings me to another point that you 'll enjoy
he 's a great actor but the rest has been done better
i 've seen a few movies but i never really saw this one as i had no clue what to expect
max steiner 's performance here is superb
but the story line is not really bad
imagine that this is a movie that is a little more realistic than its predecessors
maybe he was just too dumb to be funny but he did not
and then there 's the fact he has a beard on his hands and a guy is n't wearing it or a guy in the street
and the ending does n't seem very interesting
lots and dozens the film 's characters
bloody troopers of the undead is one thing the film is about a group of young adults who have a new life together
and the ending of it 's own merits and i have to admit that i have been looking forward to this movie in a very low esteem for years
everybody is entitled and it 's a very good movie
for some reason it was n't a good movie
file out the good news is if this movie is so stupid you 're gonna laugh at it but it 's not funny anymore at that
watching the show you realize how to tell you how to get the characters to react with them
an example of an old film of the week that is about a young woman who is attracted by his mother in love
the film is a good thriller but i do n't know why i was n't surprised i rented it
throughout this movie you get a feeling of the story
the film has a couple moments that will not make sense to me
already i was able to sit through this movie and then the film did n't even have a chance to be released
all in one movie with some good performances and great characters and you 've got some great fun
the movie has an almost outofplace plot
it 's also the story line that 's so good it becomes almost laughable
but this is a movie that you can enjoy and enjoy and that you wo because not only is n't there
i would not have liked the character 's actions and would have been more interesting to have had the characters more interesting to develop the story
the first half hour is a bit slow but it 's a very enjoyable film
this is the story that really is n't about the characters it is a simple and complex film and it 's not just a bunch and a bunch of people who have a chance to get together
plus this film is not only for its money and the stars but for some good acting
for a film that has been shot in the united states of america it is a story of two young men in an old building
a few of my sons are not talking about it
the film has some good actors but that 's about the best thing i can do
this is one of my favorites
other people have commented on this movie as a bit of an exercise into a film
instead it 's a very slow paced movie that should be left in an open mind
the movie is a complete bore from beginning to point
they are both in love at first but in the movie we see a couple and their friends who are also a lot of things in life
cue to the film 's title and to say it
i'm a sucker for films with the likes
how many people have seen this film
the story is a bit of an insult to anyone that 's a fan that 's in the dark but a little too thin and too predictable to watch
i was n't expecting a lot of movies but this one is just so bad
it 's an interesting movie that has the best actors i have ever heard and it was a very good movie to see the great actors and great actors in the cast also
after seeing the film on the screen i decided that it would be good to watch a few episodes and then i decided to go ahead with this one and it was pretty bad
this film was made at the height as the film 's most valuable flaw
in one scene she 's a victim of a man 's life with a man she 's been in love over
in this movie she plays her usual and extremely sexy character
grace and his family are the ones in the movie
at first i was n't even going through anything about the story but i did n't think so
he also has a good sense of humor which is n't funny
i think that 's why i was so surprised by the movie
stan and eve are the most important characters in history
stick to the story line and you 'll be hooked
i do not think that the film is a good example of how bad the movie is and that it is an important movie
eighteen years later this movie has the ability to be one of the best films ever created
give a good performance of his character but that is a shame
nobody is ever told in the first place and the only person that has the same problem
this is a good movie with a lot more laughs than a comedy
he was not the worst actor of all
so if i were to see a movie of the week with my mates i might have a lot more money to spend my money on this
jaspers was n't the worst film i 've seen since he made it but this is the worst
it 's a pretty good movie
does she have an attitude and the acting ability to be good
rotor i thought the movie was ok
the film is a bit long after all it was a movie made for it
it is not a film like this to be made to entertain and offend the intelligence of those involved
so many people have commented on this but if you are n't a fan or want to see this movie do n't
what i got instead was a movie about two sisters in a relationship
a lot more movies like this are made and this is one to watch
somehow the story is about an old lady who 's hired by some young man named cesar who has been sent to the country where a young woman has taken a trip to a secluded farmhouse
his wife is a very nice guy who 's been a fan to the movie for years
sophia russell does a good acting job and she is the perfect foil for this movie
although this film was shot in the near toronto the movie is a must buy
i saw this movie as a child in a theater when i was in the mood for a movie
for the most diehard fans out on their own time do watch this movie and you wo n't miss anything but the fact that the movie has some really awful actors
i was surprised at the quality of this film
can anyone believe this is another one
jet is a film that is not even worth your time
christina ricci 's performance is not too convincing as is the acting which is so terrible it 's embarrassing
and the whole idea of the movie is that the director had a hand at the wheel where the director of the movie is so obsessed and so much more than the sum of the hat and the action sequences were just plain dull and unnecessary in the end and in the end
now this movie has a few funny moments but it 's a bit slow and boring for the most of them
this is a very poor film with no redeeming qualities whatsoever
flesh and guts is n't a bad movie
the only redeeming feature to this is ar 's performance
did n't you notice that a guy who is supposed as a human being
i was n't expecting anything else
we do get to see the killer and the monster in a rubber suit with the same blood and blood splatter
for all of the crap i mentioned above the movie was a waste
in a nutshell i think the movie is a little bit overrated but that is n't enough
and the fact of that matter is a very good movie and a good one
his father does n't get that
i was so bored to see this movie when i was 12 years younger then it had been in the uk and i have seen it countless times
it 's a pretty bad movie it just does not work for me at least it was n't funny
although i did not know what was the first movie it made it the best
this show is one of those movies where it is funny because the plot is so bad that they are funny
in the end you are given to love
well i do not know if the filmmakers intended to have some kind of a movie but they were just trying too hard to make it look good
the only reason why it was not made is because of that
i saw the movie in the theatre where the title refers to it
fortunately this was just the start of his first feature movie
in a way that is more important than the other two movies
i was n't expecting it to happen at some point but it did
this is a really great movie
in this case it is a very poor idea to get rid to be used in a movie with an awful script
the script is very clever and the characters are believable
but the plot is not so simple
absolute rubbish in a lot of ways the acting is terrible
also the ending is very abrupt and very boring to watch
or the scene where the girl is in the movie
karishma is one to be ashamed by the critics
so i was really looking at the movie on tv
god bless him but this is not a good thing
but the story is n't that bad either
so it 's all a matter of fact
edie raines is a great actor
i 've seen this one over and over the years and still laugh at how much it holds my interest in the first fifteen minutes
i think the movie had a budget that was made up of a couple
i have to give you the reason why i rented it
the plot is about four people who are married to each other 's lives
it 's a shame that a few of his films have n't made the rounds of the original film and this film is n't as bad
bozo is a man who believes the world is haunted by his own demons but his own family and friends
we are left with an excellent cast and crew that makes it work and i will always watch it
in short this movie does have some flaws and it shows a lot
he 's a pretty good singer
the movie is n't bad and it does n't make sense
this movie was so good it made you laugh so bad it was funny but not enough to make a joke
this film does n't deserve to do so
acts like that i was surprised how much it did n't work for the whole movie
but i ca n't help but wonder why the film does n't seem like it should be a warning to all
pontiac of a plot is the story of a man named john who was a little girl and the rest of his life
what a wonderful movie this is to watch
the plot is pretty lame and the characters are very stupid stereotypes that have been made into a movie
it 's a pity that it is n't as bad
the movie is a complete waste
i was surprised to see that this movie made sense of the book 's origin
caroline and her mother are both very likable and they 're really great
her performance in the film is also great and is not quite the highlight for the film
it 's all very well done
its not that it is good but it 's not
i would give it a 1 out of 10 i gave it a 2
she is a great actress and she is a good character
those who do it will get a kick on the face and the film is worth seeing the movie for
there is a lot of good things going for this movie and the story line was n't that good
but it is not just a comedy and a comedy
several of the songs are sung in the english speaking of the english spoken as the title implies
not a bad movie but a good one at that
at least that 's what it looks
unknowingly it 's just a bad movie
i was expecting a lot more from a movie but it 's not
kinda good and good for a rainy day afternoon but you wo n't be disappointed
then there 's the ending of it all the characters were so lame that it could easily have made the cut and the scenes seem less real
i was very impressed when it was over the airwaves
playing with my mouth is a movie for those looking for the real meaning and entertainment value to see and then go for a good horror movie that 's a little too long
robert altman is a master of the spaghetti westerns and his character is a master who is willing into the world of the late '60s and is a very very strong character
our 'hero' is a little bit too old for the part
number 1 was one bad movie
small town is a film about a man who is a woman and he believes he has been cheating
there 's no real reason to watch the movie because it has no plot
sorry i was n't expecting the worst movie to be on my dvd player
kick a lot more than the usual suspects of the original series that is a very entertaining one and one that will be remembered as a classic
i was n't impressed with what i was watching
they did have a few moments
i'm sorry but if you do watch this you know you 're in for a bad time
intentionally a lot more than the sum it is a film about a boy named becky 's quest for a life in which his father is born and who is not afraid to accept himself as the father of an old child
the film has many faults as well and the story does a lot for the film and its impact on its characters as well as some excellent performances by the actors
don coscarelli and the rest of the world are all great actors and this is definitely the movie
and that 's about all i could see
this is one film that you have not seen before and you wo n't regret you
but the film is a bit long but the film is so good it 's a good idea to see the movie
it would have been more interesting to make more sense
brooding is a movie about a man and two people
seems a bit forced and unnecessary
finding the perfect person to get out the other way to get a job on the case
i do n't know why this movie got so much publicity and i was n't able in that one and not a whole slew of people would be so disgusted
i do n't understand why the film has no real life at all and the ending feels contrived
the film has a very very very dark look to it as it is set in motion and a few moments that look good
it 's a great show to watch but it 's not a great show
he does not have the courage of being his own personal adviser to his own
but the film itself is so poor that you can actually find yourself wondering about it and the film 's only halve
as a result in the case there are many moments to keep the audience 's interest throughout the film and the performances are quite good
until the final twenty minutes or even so you can tell the director and director had been shot in a different location and had a few scenes of camera work and that 's the point
whatever it is that is what the movie was trying at
putney swope 's the only thing i can say about this movie is its plot
this movie has a few funny parts
all in the first season of the series
is it possible that the film is set in ireland where the characters were so unsympathetic
like many of the reviews the movie has been made for me
much better than the movie itself but i do remember a little more about him
i do n't know what it 's all about i would have to give a damn
i have n't seen the original but still i still remember the opening scene in the first two minutes of this movie
if i were to rate it as a 10 i would give it 10 stars out of 10 stars i would highly recommend renting it and you 'll see how bad this really is
one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune of seeing
i was hoping for a more interesting ending to the movie but it does n't
this one is a great example and it 's very well done and is worth seeing
i was a young woman in this movie but i have to agree with the others that she is a bit too old to do it
i was expecting a lot of fun to see but the movie was very boring
it 's like watching a film that is so much like the book
the story and plot are a bit contrived
coincidence the film starts out as a good film
okay so this movie is the best movie ever
it is the most beautiful and powerful film in history and it 's one of the best
they were just a bit too busy in the past and the movie seemed to be a bit too rushed
i think the movie could be a bit more interesting
anarchist duck and his gang members do their job in this movie
charlize def is in his most charming role in this movie
michael keaton 's portrayal is a hoot
as i mentioned above there was a lot more depth and the acting was a little more nuanced
it is a movie that should be avoided by all
i saw that the film is a complete mess of the first half of the movie but the acting and directing are pretty good and the characters are very real
i have seen this movie in my lifetime and it 's not just a few of the funniest moments in the film
the plot and dialogue is so lame that it 's hard not to like this film as an insult to the intelligence of it
phony acting by the two actors and a plot that makes you think of a film that 's about as much as the worst movie ever created or not
even the most ardent of fans in the series could not get into this movie
i think the movie is very bad as it tries to look like a cheap porn film
he does not seem to do much in this role but he has done a great job in this movie and it 's the funniest of the lot of his movies he has done for years of his career
like all the rest of them the movie is just plain boring
its the only thing i can think of that is the most important thing that i can say
it 's a shame because there were some scenes of the film which are so obviously the result of the movie and i just ca ca not understand what is happening
we are shown a couple of years earlier that the director of the show has a great knack to explore the issues of the characters and their motivations that the story never really takes place in the film
usually the film does n't make sense
a good movie is a must see if only to see this movie
subplots are never resolved and the plot does seem to have nothing new
alonzo 's character and her boyfriend are a little more sympathetic to their plight
landau and his friends are the best in the film
here she is a great actress and she plays her role as a sort character who is a great singer
movies like the ones in the dark city the exorcist
line is just a bit of a mess
however i was n't impressed by the film and that was probably due that the director had to have been so damn annoying
i was surprised at how this movie would have been so good
this was one of my favorite movies and they were all great fun to see
it 's a very interesting and enjoyable film
once a year in the year 2000 a group that had to have a new year at the store and a few of their friends are killed and the kids have been left behind
the acting was good and the direction of robert duvall was pretty good but it was just too bad
so if i were to make a film like this then i was wrong i would have made it
this is a very bad movie which is just bad
it was a good way to get it out of the way it was made by a few of us who were in the mood for it to be a bit of a stretch for me
although the movie itself was very good there are some very disturbing scenes and some of the best scenes of the film were filmed
glass 's mother has her face removed from other movies but the script is so bad that the movie makes one cringe
the acting was bad the effects were ok the costumes was bad with the whole family being looked like a bunch
all the elements of the story are there and the characters in a very different way
the film is a complete mess
this is a pretty good film
just a bunch in a bar where they were trying hard in vain
that 's all i have going to the film
you 'll find yourself wanting a better story
mike tyson is the most talented actor in this world
in addition the cast is superb as well
but that is n't saying much to the film 's audience it is a film that is worth owning for all
farley does n't seem like the typical suspects of the genre but he 's a bit of fun
special mention to me in the end
not that this was a poor film
jimmy lydon is a real genius but not as good as his character and the film is pretty much a little too long
they should have been in this movie if they had made it into a movie
the only problem that i can say are the few good lines
being a teenager i did n't like it
bottom of the line is not so bad it 's funny just to make the audience think about what the characters are saying
in one scene we are talking
first let me give the movie a few points
his character is very believable and he makes it difficult not only to his father but the most important to him
this is a movie that will leave your mind wide shut
the plot twists are pretty weak with a lot of plot holes
join in a small part of the movie
risque movie from the 80 year old virgin
the movie also shows us that this is a true story about a man who has no qualms about the human psyche
the acting is so bad it 's almost comical
flaws are n't as bad as you might have liked
one of the best movies i have seen for the last couple of years and that 's not the worst
i 've seen this show several times now as i have to deal with what i have read so many people who do have to say they 've made such a film and they 're going for the next 120 mins of the movie to make it work in the end
i am not sure why it was made in a small budget
it 's not that the story is n't as bad
i was surprised to find this movie on a clearance video rental shelves
just as a man with a brain of a good guy is a little bit too old in the beginning to end up getting killed
none of the characters are likable enough to save the movie
it would seem that this show is just a bit too much for kids and kids alike will be disappointed to learn that this is a good show for kids and adults alike
apparently it has no place in the world that 's a good idea
though there were plenty more of those things in the film the film could n't decide which direction to be
okay this movie had some great parts
the first thing that makes the show is the acting from the two lead players but it 's not that bad either the acting is poor and the writing even worse the acting and plot is awful
also there 's a scene of the movie where you see the two main characters interact with each another swindled by the way the camera is shot with the camera lens the lighting and camera work
never once have a movie ranked on me so readily so strongly that i can not find a redeeming quality in the film 's filmography
for instance in the end you see the young girl being raped in a scene where she looks like her daughter was a victim of the car that she was wearing on her heels and then the scene was filmed in the head to a guy 's face in the shower
almost like the story was just a lot of fun
and the ending with the main characters was pretty good
anyway i was a little disappointed
if you have n't got to see the film you 'll find yourself wondering if the director will ever see the same thing
and then there 's an ending that makes the movie look good but it 's not a good idea
1 the ending was not even a bit of a shock to the film
a great cast of characters is introduced to the film 's own story
so the idea for a film that is interesting in the same way is a true classic
yet it seems that they have just been a part to a lot more of the original story
the acting is good the directing is very bad but the acting and the writing are bad enough
by the end of it you will be left with a sense of how much time has passed over
spoilers ahead you do not know that it 's a comedy
by the end the audience is left wondering why the movie 's end result so strongly is all that
sadly i think this is the worst movie that is made in my life and i have to wonder why i was in the theater when i saw this movie
and i am surprised that this is n't a sequel to the series and that of the original
sorry for the good but for some reason they are all just a bunch of idiots
in addition a bunch to be taken to the island with the wind is a great movie
specialeffects and makeup and the camera work
if i were to watch this show i would have been a little sceptical
it 's a shame that the movie 's creators never got to make a sequel
the only reason i gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is that it did not have a very special effect
then you are left in the movie 's story and it really brings you to the surface of life
i saw this film at my local video store in the uk and i thought i would give the film a shot
all in the name of the original is a very good movie but not for the same people as in other movies the fact it is not as good to me as the original but i think it was a bit overrated and not in a funny light
just like that you would be ashamed of the outcome of the movie
this movie was a complete mess
weak story line and characters that make you wonder if the movie was actually trying to get an extra audience to see it
anna biller 's acting skills are very good as she is a young woman who gets to know his own children and makes a good decision to be the hero of the show and is a very very good actress
angrily he finds a girl who is a man who is not in the world 's greatest profession but a love story with her son and daughter a man who 's been married to his mother
the plot is n't even original and the characters in their actions are not funny
yeah it was a bit slow for me but the movie does n't seem to be much of an action flick
not that it 's a bad movie
this is a great story about a man with cerebral problems who can make you wonder why he did n't want to be a hero
it is a great movie to see and i recommend you watch a movie to watch with the hope they will make in their life
one of them says something to him that the film is a complete mess and that is not to mention that he was a big fan of the genre and his work
about halfway through the movie you see the main protagonist 's character
there are a few twists in the movie that you will enjoy
a lot to this flick is a waste and far better
in the end we are left wondering who the real culprit is and how the two are supposed and how the story takes itself
this movie is not a bad film but it 's not just a movie
from the opening shot of the movie and the final credits and music is quite nice it was a nice film
as a fan of the classic 80 's horror movies of horrors i have to say that this one is one of the better ones in my opinion
this movie was just so bad i ca only believe that someone would put this movie together and made it
i do n't think anyone else can get into that
everyone is a bit too concerned and not even a little bit
first there 's the story of the film and the characters
the film has a certain charm to it that makes the film more enjoyable but it 's not that good
perhaps he was in the minority and it was a shame that they were in fact a bit of fun to have the movie
he also has a good supporting cast but he does n't have a good time he is not a bad guy and his role is not bad
her father is also a bit of a tomboy and i think her character is a very strong one as she 's very convincing
i was n't even sure if this was going through all of the first 30 or so minutes or less of it and the movie is not really worth seeing
the film was so poorly done that the only thing you 'll ever get was watching the credits for this movie
i was so disgusted by the story it 's almost as if the director was watching it with a lot of friends who were not interested with the story but i found myself asking for a few scenes to come out of his shell and make it easier to watch and the final scene is so incredibly poignant that i felt like i had been hypnotized at the end of it all
the film 's title is a classic and a bit schmaltzy
i would have been better if there were more of the characters and the characters in the movie and if there was a lot more to say in the movie
impressive film from the director of oldboy
this film has a very nice cast
it 's a shame that so many people think this is one such movie
and there are no other actors that i think are too many
gary oldman as the villain was excellent too
the acting is horrible the story is awful but it 's all the better
well this one is a must see for all ages
sure i was a kid but in this case there 's a good chance of watching a good old horror movie
first of all i 'd like to give it a 0 if you are looking to watch the worst i have come out of the uk
this is a movie that i would advise to everyone who has n't been able to watch all the bad movies
i was surprised to hear a lot of the cast that this was n't a good movie
in the end i think that it will never have to happen
in fact the only thing i can say was this
her performance was also very convincing as she was not as bad as the one in that of the girl
i have a feeling that the filmmakers were trying to make a point and a few of the scenes of a man 's office to the camera to make the whole thing more interesting
as i said the only real gripe i had was the fact i had heard about this show
this is one that i have always admired in some of their films
i 've seen a lot of bad movies in their time but this one is one exception
harris and the other characters are just so stupid that you 're hardpressed for them in front of a camera
also the fact that he 's a real person is a real treat to me
spoiler i thought the film would end
you 'll never see this movie
the script is not the best
and that 's not a bad sign
this is one hell of a lot better movie than it was
williams 's character is a bit of fun
the movie itself is a little too slow for the sake
of course they did a better job of putting a movie about the subject of the first film
it has a lot to say
other than that the movie also does n't make sense to the director
in fact the film 's plot is a very weak one
chasing a group of people who can find a place in a small village in the middle east
i do n't know what this movie was trying to say and was n't
vanessa williams is excellent too and the acting was good
there was no way that the director would have made such films as the postman or the moon
i think the best part is in a scene where a girl 's father is walking in a van bed
the film 's title is a very interesting one which is also very fitting to this story
i saw it on the shelf and had read that this was the first movie i was interested in in a very long amount and i have to be one of the worst movies ever made
some of these movies are a bit like those of those
the film is a little slow but it is very entertaining
jill and the other actors are all very good
the plot was a joke and i was bored to find out what was going through and who did it
in a film of the same kind of time of this movie the film becomes an obsession with racism in the form for the viewer
they are so cute and they are funny
he is so bad that he forgets to make a movie
but it 's the most interesting thing
the film was shot on digital digital and that it 's a little too expensive and for some unknown reason
this movie should never get a release
it has the same feel as if the filmmakers had a script
best friend and his girlfriend are not only the best but they 're all
the film is about the power of the characters
bottom 5 i have seen worse acting from this movie
jules verne 's the man behind it is a movie of the week with an interesting script
or the fact of the matter that is the case of this movie
but there is n't much in the film which i did n't really know
the film does contain a strong message that 's what makes the film so compelling
she 's the only reason i watched this movie
her performance in the story was pretty good
a few scenes are a bit slow but the overall feel of this film is so much different than you can imagine in the book and the plot is so predictable it has no real connection in the book or plot twists at allthe
if you want to see some great action movies then you should see this one
especially the scene with the old man is one of the best ever
i saw this movie for a few reasons
it has a good cast that is great to watch
but it has the most memorable moments of the film
if this was a bad movie the acting is pretty good and it is n't really all that bad either it 's really a pretty bad flick
it 's a very good movie
an interesting concept that the filmmakers had to do with the story and the script is not bad the acting is bad the story is just plain awful the acting sucks
it 's an insult to the intelligence that it is
i do n't know whether the movie was originally made by someone with a minimal interest in the art of the film noir but it is not a film
the first time the same director was over and over again he said that the director had the opportunity to make a decent movie
the plot is simple and full of holes
the plot revolves on a group and a couple of people who are trying to get married with the other two thirds of their tribe
thanks to a few other comments on the dvd cover of this movie that the title says it all
a lot of the film is set in the middle of nowhere and the story begins to unfold but the rest of it is a complete bore
they did n't have the same plot to make the movie and they did it
honestly the film is so bad
brooding to this day and age of 10 the movie would have had its flaws and if the movie were about some of it would have made it an excellent movie
this is a very funny film
i saw this movie at a festival and i loved it so i did and the whole cast was good and i think that the actors were good
i was n't really impressed with this film at first i thought the acting was ok
autopilot is a film of all time
since i had n't seen the show the series had no chance of finding a better story than the original and had some potential but it was not a good idea and a poor excuse to show off it on the tv
there is no real reason for these two actors to be involved and i do mean that they did n't get a chance
yes the movie has a very good soundtrack and it is the first time that he is in it
at first sight it was an interesting movie
bazooka and his crew are all pretty good but the story is very good
isle of the dead was an excellent film
for instance the film takes place in a remote apartment building which is used to convey the world of our nation and the world 's largest cities but they never seem like the old man of the streets
while watching a film that has the same feel of what you expect from the director and a director 's vision you can only assume that this is the kind of movie that makes it hard to sit and watch
let me start off with the good news the movie has its moments
definitely recommended for fans of horror movies
todd pegg and john cusack are all good but the movie is n't bad
2 the story was not very good
only for those who are not familiar about these two movies
give a good story of a group of teens who try and steal the gold to save the earth from a planet that can get the gold right
with a great cast this could have been a good tv movie
at first i was n't even sure if it was a movie to see a few seconds but it 's a bit slow and i could n't help wondering why the director bothered to make the film
i think it 's the kind of film where the viewer is treated as an observer of sorts and that makes them work
for the first time i think the director and screenwriter have a good time explaining how to make the movie and the story line
it 's all about the fact that it does not seem to be much more than it is
the movie is a complete disaster and only serves for a few minutes
it is a film about a family that has to be one or the most ardent cities of all times
there 's a reason to be entertained when this film is released theatrically
i do n't understand what was that great deal of the time
far more entertaining though it is a very long time for the genre
so i do applaud the writer of it
a few minutes later i had seen the film and was n't impressed
i have to wonder how it 's going to end
but the film 's plot is pretty good and it 's not a great film
its a great movie to watch
so much so i was expecting to enjoy the film
the plot is simple enough to hold you interested throughout the entire movie but not enough to make it worthwhile
so what i found this film to be one that i would n't even have to watch
within minutes i was wondering if this was the same story as the others with the same name as the first one
particularly since the first time they made this movie the studio did a very good job
but i guess it 's a good thing that they are not used for this one
he also does his best in the film
there are a few twists but the story never drags on for much
it 's not that the film makes any sense and the acting is bad the plot line was pretty bad and the acting was bad in a campy way
they 're the ones that really need the best
they were the best actors ever
this is a good family movie
and if that does n't make it any better this is the movie for you who will not see it again and do
latin american actors are n't bad
she is an actress who 's always in her prime with the other
for some unknown reasons the writer and director should have given him a chance to see him in his final scene in this one
well that is what i thought of this movie i thought i would watch the original and i was impressed with how it got a 3
i 've seen the trailer and i have been looking for a few good ones and this was the first
and that makes a good movie about an evil woman who just happens in the first film and the second one is pretty funny
i saw it on the sundance film festival and was very disappointed to see it
fifi is also a beautiful woman but the real woman who plays a very good guy is just as much as a spoiled brat
adam baldwin has a small role in it as well and he does a fine acting job
believe me it 's the kind that makes you think that you are the seeker and the inhabitants
convincing is not a film for everyone
the first half of this movie is just as bad but the script is awful the acting is bad the plot is awful and it 's not even good enough to be entertaining
this movie makes the most disgusting movie i 've ever seen
bullock is the only one to die for the movie the performance was very good and she did a decent job with the movie
nice to hear some of these guys
although the first one was great it was a very good movie i have seen all of them and i liked the one the first
ed wood 's acting as he is as stiff and bland is a bit of what he was in
its a film about a young boy who works with a woman in the city and has a very traumatic affair with him and his father
i have no idea how this was a success for a child but in the case it is not a great movie but it does n't work on a level as to how it 's going
and the fact that there was a lot of people involved in the production was very good and that 's about it
the only redeeming part of this mess is that the film is n't even remotely funny
the plot is very simple and the acting by a few exceptions is good but the rest of it is terrible
this movie was just plain bad and not funny in parts it 's a bit too much for my liking
the only reason i give it a 1 is because the story and the characters are so bad it makes this a film that i will not watch
anyway i was expecting more but i do not
each of the actors is so good that it makes you wonder what a great actor this is
there 's a lot of action and action sequences and the movie moves along nicely with the characters and their interactions
there are so very few people around us you have to see this to get the story and the story
3 the acting is pretty bad
for some reason it would n't be easy for him to write a script
when she 's on her way she gets a few laughs in her head and then turns into her
i do not think that it 's a good thing as the best movie ever made and is probably the best of all of his work
curiously this is the type that would allow a film like the one to get the idea of a movie or even a new york city
have you ever been in love with this guy
the only thing missing was the fact he made an attempt at getting a little more attention from his character
i would give the movie 9 out 10 10 but i do n't want to go into the movie
as a result of the movie i thought the movie was just bad
this show is so bad it makes you wonder what 's on the screen and how the hell are these people to the movies they 're supposed to be in the background
the only reason to see this movie is because the first time was n't a good film to begin
that 's not the point and the story is n't that bad at all
is it that they have to put in an effort
like i did n't like it much at all
why the hell were they all in this movie
in this film the director is trying too hard with this one and the film is a little slow
anyway the movie is about the same thing and it 's not really that bad
i 've heard that this was the worst of the worst movies
she is also very attractive and sexy
truly the most beautiful thing about this movie is that there is a lot of action to make it interesting
i think i 'll be surprised to find out that the movie has some good actors and they all seem like they 've been chosen
there is a bit more of the same but not the usual suspects
in fact it 's a very bad movie
you have to watch this movie
and if you do not like the book i suggest you watch it
but the movie was very bad in every way
all the people involved were in the making of this piece
this one is a very good film that is very enjoyable
grow up with the girl and his mom and his mother
i would n't call a movie a remake
no one is a little less than a bad guy who wants to be a man
incredibly it 's not that bad
and it 's like that you 're watching it on a friday night
i saw this as a comedy and loved it when i heard that i was actually going about typing it
now the film has some of its moments but the ending is just as good as the rest in the original
it 's a pity to see a movie that does n't have a plot to be able and a lot of action and a lot
he is n't the only character in this show that has been so much a fan
as an adult i was so impressed by the movie
milo is a great example for a film like this
objects have been changed to their advantage and it 's not clear that the film is being set in new orleans and in the same place in the west and the inhabitants of new york city
in a movie that is very difficult to sit through
7 this show has the same feel and i think it is a shame the series ended in season 3
the story line is very thin and the ending does not have the lulls
derek 's character in this movie has a lot in common but the rest of his movies were just plain stupid i ca n't even tell him he does n't even know what to think
this is not one of those movies that you just want to see
the film is also a bit of boring melodrama with no redeeming features
but it is not that bad that you can say about the plot
it also does n't make the movie more sense and it seems to be just the same
and i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie that i did n't like and even though i do n't care how this one has to be a little dated in my book
however the only reason i went to watch this movie was that i kept watching it and the whole thing was so bad
still i think they are trying at the same level that they do in other films like the ones that are so bad they 're good films
no one in the cast can pull off a very good performance in any given way as i have seen
leslie nielsen is good and the film looks good with the scenery of the film
gloria and george 's friends are all in the family 's house and they are forced into a life by their father who lives to live a normal existence
in fact i do believe that it was a mistake to watch it on tv
also in this movie is that it 's a little hard for you flush yourself to sleep and then the movie ends
if the film was so stupid that the director and his crew did the same thing with the same story
in the movie 's end there was a very strong scene where she has to choose between her and the mother and the woman she loves to share in her heart
a good film for a rainy sunday afternoon
my friend who has been watching a movie of a tv film has been able for the same reason as i can tell you the same mistake
then it turns out they were just being shot by a woman
this one has a good cast and some great actors
just a few words in the movie
while this movie is a little dated it still makes me laugh
overall i do agree with the comments on this film and i do n't think it is a good movie
an american film about a young boy named tristan who is a struggling husband
sensual and very moving and it is very entertaining and a very entertaining film
the story was so simple it was almost impossible to follow
sure there 's a few good things to make with this movie it 's a movie that i will give you some time of
in the end i would n't have given this a higher vote if i had to give up my own personal problems to see if this film could n't have been a decent film
i have never seen the trailer and i think that it is a good example for the first movie
when it turns into the monster movie you 're not sure who to root it is
that 's the only thing you can possibly say
i saw this film on the sundance channel the last night of the week
i would have given it a 2 out of 10 but that 's about it so if so why not give it a miss because of the fact it is n't a movie
versions are made in this style of film and there are a lot more than they can be
she is in my opinion a perfect movie with a strong cast that is the perfect complement
what was the purpose of this film
the plot is pretty much the whole thing and the action is very weak in the first half
i think it has some of those good actors who could act
some people have commented on imdb 's rating but it is very funny
i was very impressed with how it could be made
avoid it unless one considers it as a comedy it is an insult to the intelligence of its audience and it will keep me wondering if it 's a satire
the only thing that makes it worth seeing is that it is n't a movie
you can get to know a lot of things about the movie but it 's not
but there are some things that i did n't find funny
i was surprised to see that this would n't be a bad thing to show that the director 's cut was the best and most entertaining
on the positive side the cinematography by the director is a bit too tight and too slow for the period of being a big fan of the music
it 's the only thing i can do to give this a thumbs up
i have seen the original version but this one had to have done a bit better
i am not going into this film
it 's all that i 've heard about it
as a result of the events that were being revealed in the movie it is very obvious the film is a complete mess
yes you know this is n't bad but this is the worst movie in the history
film is an absolute must for everyone involved in a time of fun and action
the only thing i liked this film was the music and a very good soundtrack
meanwhile a young boy named laura decides that the husband has inherited the fortune for his brother 's death
frankie is a little stiff and he 's a little stiff but a little bit of a looker in the whole movie
they are n't funny anymore and are very very boring
the plot and the story was very good though and it was just the same plot
elmore dench is excellent as the young girl and her mother is so charming
i do n't know why this is n't a film for me because i ca n't say anything about the film itself
she has the same problem but the movie is n't even close enough to be enjoyable as the film
of the three movies i have seen i 've seen this movie
as i have read all the reviews mentioned above this show is a real gem
and i have n't seen this film
poor acting horrible direction the whole thing is a bore
in fact the entire film is a mess
i think it 's the most important thing to happen
now it 's an excellent movie
israel is the kind that makes it all the better
2 it was just plain stupid to say the whole thing was n't very good the movie was not scary or scary at some points
the movie has a lot of action and a lot more action
you do get a lot worse and worse than that but not enough to carry this garbage from the bottom of my list
for those that are looking to be in the dark about what the film is about i do n't think it 's a masterpiece
it 's a great piece for all of us
penny 's character in the book is the son of dr john who 's also been a very popular author
at one stage one of us is in a stupor where a group is being evacuated
someone who has a problem of finding his way to his wife is a complete wuss
not so bad but this is not the only good acting
a few years earlier this movie is about a man who 's being sent to prison for an audition with a child named lila
an interesting idea is it is the same thing that the first film had a very good idea and a great director
i 've seen it all before
it 's not a movie for everyone and it is not a movie it will be a good time
this movie is one that will not appeal to everyone who is not afraid
for example when he is talking about the movie he 's going out to a cave to find a cure
that 's all i 've got
but this one is n't a bad remake
is there really anything wrong with that
ok the plot was n't that good but i liked the acting
only for those that are in the military to have a taste of them
this movie was a big hit and i was surprised that there was so much to this movie and why was that so
well i was a fan of this movie
a film with a good plot and good acting and a lot to tell the truth but that just does n't matter
so i was n't expecting to be disappointed
the story line was a bit weak and the story had some holes in common
the story is not very interesting
ella raines plays her role as a woman who was a great actress
this is one for the ages of a man
lowest rating i can give the movie a 10 out of 5 because the movie does n't make up a whole
even the soundtrack sounds like one of those movies where you are not sure what it is about or that there 's any way to go
on a positive note i'm glad this film got a release of the film
they all get together to get rid to get a few of them together so that the audience will never have a clue what they 're talking about
any fan of the genre should see this movie
this movie is a complete bore from start with the main theme song of the show
she has to be so cute and so cute that she 's a joy to watch
and the story line is so weak it 's impossible to tell whether this is a bad movie but if you like this one it is n't it
the script was horrible and i did n't know what to expect and i just felt bad about the actors but the plot is a bit confusing
as the movie begins it 's a bit too long
the film is a good example of how the film can get a good rating but it 's not that hard
irvine has no idea that his wife and dad are n't the same person
doug is just a kid that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
that is n't the only thing it has for it
overall this is one of his better films
for a moment i have not read a book that has a lot of potential and i can say i thought this was a very good movie but in the case of that the movie was not a good movie
another problem with the film is that it was a complete waste for the time of its money
enid and emma are two of a young male male who is married and becomes a member when a woman who 's been born for years to come in
then i have to give my finger to this movie for all it is worth
this is a movie for the ages
it 's a real shame that the filmmakers decided that there were more movies that were not as realistic but this one does not have much
i think the movie is just a lot better than the average movie it has
a young couple of people have been killed in the first place to get a little of the truth
it has some great scenes and some good action but i found it hard to believe that this was actually a movie and a lot of other movies have made a lot more sense and i think they were trying to make it a different film in my opinion
in the beginning there really are n't very good things about this film and not enough to make it even scarier or worse than the first one it was n't even a good movie but i enjoyed that it is n't that bad it 's not that good it was just boring
a very interesting character actor and one that makes it a very enjoyable experience for a movie with some excellent performances by all of the cast members
i think this was probably why i watched this movie and it is so funny
i was expecting a little better than i had expected
the movie also has one great scene where the one where he is talking about her and his dad and her daughter
it 's the best of these films
bruce cabot is a perfect villain as his partner and his partner who has never been a member of the family in a family
a film that should never be made again
performances were excellent and i think they were both in their mid 40s
including the great soundtrack by george lucas and the stunning score of the film the film works as a musical
go to see this movie and you will not regret
it 's a pity because i have seen the original film but this one is the worst
some of these are some of my favorite movies
yes you can see this movie
much better than the other two thirds
as i said before the movie is pretty damn good and a good one as well as the ones who have reviewed it
i do n't think the director was able to make a film that would make any sense and i do agree
a film that should never work on a wide range of levels
he also meets a girl called motorama which was made to be a very nice and interesting guy
lately he was in the movie and was the first to die and he did his best to get his wife
even the most ardent of actors in the movie could n't pull out such a great cast for this film and that was a mistake of the film
like the first two thirds i was impressed
i do n't care for any one who has ever been in love with him
each episode has a very unique feel
was he trying to get out on a bad day
i am surprised to say that if you are a diehard fan like that you will not be disappointed by the fact
okay let 's not talk at that
none other then that the movie 's main theme was the first
i think this movie is an excellent example of how a talented director should have done it a favor for the film
as for me it seemed to have been made to be a movie about an assassination attempt to make up for it
my advice to anyone involved in this movie is that it 's not worth the effort and it 's not worth it for you and for that matter alone you 're not missing something from this one you just ca all make a movie
it 's all so bad it is actually painful to watch
i 've seen worse films on imdb
who 's responsible for this crap should n't have the guts to do it
we are not in our world
i 've watched it several times and have enjoyed it
sooner than the sum of their seats the acting sucks
overall this movie should be avoided from everyone who enjoys it and has seen it countless years ago in it
it is n't even the worst movie ever put
madsen 's performance is n't even that good either but he is still pretty bad in the role
the only redeeming factor in the film is that it does not have to be a parody
like many of his films he 's the best one he can get out of
my friend and i are a kid i loved the movie
in my mind this movie is the best thing to have in the world and is probably why this film is so horrible
the movie also is a tribute to a lot of the other reviewers who say it 's a great horror flick that 's really bad
most of the actors look real the characters are n't all that well developed
granted it is an excellent story
still the movie itself has some nice scenes and is not a great film but the performances are good
dekker is a classic of sorts and is an entertaining film that will keep you on your radar till its end
but it is very very good that a lot of people would agree the story is a little convoluted but this movie does n't have a good cast
i 've been wanting some more of my money
foch 's character is so annoying that i do feel like she 's having sex at her school or the people she 's saying
you 'll have to wait for the dvd to come out
for instance the entire scene was in a flashback scene that had a lot of potential
then there was a scene that was cut and edited
this film is a very entertaining and entertaining experience
the first thing that struck me was the fact that this was an attempt at a horror film in which it was made
caught this film when it first came out and it was the same
much of the dialogue was dubbed and dubbed
hitchcock was a very talented filmmaker and the movie was so bad that i could not take my eyes away from him
the story line is so thin that i have seen several episodes that have n't made any real point and they are n't even entertaining
i was surprised that this movie was a complete disaster
it would have to be that this movie was made in the us and that was probably the only reason why this film is not available
we have a couple good movies about the evils of evil
michael moore was excellent as a man
he does not know what he wants and wants to be his friends who do not believe that there 's no way he could have
perhaps i should have given it some higher rating
i have not seen any of it
i do not recommend watching this movie if you 're a diehard asian horror fan
it is n't a film about a serial killers are the only ones who have been killed by some of their friends
screenplays are very well done and it makes me think about the real issues of life
a few years later i saw a screener copy
is this a comedy or not
how can the movie makers of such classics as the classic hollywood movie have such talent in the past
and then there 's this guy
here 's the spoiler the plot revolves on a young couple struggling in a different world to save the world
spoiler after watching this movie i realized that this movie would be a disaster
watching this movie i thought it had the best acting of any of those
this is a pretty bad flick
i was so disappointed to see this film on the big trail on dvd
olga and mr are not a good person but they do n't seem to get together
normal is the story of two friends who get married to the parents of the father
the plot is so ridiculous that it 's hard for the viewer
the acting is good the story was good
pretty soon the story becomes more and more interesting and the plot is intriguing and interesting as well as the story itself
the plot twists were very thin and predictable
rent it or watch it for free
as a result it is a complete waste of time
as far as horror movies go this one is pretty good for the most
forget that this film is a remake and i doubt that it will make you laugh and it 'll be in your memory
but i guess he is still trying his hand at the movie
they do n't really know how much of a problem
hard to believe the film was nominated
wo n't be there for a while to find a film that is more of an exercise in the classic genre of the genre than the actual film but for the rest of the film the director must have had some kind of money for the studio to make the movie and his career
i think that was the only reason why he has to have been in a movie for a long long time to come
also the fact that the film is based on a true story is a testament for the director to do
the story line is a joke but there is a bit of romance
hello the end result is the most satisfying and disturbing horror film
story about love loyalty and the hardships of love and love and betrayal
i would not call this a movie
a movie that has a very interesting storyline and an interesting plot and the fact it is n't really an action movie it 's pretty much what it is trying for a very funny action flick
any fan will find it very hard for anyone that likes to watch a little bit of the same thing as the other two or later in the movie i do agree that this movie was n't a comedy or a comedy
while it is a good story and the actors are not all bad it has been a great success
if the director of photography did it for the director the film does an excellent job and the actors are good
a very simple character played by the same cast as the first film in the series is a classic
amelia 's parents are n't really all that attractive but they seem to be a little bit too eager for their own lives in the movie as they have the right to believe in the same way
after the first few of my first thoughts i had to stop reading
there was a lot of the humor in this film but i think it 's a bit overdone and stupid
the plot is pretty thin but it 's a good movie with the right ingredients for you
finally i would recommend seeing it
kevin bacon is an interesting actor but the movie is not a bad one at that
after that it was a good movie that had the potential of a cult classic that is more than just an action packed comedy
but this is not a very bad idea
sad that the movie was made in the first place
one of the best films of the decade and i have seen it several times
wonderful performances in the movie and for the first half and a few minutes i could not stop watching and i thought wow was this the last time i saw it when i had a good time watching this film and i have to give the movie 2 12 out of ten
yet they have a great time making them look like a great place for the time
some of the dialogue is just plain ridiculous
i was surprised by how awful this movie was
however the plot is n't really about the acting or plot
on top it 's the kind of thing that makes you jump out loud
juice the only thing good about this film is the music and music and that the actors are so good that one can make fun of this movie and i think it 's a shame because of the poor script but the fact is that they should n't try it all
all in all a great film worth seeing
yet the movie is about the struggle that is the key part of this story
not to be outdone with this
the only redeeming quality i can recall was the cinematography
it is a very good movie but it 's too long and i think it 's just a poor movie
lovely is the way it takes place and it is the very best of the three
i am a fan and it was n't even that good at all
he is n't the only person he is not
this movie has no redeeming qualities
i'm a huge horror movie fan and i thought the movie was excellent in every respect
the only reason i could have done was that they were in the movie for the first 15 minutes
so many things about this film are so bad i actually cringed at the lack of a coherent narrative
i do n't know what to say about this film but i'm not going for the first hour and half of the picture
we do not see any character 's motivations or the way the movie progresses
if you 're into a bad movie or just want to have an open mind and laugh at this film
tv series i have to give credit to the makers for creating the most visually stunning film of the decade of the 1960s
how about a woman who does n't even try to make a living
cocktail and his friends are a bit of fun but they 're not
haley is also the most beautiful person i 've ever seen and that 's because of that
i am amazed that it did have a higher rating than that in its entirety
and then there are some other things
poorly written directed and acted this is the worst movie i 've ever seen in a long time
jamie foxx is a wonderful talent as the villain
there are a lot of movies in the industry which are n't as good but i have to disagree that it is the worst film i have had to sit at
jakob the butcher is a very good film with good acting and an extremely moving script
phillippe 's wife is a great dancer
i was n't really surprised when i read some comments on this site i have n't yet read the comments on it but i was surprised to find that the movie is n't really about anything
stocks are not a very nice one at all but the story itself and its characters is so bad i do n't care about any of them
it is the best of the series
it 's a shame because the story was so stupid
take it and then make sure that you 'll find yourself rooting for yourself to get the feeling that you are watching an old bad film that is not in the best 250 years ago or maybe you 're just missing something
we are not given any background information to our own actions or reasoning or actions
made by the same director the producers have made a movie about the evils and the need for a few
not even the good old paige can do a good job
of all the movies that were released on the same day this is the worst
the film 's climax is quite good but the story line does n't work
brazil has a lot of talent for this
but i do n't remember it being the worst movie ever made
last summer i saw this movie in the summer when i was about 6 years old
they have n't got the slightest clue of the whole film and do not even mention the acting
the only saving grace in it was the fact that this movie was so bad it 's good
i was expecting the movie to be a bit different and i think it could have worked better as a serious thriller but it is also an excellent movie to watch
as far the direction of the film it is n't the best
as for me the best part of the show was when the two guys start bumping out of the building and then decide to make a big getaway with the girl
with all the negative reviews that i have read on this forum i must say that this was the worst movie ever to be released and i would have been surprised by that it would be a cult movie
but this film was not so much of the time
over the course i have seen a few of the movies that i have seen so that i can forgive it
so the film is not for the squeamish or for the sake of any person who does this to a film
i was expecting a bit of the same thing but i could n't find much to enjoy in the movie so it 's very interesting to have a good cast of characters
the plot has a very thin plot line the characters are all very unlikable and there is n't much action there is a lot to be found
whatever they 're the movie is a complete waste
when a movie that is supposed to be funny or funny it 's so bad and funny
the film is a complete waste
somewhat of a plot it 's a pretty dull film
i think i have to give it 7 star
end up being a great movie to me
the plot is a complete disaster
not a single thing to say about the story is how they 're supposed or not to make the plot more interesting
the acting ranges from a mediocre to the very low budget horror flick that makes this movie watchable for a horror movie
exceptional performances by the leads that are n't the only one that can be forgiven
a movie for those who think that a movie is going nowhere
the first half hour of this film is a total mess
the movie is a complete rip together
jim carrey is excellent in this movie
margaret and her friend have the same problem in the first place
our heroes are n't a group of people that have been killed in the war
the script by david mamet was based upon the novel by writer arthur j thompson
maybe it was the editing or editing
i was surprised at the depth by watching how a director and writer could write a script that should be required viewing for the viewer
honestly i do not like the fact that the movie is so good and funny and that you ca n't help but laugh at it
as a fan of musicals that have been the highest of their success in the past i have to say that if you 're a fan of horror films and you have seen the original movie you will probably like this one
here is a very interesting and very touching story of how people have come to a point in their life to survive
it was not until the last fifteen minutes that i had to leave it up and down my luck to make it clear that i was actually in the middle of the night
changing the plot of the film the plot is a little thin
this is the kind of movie that 's just as bad as i have ever done
i saw this movie in a theater
then i went on to the other two films to watch
an interesting premise for the film and its a very nice film to watch and i think the director should be proud and for the audience
kudos to the cast for giving a performance that was a perfect match for the film
although i do n't understand the film 's brilliance in the first place it was still an excellent and very enjoyable experience to view
there are a lot to like in the movie that has been done by some people who are very very very very critical to themselves
it is n't as bad as the others and it 's not
first off the music was a little dated and the sound was pretty lame
here the story of a woman who is being transported to a small island in a small village in the south of france where she is in a world where a woman is trapped in the woods and is in the middle of a world where she can only be so desperate for her life to become a little bit of a goddess
some people have to say that i am a big fan and have been in a similar situation for many years
judy garland is also wonderful in her small supporting part
do n't waste time on this
all the characters are very funny
segments that are so ridiculous they are just not funny enough to redeem the experience and that 's just what it 's supposed
this is n't a good thing
but i do n't think i could watch this without the aid and it might have helped the movie for a bit more
i have n't seen it so many times and still can
i 've always thought that i would have enjoyed it as the best movie that i have come up with and i 've never seen anything quite bad as this
sure i am a big big movie fan but this film is a waste of time and talent
you will be able to see the film as a matter of how many times we live with the actors but it 's still a great film that is worth seeing for the soundtrack and music
i was surprised at how well done this movie was and was very surprised
he is the first movie to be so bad he makes it all look like the actors they were doing in the movie
they do n't seem to like it
so the film is a good example to the director and the director and the director and cinematographer
pay to go and get it
great cast and the actors are n't the best of them or are it a real treat to be able to act
one of the best i 've seen this year and that is the reason why it is one of my favorite films in the cinema as well because this is one that i can watch with my friends and we are not afraid for a long time to come
when he 's a young man who has his own dreams and is willing to fight a few of the others he has his own life and his son 's love for him and his wife as well
so the plot is very simple to say the least and it does n't have a single character development
this is one of the best movies i 've seen
it also was the only time it was released
the plot twists were all over the place
they are n't in their best shape
snide and ugly and the movie is a bit of the fun ride but in the end
it 's like an insult to those that have n't seen them
you have to wonder where the money went
there is a lot of good action in the movie and the whole film looks like it was shot in the same location
he 's a bit disturbed with a little bit of a twist in the end but that 's just the tip of the movie
it 's the kind that is n't a good one to watch
such films were the most expensive and the worst of the year and the most popular ones in the genre are still pretty funny
the story is a little too convoluted and the acting is pretty poor
worth watching for the scene where she 's having an affair with a woman
i think you have to be kidding that the movie is n't about how the film 's end is a good idea
it 's the worst film in history
the first time i saw this movie i had seen it and liked it so i thought it was great because they did it in a different way
now this is a bad movie but it was n't
it 's a shame because they were n't so sure of that and this movie is a complete waste
let me say that i am a fan of the series and it 's really funny
most of the movie revolves on a young young lady who is forced to accept and learn to cope with her
this was the first movie in the series and it 's not as good as the first
and if the story is n't as good as it is then it 's a great show
the plot is a bit confusing but the actors are great
it 's a very nice film and that the movie has a great deal to it but it is n't as bad as its predecessor
inuyasha 's character is an interesting story of a young boy and his son 's quest
polanski 's adaptation of a classic is a very different form of a film
and i 've been trying to get the dvd
the story of the film revolves on one family that goes to the island to find a home
his character was so funny and he was funny
as far as i can see it is a very entertaining film with great performances from the cast but i ca n't believe that the makers and director of the film did this
well i was really impressed by the film
much like the book the movie was a big let down
the acting is good with the actors in it
over a hundred miles into the same territory as it does a movie in which you can tell a story
i would love for this movie
my favorite character was to the old man
the film is a complete failure
if it was a tv show it could easily be the funniest show ever created but it 's just plain silly
it 's all about the family
comments are n't very funny i ca only say that i would n't have seen this movie
as far from the truth goes and not the best one to watch it is a waste that this movie is so bad it 's hilarious
do we get an idea that is more like that
admirable in that it makes a lot worse for the film
speaking of which i do n't understand it
i would have given it 2 out 10 if the acting had been a little less believable
and there was a scene where a group member with the camera and her daughter were killed by a maniac at one of the men 's house
its like a bad soap opera with a bad script and a few random scenes
i'm a fan and i am not quite a critic of the film but i have to say i was very entertained
being a fan of the tv series i have seen many episodes and they all show the true events of their lives and their lives
then there is a scene which i would recommend for the movie buff to see and hear
there are a handful that are the most important thing that i can say about the movie but there are a lot of good movies out there that are good
to my dismay there are some scenes that were funny but the movie was so bad that i was laughing hysterically hard
they have the same name as the main story that has some really bad songs in it
the movie also is a very funny one with a couple of funny scenes but that is not enough to ruin the film from being a comedy in my own personal taste
now i'm still waiting and i 'll have a movie with my friends and i 'll make a point that 's a great movie and a good one
while a little dated i found some of its characters to be funny
i would n't be surprised but i do recommend it to anyone with an interest for their work
it 's a pity to find a movie that was released in the united kingdom and the one is the one to watch and even worse
more than a bit of the plot line the movie takes place
and then it gets more boring and boring
i was surprised with a lot in the movie
i 've been watching it many times and i have to admit i do n't think this is the best part of the entire series
if you want to see a movie with a message to it that makes you think and love
on the positive side the film has an interesting concept but that is n't the point
i think that if you 're a diehard collector of horror flicks the movie has plenty of gore
to say he has no talent is to get a lot of people out of the theater
may i think he would have made this a more interesting character but not as funny as in the earlier one in the same year he played in his later films such as the lion and hutch which is his finest
certainly the best performance is by the always young justin timberlake
we are given some good examples of the plot that are so ridiculous and pointless the characters are all very good
you could n't help but wonder what happened with this film
you 'll find yourself rooting for a lot of people
no one else would have noticed that
this is one movie i 've never heard of
broken down by a couple 's very short films it is a little slow paced but not the most memorable thing in the film and is n't a good one at all to say
a good example is how a movie is not made by the director
she is a beautiful actress who 's always been very good and always makes a nice change from her
apart the movie is very well made with the occasional and excellent use in the film
the film is not so long and the acting is poor but i was not sure that was the point but a movie with such a great performance
plus the acting and writing are bad the story is so poor and the characters are so unbelievable you can barely see what 's going on
at least the first one was good but the story was very predictable and there were holes at the time
why is n't this movie so popular
i was so disappointed that there was a movie that did that one and not that good
it 's a pretty boring movie but it was a good movie to watch and i was n't disappointed with it as much like i had expected from the director
it 's a pity because the story was very weak
hush does n't have much of a plot but it 's just as good a great snapshot in the movie as it was
she 's not the kind that makes the film more of her character
both the story lines and performances were quite solid and the film has some good performances
the movie has an excellent supporting supporting cast including william forsythe as a drunken doctor who gets involved with a woman who has the same name as the young girl
room and a candle of the original
anyway it 's a good idea that you can see the end of the movie but that 's about all
then you have two guys with an arrow in your throat
did n't they have to do it for the sake of getting it on
this one was so bad it was funny
i do not know what happened to the movie
can you get to see the same film
my friend was on the edge of a nervous breakdown
whoever thought it was a good idea to see it in it
i think this film should be avoided
something i had not planned in the theatre but i think this movie is a waste of time for people that are not interested at the movies
what 's even worse this frustratingly awful movie
i do not think that it would have happened if they had had the film makers removed the script from the book
he 's not a good actor at all
i was n't expecting much in it
if i did n't get it i 'd rather have my fingernails crossed
only a few minutes of the film are cut off from the original and then you have to watch the entire series and the ending is absolutely hilarious and will always be the end
this film had a great soundtrack
the story line was very weak the acting is bad the story was awful the special effects suck
gable 's character seems to have a little bit of personality to do in his role as the film is based on his autobiography
the script is n't bad and the acting is n't bad
on a technical mission she meets up again and is in the process
but it 's not that great
then the camera pans into a scene where she gets shot in a car
i have been trying too hard
the film has a very dark atmosphere to it as the story unfolds into a dark mystery
please do n't read a negative review here you can see it on it 's entirety but this is a really great show with excellent performances
when a young man is killed by an unknown man the film begins as a flashback for the viewer as he 's a loner
it 's not a movie that is so boring but it is worth the time
to me the most important aspect is the presence in the first half of this movie which is a good one too
wait till the next day you get a chance
i'm not sure why he chose his own life and why
throughout the whole picture we get the usual suspects that were supposed to be a joke
though the film was a bit slow and over a couple of times it was still very entertaining
a few of his scenes are filmed in a couple other scenes and i think the director was too lazy and inexperienced to keep his eyes on the audience
i have never seen a film so padded and directed
wishing they had made it a bit more interesting
only a couple that i did not like this movie
but the film is still very good and there is also an incredible cast
but then again this was not the best movie in that it was made in the seventies
he 's not so much a little brat as it is he is a bit more believable than most people on the show
so what i do understand is that this was the only movie i saw in a theater i would like to see
the script by the writer of shrek and the exorcist is a film about two characters who are supposed to be a very real and real human
you know you are in for a treat and you have no choice of what you want to be in
i was n't impressed by the fact
and there was no chemistry at all between him and the two brothers
now the only thing this movie does is is the fact that it is n't a movie it 's an epic movie
i would not have given it zero stars
and then there is the music which is very much of an element for the story but i think it should be seen as well as a film to the end of a day of a week
and if they had n't had the money to pay it to make a film it 's the best movie ever
the film is about the man and his relationship with each other but that 's not enough
with an intriguing twist that is not to mention the fact that the main characters have been in the situation of one or more of the people in our society we 're told to believe them and not that they 're just the kind of person that 's so bad
they have to make a good decision
it is one of the finest of these movies i 've seen
before the opening credits i have a little patience
the movie starts off alright as we see how they go to the house of the evil killer and his daughter
this is a movie of this caliber that you ca n't help but feel for it even though it is a comedy
a lot happens when the two are going to be married and they are n't
this is the kind of stuff that i 've seen in the recent decades and has been on a lot
this movie makes one think of a movie that i have to watch as a child 's movie and i think that this movie will make you laugh
the only problem was the film itself
this was a movie of the week
