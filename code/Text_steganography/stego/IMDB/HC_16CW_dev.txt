oh yeah i have noticed it to this reviewer
in this film it 's just a movie
rating 2 stars out of 5 stars
i had trouble believing that this is a good film
the movie starts with an introduction for a lot of flashbacks and then moves to a new ending
the movie is a bit of fun but as a whole it 's also pretty fun with all the good jokes and good acting the movie is entertaining enough to entertain the audience
so i guess the only difference to being the fact remains that the film was made for video
jody 's life as a result of her own past lives in the film was the inspiration for the film
now they 're getting to look at a lot like they 're doing
this is a film i would watch if only one thing in here i do n't regret that one
in fact there was no chemistry between a male and actress but the fact that her character was played out and the story line was so interesting
do n't get me far as a good laugh out loud
sounds like it cost money for this garbage it would have been good but it really made a movie
oh yeah this movie is a bit of the same with a lot more plot and less than a few lines
demornay 's character gets to be a little too shallow
well this was the worst of what was supposed to do so i guess there was no story it 's a movie about a young couple who live
if i could give the movie enough credit i would give it an 8 on the imdb voting scale
when she says the word she is the only one who knows what they 're in
it 's not that bad to look for it
here 's my review this is one hell of an enjoyable movie
it 's a movie of an era in which it was made
the movie is about the struggle between two people with whom each one 's friends or friends and family
there is plenty of fun in it
it 's a shame because they had to take a bit of money by this project
fans of the original and the great dictator and the world know it and it has it all
unlike the previous film this is a film that should appeal with many other great shows
i think that if the film is not for a bit too many viewers i disagree with you who could get the wrong message about this film
i'm afraid if you do find yourself laughing then at least there will be a few words of advice
it 's not that i have a fondness for such a great cast of actors who ca n't play a decent part on this
this is the story that the makers of a film could get away and then let them do so
for the first half hour the story takes us all to figure out what is happening and we know what we are about to learn
obviously the movie was supposed to make me mad
fortunately he was not a genius and this movie was a total waste but this was definitely a movie to show
shoot and fire the movie was n't bad it was a waste for a razzie prize nomination for worst picture of the worst actress oscar
this movie was so stupid and i could go through it in any sort of movie but it 's not very good
i think i would say a better movie than this movie
get the soundtrack on the dvd cover
one scene the film has nothing to do with that of mr peepers 's portrayal of a serial killer
enticing as a film but not for the fact that it could have been a bit more enjoyable if it were made as a spoof
it 's not funny and i liked it
the characters in this show are great
i'm sure it will be remembered for fans of the genre and the film that has a little bit more work with them than the others but as i had read the books it is not the film that i thought
this film does n't even try to give us any of the world 's worst movies that it would n't have had
the story of a group of young girls trying desperately and for a night of the living dead and their subsequent meeting is not a very interesting one at all
the film itself is not just an extended piece of cinema but the fact of it 's own problems and it 's just so boring
it is an excellent film and is one that you will love to love
ella ricci gives an ok performance although she is not nearly all that impressive
despite some of the scenes which are very long in advance the film is not the greatest thriller i 'll ever ever think of
but the script is so full that it hurts the question from what i thought
i was in awe of the actors because i wanted to know them
and i did n't think so much of them at all and that 's where what 's going in the first ten mins with all the action sequences that were in my head all to yourself
for example the director had cut a new director on the original to create a movie that was more of what was shown in hollywood the other being in color
if he does not know anything about the movie the director has no idea how to work
but it really is a good movie to see if you can watch it and enjoy
why do they keep using the same old man
they should go to the movies where they can act
by the end of this movie a group of soldiers find a cure to find their peace
you 're a kid you 're not going to love this stupid movie it is so stupid it 's so bad it makes this show seem bad and even if you do n't make it any more or less boring it does n't even have the feel of the book a lot of times
do not go this out i mean it 's like watching an american flick and the bad guys are actually really pretty bad
i had hoped a lot more if it had more than one redeeming feature for the movie
marshal frank gruber 's performance of the original is as if the filmmakers thought about the film at all costs
even though they are not the best actors of this generation the best thing about this film was that it 's a good movie
i had never heard that was in the series until my local friend came from a big city called bulgaria but he had an affinity with an old man who was in a new york city
now if this was his first movie he 's in for his part i guess he was n't quite so much as he was
stanwyck plays the wife of her son
someone has this in mind the director is trying to make an attempt to cash in with the director to write direct to the plot and then at the end of each scene he 's just a lazy immature man who wants nothing more to make sense than just the fact that he 's just a victim
refusing to say that i 'll not give a damn
i have to agree with one that this movie is not for kids and those that do not like it
impossible to believe that this movie is n't a great example it is in one aspect
it is about a man in a bar trying to get her to leave his wife who is so busy and that it 's impossible for us to accept him as much as he would of thought
he does n't care what he has with the rest of the movie
i have to say that i love a good amount
the actors look like a bunch from the other actors
the story is a great mix but is n't too bad
it is a movie about a young girl named seita who falls in a wheelchair and marries her lover
the first film had a very good ending though
it 's like he 's in a coma or a paycheck in your head and you can barely hear him saying it 's a bad sign
i was shocked by the story itself
but when they 're at the local mall they do not get to know what they want to do and why
when the police is finally arrested they are left in a car crash which is a murder attempt to get rid of them in the night
i have to say that i am not a huge hollywood fan and i have to agree with this one
williams and russell are in a very small role but in this case the director is a complete jerk
the movie is a little of a mess and should have been avoided by my girlfriend at the start but i was pleasantly satisfied because it was a true story i thought it would end
one thing i really liked was how a movie like this one did n't need to keep a straight man like ghandi
chris is a man and a girl and a man that is married to him
what was with that scene in which a girl 's boyfriend says to his wife
i would like this to give you a break but it was the only film i could have viewed
i did not want to go with my girlfriend and i would say she could act for her in this film as it is a pity i just got out of bed
in the early 90 minutes i was thinking about the movie
kevin spacey was great as a villain and a good actor but he seemed to lack any depth as he usually was playing himself with
the plot seems to meander on too long after the end is needlessly silly with only one twist and the ending is predictable
entire thing is a big disappointment that 's all i can say
they have made some good movies to watch over and over again
in the end it 's really worth a watch
good movie for a rainy day and it 's not a perfect film
the script is also a great mix of comedy and drama
was he trying to save a girl
all you can want for a movie are just as good for its age the only things you have to say about this film are those of you who feel cheated to watch
it was very good to watch the movie
it is a story of a man who is sent out to find his wife but who can accept his life in his life and when he comes up from the past he has become an expert he cannot overcome and abuse his family in a manner that brings out the courage he needs
have they ever had a chance to have a decent life they were so young
after a while the film 's director distinguishes an audience with her own problems as to herself to the point that she never actually manages to make a lick of love
it seemed to be a spoof for the first time in a long time when someone wrote these books to make the movie even lamer with all that crap i know but this movie is a complete failure and one that is just terrible
i did n't enjoy the last part of the movie and it was n't even worth mentioning
here there are no real characters or motivations except for the main character 's daughter and her daughter but her mother has a little to do with a very normal story
i had a great feeling about him and the way they were all portrayed by the way they did
there are so we 're not in this one it is just plain bad but not bad not bad
nick nolte is a fine director
i have no problem understanding how a movie in such a short subject that i have seen it multiple times to understand what to expect and that is what i think it has for me
lovecraft is an incredible film and a classic with all the usual suspects of its genre which is why it was good to see a little bit more of the same
sure some people are wrong and do not know who the people who are in this film are but it has a message and it is all in it and it 's a pretty good film as to why they were not made out to be the most bankable of the movies it 's about time to see them all this is a very poor film that should be called it
and of all that he must go through the motions with her son and his family
woody allen is a perfect director
its a movie which i can easily enjoy watching
contemporary american horror films are supposed to be horror and they are so much better in every possible way
yes i ca like them at the end of that day but it does seem almost random to me that one might actually be interested
occasionally the whole thing seemed pointless to the point where i could n't even get to watch the film again
the characters all have some interesting stories the dialogue is very strong and the dialogue is so sharp
the story line is a bit weak
sad about it the best that is there
he 's a master of the craft as the man he used to be
chuck norris 's acting is absolutely horrible as is the acting
i 've seen plenty on this series and enjoyed it
that 's how the movie ends
i do not think i have ever heard of him before
but there is also something about the characters that are not caricatures
one of my favorite shows i saw as a tv and as a child i am in the minority
just as you watch the movie the first 15 minutes are so bad you want them
synopsis of a movie i have watched as a kid that is the best one that came out of it the other being so awful
it 's a lot of the times with the whole thing going on for hours too long
it 's like a cheap documentary and it shows the actors who have nothing better on screen chemistry
it 's a good example for a good film but for a lot it 's a bit more than that but i found it hard to suspend disbelief
with an equally low score and the script was very good it was very very good
they were also pretty cool though
some of us will have some pretty fun
threat is the ultimate best thing to say on the film
skip this one and make me laugh
disney is the most talented singer of alltime and one that should have been given a proper chance to make a new director for the film industry
however when it was over and the ending of it was changed i had a pretty sad idea of how many other actors did n't even make them like
it was n't until the final showdown that she was n't in the movie
neatly filmed in a tight blackandwhite style the film does n't offer anything approaching the narrative it does not matter much more is the story of a serial killer is an unpleasant film
get a glimpse of a guy from the old west who was a bit over the top then the fact of his voice
this film is a total waste of my time unless of a curiosity that 's supposed to be about to be
if you enjoy laughing at this then i highly suggest that you watch it
this film should have stayed on a long shelf
although it is a little slow it has no redeeming qualities
i do n't care when i say that this is a bad movie i have just seen it and enjoyed what to expect
luke wilson is perfect as the captain and the villain is quite convincing
the movie starts with a young woman trying as a child in her life
this is a classic piece to a t
throw momma 's shoes and make them invincible
by watching this movie you will never get to hear about it
this movie is a complete waste of my life
right to die i had to leave and watch the whole movie
then it 's over and over again in it 's entirety
there are some nice surprises here but it 's a very good movie that will definitely appeal to anyone that has ever seen the original and with a bit of romance thrown in a different outlook of the film in a very different way
we 're so happy to see him playing a character who does n't do any other good job
this time it 's a real life lesson that 's not just a matter for the eyes of the viewers
the characters in this story are just stupid stereotypes
both films are great with the story and characters from this one
storyline lines from the book are n't all that good
veteran actress who has to have a good career ahead of her role here playing the role perfectly
the only way to go through a film is a good idea for being the case in the movie
so what i got in the first half of this flick was that in the beginning you have to wonder just why the killer keeps coming back to earth to fight the zombies but when we 're told we 're a little less than that and that we have n't seen the other in our lives yet
i would love it but it 's so much more fun
to be honest they did have an extra amount of nudity and some nudity and some pretty graphic nudity on display
there is so much potential here to ensure the whole movie is set in new england
a couple of days later i have seen it three or three years ago and was very disappointed and in its initial fantasy it had so much to offer i was shocked to find out the truth about the film but the story was a good one
but i think this is what happened and i just wanted to see this
gotta be very different for this kind of movies and that is why i think that it is
while they did not have the power to do what they had to do the story could easily be changed
they have their way but then again they do n't really have a movie to do so
we follow the story and the story and we discover the characters of the story
maybe i could get the whole town but for those people i do not want to watch it for free
it is a good movie though and not only did it make sense to me
metallica 's film was n't really the only movie that made any more of the same
in fact i really really liked the story and all the twists and turns on it
and when it 's a film it is a mustsee to see this film as a child study in a new society
she looks and sounds as old and more as the movie progressed
only the most ardent fans of this genre will likely recognize how to make this movie
they are all in control of the law and the fact the movie has its fair share that are not a complete mess of the period
the acting is a little wooden but the characters were also so interesting
grandpa in the end is another one of those that is very funny and funny
considering the fact that a lot was the most obvious of the movie i found the performances of the characters very good
the film 's premise is as follows and it is not the film 's resolution in this case
sunny deol makes a fine pair as dr wilson who was a great villain
from the first scene that i have already seen as i 've seen the original bambi 2 this one is a pretty dull film
innocent enough he finds his mother and she decides to visit her home and his dad to do the right thing
the only good parts of the film were when the characters were introduced as the one in the car and the ending was somewhat unbelievable which is n't surprising
the only thing that is good in this thing is the ending
the characters were so shallow that you could actually understand the motivations of each of their characters their actions and their lives
yes and i have seen some other bad ones where i saw it again
ironically it was released in the uk as 1984 and it 's still pretty good
i was impressed by the acting
i do n't know if this is true or not
did the director even have such fun
they do n't even try to make a movie that is very boring and boring and not really worth mentioning
the plot does have some depth
sean penn as a cowboy is perfect in the role of a washedup boxer who is torn to shreds by a man who has been sent to a small island in the woods to help rebuild the world
while the story is not very good it still is a complete mess
creepshow was probably one of the most original shows in a long lost world
the only one that stands out like i was was a guy named mr woodcock in that movie
first off let me just remember that the acting is so bad it 's hard to imagine anyone actually thinking of seeing a movie that is the most expensive and low brow horror film i will have ever seen
his father is a former businessman who has been forced to write his memoirs with him and his family
michael j taylor is a revelation in his portrayal as the lead
what is most of these movies are these movies are not
while the script was a complete waste that i disliked all this and it 's not too surprising at all times i found the film rather irritating and boring it was so predictable i found myself wishing to get my head on something for it i could have a better way of cleaning a gun and a man 's arms while shooting it in the face of a child and that 's where it 's
the actors are so great but they did n't make it to the end of the film and you would n't be happy if you had a headache
he 's a great actor and i hope the director makes another movie like this
the acting is ok the sets were very cheap but the actors were just so bad
god forbid you to be scared with the movie
it was one hell of an improvement
i thought it would be interesting to see the movie at first but then just got back from the story of a man trying to survive a traumatic death
it is a good thing to see it at its core and with some serious moments and a few twists
i 've watched several movies in my time and i 've seen so many movies that are so bad that i almost forgot what they had to say
it 's a movie with lots of action and lots
their character is also a great villain
the film has a nice atmosphere which will make a very good fan of it
the story revolves on a young girl who has to fight for justice and then the film is a bit confusing
as it was it was an absolute waste and i think everyone should see it
i am very pleased by the movie 's lack of plot or character development and character traits
he does not really want to leave the family alone
the film itself is a very moving and powerful film
making this movie look interesting on paper
daughter is a young man to the end of the movie when she 's going through the whole ordeal
enter a bunch to find a new body and the two decide for their actions that they should have been born to the devil 's death
the story line of this film was pretty poor and the actors were n't very good or very good and the whole plot line seemed very contrived and contrived
she is n't that convincing here she 's also the only female and she appears briefly to be the best in her life
anyway what makes it the best is the music score by the always excellent composer of the film and you really see that there are some very real people in this movie
the plot is that there is a twist of the book where one would expect a movie about a young man and his two sons that are searching for the right place to find each other to the contrary
and the movie 's script is just stupid
if you like the old dark west the original then this will definitely be your ticket
when this is the first of the series it was shown on the sundance channel as well as tv shows with great comedic timing
les palma 's score is a high score
the director obviously knows how they have managed to put it on the set of movies which are not as funny because they are both hilarious and are quite funny
this is a real stinker for those who like the series but the one in the series that makes the show more than is its originality and the way the story develops into something like an episode for the tv series makes it a great experience for the viewer to enjoy
i do n't remember the last time i saw this movie
and for that matter i did not have the option to see a movie by the cover of the movie i was thinking that the writer did n't get it but when it went to the video clip i thought i was going to be very impressed
there have been a number of years since
whenever i saw it first in front i was hooked at the time
if you want to see a great movie that you will get to know you have n't seen
so you have to watch some other movies that make this film more entertaining and interesting than many others
once they get to the point of their actions we learn them that are the ones that are going in and out for more
it 's a fun show for adults
soccer was also the norm of the movie as well
the plot is simple the characters all seem to go down against the evil villains while they all have their own agenda
let 's face that he and his friends are still a very attractive man
i have to admit i enjoyed it and the acting is fantastic for the time
it is an action movie with great actors
maybe this is supposed a little too hard to be true but in order to make the character a bit more compelling he does not even try as to do something like nothing
the only reason for the death scene that is to occur is the one where she tells her how she and the two boys go to bed in a strange motel
but i 'll have to agree
this was one of my favorite books when there was a lot to it to begin the first film
the first thing is the new comer 's
she 's a great actress but a few moments of brilliance are put into one character and that is only in a minor part
i am not one of the guys who did n't even know how many times i was looking to find something funny about this little bit of a classic film but i would n't be saying much as to what it is supposed by being a comedy classic a horror flick and a good thriller for anyone 's taste
i think the director was too afraid for him for taking a good story and make it good
and i 've ever seen a good asian film or a good movie
i saw this movie when i first heard about it
it could be an understatement to give it away
through the rest of the picture the characters are forced to identify
madsen has a brief role as a mexican cop
apparently there are a bunch that were n't all in my opinion and there were many many moments when i did n't like them in particular i could not stop laughing at the clock but i felt i got to see him get naked and the whole time
but i have seen so many and i do n't think i 've ever been a big fan of any film or tv series or a good story
the only thing i can say about the movie is its acting ability
throughout the movie i thought to myself that she 's one of these people with a sense of humor and she makes it a little too painful to watch even in a brief time span for the film
except the director is the most beautiful person in history
the film takes itself to a level of realism and the plot seems to take over the film
the first time that we were n't the characters we were laughing out loud at the antics of these characters we are supposed to laugh at how they 're supposed or they all were not funny anymore because they were laughing out at all they were just dry and dumb
the script was pretty lame the acting was atrocious the effects were poor
as a matter there 's a lot of movies like the shining and the shining and the movie
so much of my time is that of a friend 's family or a family member or the other kids who are not convinced of all sorts of things
even worse in the series the last half hour makes the viewer realize that the director and crew are in the presence in a different form as a whole as they are in their own home and the way the two are reunited
insert it all together and you have the chance to make another movie about the world war ii
respects them in the first film
please tell us that the film is a total failure if you want to waste a couple more dollars from the wrong people
film was released for a buck 's birthday
i do believe it is one that will appeal to everyone who does
he has to get his hands on this one because he is the real mccoy who has been assigned to die
overall i highly enjoyed the movie but it was n't that different than the original movie and even more entertaining than this
charlie 's character is really a bad guy and he was never seen
set a very few with a very good setting with the two main characters
42nd street is an excellent film for its time
indeed there is a lot more to the plot in the beginning but as it is done to the viewer it still feels very good the acting was fine and the performances by director david cronenberg were excellent and very well done at that point
then the movie is about the guy with a bad attitude that was really cool and that 's why i did
now i 'll go with this
it 's a very clever movie that the two kids never get in
certainly i think this was the only movie that showed a glimmer of hope
what the hell was this movie about about it
christina cruz as the heroine does not seem very very real
the film is a perfect combination of action and suspense as well
blatant spoilers below all the rest
there are some really beautiful scenes involving the main character that he is forced to play
but if anyone can get to know this film please stop reading the book
he has no idea what he 's doing and what the story was doing at the end when he was going for help that the president of hell did not die at
there are some moments that make you want to know about the plot but you have no real knowledge of what you 're seeing with the main characters that just make this story boring
there 's a lot here from one of my favorite movies to this movie this one
these are n't even funny jokes but the story is quite compelling and the plot is pretty funny in parts as the plot is pretty basic
my favourite part is when the young lad tells the girl he has a onenight
the characters in all sorts of ways are a bit different than that of a woman 's life
but i would n't go into thinking of that one either as a child or a person who is a fan but that does n't matter
the ending in the middle part of the movie is completely implausible
this movie did not make me laugh
if i would n't have been so bored i would have been a little worried at all i had a hard watching the entire movie
obviously the only one to do that is the fact she is so ugly in his own words to make it look fake that she 's a whore who loves her
and the movie is one of those movies where the characters are so likable
needless up the first half of that series and the film has to be one of my favorite movies of them that have been on a very good day
even in the beginning we are forced to feel guilty and sad at the end in which to leave the theatre with the possibility to be on board
the movie is a bit dull and has no redeeming features whatsoever but as an adult i am not sure if this movie is meant to be a drama
dirt 's father 's father is a doctor
joan blondell is very good here as a young man who lives with the other girl with her husband
now the movie would have to have been a hit but the two leads are n't the least bit scary
poor acting and terrible dialog make even qualify to be funny
madonna was pretty good at her job but it was her performance which did not come from her
it 's not that we need to hear about the characters themselves but you can relate to them
see it on a doublebill with yourselves
i do not agree with everyone else here but this film is an enjoyable way to pass a time capsule and a lot of fun that the film has for it
how much better the film makers could have imagined if the writer had had more of a budget for that
3 the scene where dr kessler is killed off by the evil spirit that he has no problem with which the woman has killed him for the last 30 minutes of the film
not one of the worst movies ever made
hard to believe is more of a comedy
now that was the case here in a small budget
mercenary and ice storm is a story about a man who has been cheating upon many women
outstanding cast great direction and a good score of music by jerry stiller is an unforgettable experience and a must for anybody who 's a fan
my son and dad i saw this movie on my shelf for 20 while it made for tv
oz is one such a great movie
the film also looks beautiful for the story of a young man 's attempt to be successful
while some of them are n't bad the story is n't as good
the plot is very thin and boring and there 's some very lame characters in a movie that never have any redeeming qualities whatsoever except the actors playing it and the story moves along to a predictable climax
it was just an awful movie and there was no character no development at the end
for those who like the genre this may be a good rental for you
then she decides to be a woman and does n't care for him until she gets her hands up
which would 've made it an okay movie
it is a very long way from the truth of life in this kind of thing the kind of film they should have to endure as a very different type of film or a movie
malcomb is an old guy who has not been in peril for the long time and he decides to leave town for his own family
this is a movie that will be a long long way guaranteed to be remembered as if it were just made at night
but the film is a complete waste of time that is the worst movie i have ever wasted money at
great acting great acting wonderful cinematography wonderful special direction and even a little too much
surprisingly it was only a few episodes from the first season that were very good
i was surprised that i was in the mood of the movie
faye des naa ho is the best comedy in the world
won this academy award for their performance
i do n't mean to see the movie but i did n't think it would be a good film
oh my name the first time i saw this
the only thing that bothered me the most about it was to see the ending of the story of the killer snowman the first victim being killed by a bullet that turns out to be a dead tree to the point where i found myself rooting for the croc and the zombies
c lee ermey was a very convincing actor who was really a part of the audience who was rooting when he got to die for the first time he made a great choice as a kid
the only problem i saw is that the entire movie was shot on an old vhs camera
however a few of them make the movie bearable
however i do n't think any of these guys can really act in this film
this is a must have for any film buff
it is a great movie that will never be forgotten and should be enjoyed
this is what the story of the film is supposed for
unfortunately this was the most pathetic of all
this was just another boring and stupid movie that just makes you wish you could have made a worse
the film was very slow and the ending is abrupt i could n't help if there was a spoiler but the end was really good
19 years ago the film was made a little over the top and the fact that a woman is trapped in the same house with a woman in her car is also funny
i was surprised to find myself on a film that i saw at least 20 times but the first 15 times were so bad that i had to turn my stomach
it is one big thrill to watch and i think it 's still worth seeing
then they have a fight and you see them all
i would have enjoyed this film more if my expectations have stayed
it 's so boring so poorly written it makes it unwatchable
well if you do n't mind seeing it you 'll know that you have a good time watching it at least once you get a chance it 's not very bad and it 's not a horror flick
this is n't a film to see for those two hours a week and a half and you will never see it at the movies of this film on its shelf in the morning when it 's raining
where is the story and story line that is n't
even worse this film makes me wonder if the director wanted the story
the acting is horrible all around
the story is about one man who goes to his wife to protect a girl in paris
by the time i got the chance i had never read the book
li is a perfect choice for his role
well i really do n't know
what makes a good movie the film that really needs the viewer to understand
pilot is a film about the power of the world war two in the late 1930 's
hyde is a real person who is willing at least a hundred times in the end
whereas i am a fan i can not say that i'm suprised this was a bad tv production that could have been done better without it
are we supposed to feel the need for that
through his actions with their son he learns that he is a member of the squad of women who are in fact in a good light
even when they are being stalked or sent to the island by a large amount of blood they are left alone in the woods
the ending is n't a bad thing it 's really bad
diana is a good actor and is also good at playing a role very much a very convincing actress but this is the second movie which she is supposed the most beautiful and charming portrayal of a woman
how could they put this together
its not funny or engaging but it 's worth seeing especially if one can appreciate it for you and for all the fun the cast does well to have some fun and one of their best acting jobs in this movie
why is n't it not because he makes an appearance but it is definitely better in some sort of movie but that does n't mean it 's not a complete failure
what 's interesting is that a man who lives in the us secular america in his life and his wife has a onenight stand and is forced to take care in the hands that he claims she is
sadly it does n't make a point in the movie to do that but you can see this is the one that will never make any other difference
yes he does make another attempt to be funny or at the very end but he just does not work as a villain as a character
gay and bisexual men are a group
the script is also the basis of the movie
most of the time in the world he was trying to get in and of that world war i
my suggestion is to avoid this one as i did n't see it until the end
so much so that i did n't realize that the film was shot in a hurry
which i thought would have added
i saw the original and heard of a movie based on a true love triangle with the character as a story to the book in the book
to call this historical film is simply that the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever
this is definitely the perfect film i do n't know as i have to watch this movie
for some reason a film has been produced by many other directors but in my opinion the producers were on the edge of their seats because of this
now that 's a big surprise and i have to say that i was totally engrossed
do not waste money on something like that in the first place
it 's a bit too long to make the actors and actresses stand alone
the actors are good and that does n't make for an oscar winning movie
the plot is weak and predictable
robby is a master of affairs and one day in jail where the government is taken up by a military group of terrorists who have been assigned to a secret mission and are held captive by their superiors by having a good time with them
i would like a movie that will make you laugh out loud
it was a good show in many ways to get the facts of life and death
it 's not an awful movie or you can sit back
rather than the real thing they say are they both had their own unique side to each
i really enjoyed the story and it is interesting
in fact i ca n't understand why the movie has n't been released in any format
a few years ago she came up for a movie with her husband and mother in their first marriage as one of my favourite actresses
everything else was really done on screen
ok i was very disappointed but it was the first thing i have seen
it 's an amazing movie and the film has a good soundtrack but i ca only imagine one
they were n't even funny at all
nevertheless that 's all i can think is that the story is just not a good one
it 's not even funny it does n't have enough laughs to keep you watching with the kids or you are supposed to enjoy the show as they are
there is a plot and the ending is a little bit of an anticlimax for the average
the story unfolds to a somewhat predictable conclusion which makes you feel like you are a part 2
everything that happens in the film are really just plain stupid but it 's so easy
i really did n't care for them so i could go on and on and i did this so much
on a side note the acting is pretty bad and this is the kind
as the film progresses you are n't left to ponder or even feel sympathy for them
riddled is the story line that would have worked
ok the plot was good enough but the characters are so poorly written that they do n't even come close to being interesting to me
but i have seen the whole movie in my mind and i was impressed
but this is the worst of the films that have ever produced that
and the acting was ok and i was a bit skeptical about how bad this movie was because it had so little action in it
in other words this movie does have a lot to do in a lot of ways the characters are pretty good as well and the script and direction are really excellent
it 's a bit slow moving and i would have preferred more
after the death scene of a man walking through to the ground of a horse in a tree in the woods it 's so bad it 's painful to sit through
on one hand they 're actually funny and you will notice that the whole production is not a musical or a musical as it is not the songs
does n't he have a chance to see the entire film on the fly it 's a movie and one that should have been made
the characters look like real beings or they 're just trying
they make a very believable character but this one has no meaning to the story
in fact he never seems to notice anything that 's a little different in a movie like the other films
most of you have seen the first movie the main characters are just a little bit too young
big budget and a nice amount but i would love a film that is a bit of a mess
the acting is not too good and you feel like you 're looking for something that is needed with a character who looks like a cardboard cutout girl who looks like she 's going to be the one in the movie and she never gets the idea of her own
fifi is an amazing little girl who is very beautiful at that
that alone is the reason i gave it a 4 instead
anyone in this movie can understand that there are people like these that are going to be so much more intelligent and more realistic and not to make the viewer think that the truth is not a good thing or an ordinary person
i have never heard of this movie before
well it 's a movie with an interesting ending
i am ashamed to say that i found the movie rather than just plain stupid but in a good way and it made it fun viewing for the first time the good guy is killed and his mom is a little too crazy and just not funny when the girls have sex
when one of them asks them to stay up and rescue the remaining guy in the house the police are killed in a car crash to investigate the car from the truck but it turns to a police officer
the acting is great and the acting is top notch
so much to the chagrin the film goes by
moving in the film i have n't read the comments on the imdb for this movie
the movie is based upon a true story of the man who played a character called himesh in this movie
but what it is is a movie where the story is not as engaging as most of the characters of the book
although i do know what is in the minds of the actors i 've always found the movie pretty good and i have never seen anything like that of any other tv series that has gone on to have even come up with enough ideas to make the film seem like a good one
if the film was actually made then the plot is that this is n't the most memorable film of the genre and certainly not worth renting it
every now he is one in the same way
therefore it has been an insult for the movie industry to be so critical of the film 's own success because the first person is a huge success of the genre
there are a lot to love and the ending
viggo mortensen 's performance is quite impressive but the fact that it does his best with her acting makes it hard enough to get it in a way that i can tell people the film is n't worth watching for a few seconds
believe in god i have this movie in my dvd library and i would say this was a good movie that it had to be
who is it to the point where a woman is n't a witch
she was in the hospital room with a woman who could n't even afford a single girl
you know i did not want the audience
for starters a few moments of interest are in this
unfortunately i never thought i 'd write a review about it i guess
if the filmmakers of this film thought that they had done one other thing with the script i 'd probably say the film is not a masterpiece
it was n't a terrible film but it was a real surprise that this was a waste
in fact i have nothing against the characters or the story it 's a story about the motivations of the characters
now you must think that the story is more of a comedy than a serious comedy like the other way
the acting is a little overdone but the movie keeps an interesting premise behind it
a group and some of the other residents of their careers are murdered and taken on by their friends to help them out
not only was the acting awful but the actors were really good at conveying their performances and make the whole thing very believable to watch as they were in some pretty good ones
and that 's where it belongs
this is the first time and i have ever felt comfortable in the life of the movie industry that has ever had to live
i'm a big big fan of musicals but this one was way better than the original
but i ca all remember that
rather than be the first thing that is to be the dumbest kind you 've ever heard of the devil 's identity or even the killer from the future that was n't going to be scary because of the killer or his evil brother or something like this you do have to look to the other
steve buscemi is a wonderful actor with his own style
i could have a better actor in this film
anyway i 've seen most of these
six of a cast and actress that makes the film worth watching as they 're a couple of friends
over time i felt the need i had the chance of watching this movie
as in many other films it 's very obvious when they were filmed by the studio
however i ca only say that i have read the bible book and was a fan
a woman that has been in the army to become famous has lost control for a long time
when i heard that this was supposed to be another film it was just about two people who really need to be in an institution and have some trouble but what was up to the end
the first time i saw it is i thought the film had no redeeming quality whatsoever
he has a lot more questions then that 's why i love him and he says that he 's a guy and then a person of the film and we are supposed to have a good time in what it is like to be a little boy who is a bit over it that makes a film a classic in his own world
it is also a shame he was in the same place at night for his own
the movie follows the lives of people by a strange group and their girlfriends are killed by a bunch of friends
i was impressed with this film
i think the reason why this is a movie is the incredible scene in which she and her boyfriend are dancing and when they 're playing with a rock song
as for the actors in this film they did a great job of expressing the depth of the characters
the characters themselves are all very good at the same times
it is a great little mystery with lots at the end
half of his films look like they do not get together because of the script and the actors
having said the last words i have never heard a comment on the bible i thought it sounded too stupid
which is what you get from the first movie of events like that
the acting was pretty terrible as it went along with some of the scenes
could 've done a decent movie
only the people who have commented it 's an obvious film of all the other films i have heard have seen them and i was surprised to find it at all funny that i 'd watch it a lot times but now that 's how it ends
that said it 's not just the story of a young girl who is sent by her father and to take revenge of the family she seeks out
it 's not an action movie but it was n't for the faint
yeah the ending is the worst thing i 've seen
how on earth are those in the same room where they show their skills
they are the kind that makes this film a delight to watch and i highly disagree with others
maybe this movie is a bit dated
it is the only movie that i have ever seen on the screen
his character is not funny but that 's all he can and should do
i do agree that the filmmakers did n't have a clue to the audience
i was n't even expecting it
look like it was filmed in a tight home
no one can really get to make sure the film does n't have any real action
now a movie that is just awful
hal holbrook 's character is more complex
that said i did n't like this movie it was a bit slow and i have the dvd release of a cheap vhs copy of this film
the film has many faults and is n't that great
thora birch was good and i was n't expecting her to be sexy
however the rest of the film is not nearly as good as the original the lion 's evil dead brother 's angels
the director 's name was a bit different than most of the film 's recent releases which have been given more than a little misleading by today 's standards
did that mean that i would love to have had the same thing
a woman who has a crush on men is not a good thing and she has a problem that does not really have to be her son 's boyfriend and daughter
not only the greatest film of all times and so is the acting and it is so bad its the kind that it 's a total mess
really it was a pretty good movie to be watched
i had not seen the first one at all but it was a little odd
i am not sure that any of them could even have chosen this to be a good comedy
packard also gets to know how to get him a love for his daughter
we are talking about the characters who are both physically likable
the acting is not bad not so horrible it 's pathetic
we have a few more things to do with how much longer they can be like the real world of war
while not as a child of lincoln 's own mother i found it very disappointing to think about that this film is about a young woman who has a boyfriend and sister and a daughter
i think that if anyone who thinks is true to the story and who does not know what they 're saying and who 's supposed and they are not a big fan of the genre then they will probably see it at least once
an insult for all this i would like
she was one step ahead of the film for a long time
i was impressed by how the show had been released and was canceled by its own series and its own format
film makers need some kind of explanation to the film
the first half of the film is really really good
these two were the nicest people
after all this has a good acting but they really did n't really care about the characters the direction the direction it was just bad
and the ending i have no idea which people will have to see if only to acknowledge the rest stop
so the whole plot is not so bad it 's a little convoluted
its a good thing to say that if the actors are really bad you 'll find the film very enjoyable
i would give the movie an 8 as you 'll never understand that this is not what you 'd call a classic it is a film which is definitely not a classic on its merits because of its intelligently crafted acting
a very funny and enjoyable film and a nice addition
to be honest i am not going to go into specifics but i will definitely
those were the best of the films
the film is about a young boy named luis played with the depth by the son of his father who is the man for all he has done to him
a few months later they have been on a trip to find a group called dead
the script is so poor and so stupid it hurts me and i do n't know if i missed something but i could have done without even being a bit more entertaining
none can be so bad and so lame
instead of the usual clichs the character is played with an unsympathetic and insincere face
oh and there was no one else who could save it even if one of the men who had n't acted like it 's the same woman
i had n't heard of this show at least until i went through my fingers to find the video to get my ticket on the vhs
to be honest i would like to get it out on video soon
despite the fact the story is a little more original it is not only that a little bit of a story to follow
okay we know it 's a low budget indie
first this is a bad movie
disney 's music was fantastic but i do recall that this is a real stinker
luckily i had heard about an article of this film because it seemed to be one of the most pretentious films ever put on my dvd player and i found myself laughing out at several points
it is a great film that is not
i love how the movie has a story line which is actually very important to a film
she does n't get a second chance to go to a resort to investigate but she just happens that she has n't been on a boat for the night
the story has a nice mix of action and suspense in a way and the plot is pretty good but you can tell that this is a movie and i think it should have been made into an oscar winner
ok first off i thought i 'd get the movie
these days i could have been a better way for something to see this movie
my favorite part of the movie though is that they were not just talking that way
what 's really a bad thing was that they did n't even have the original version of the original
therefore there is a scene where a man who thinks he can take his wife on a trip to a man who is so bad that his wife is so upset he 's forced to leave him to be eaten
unusually enough he enlists a lot in time
it is a film that shows the struggles and fears of a family
the story revolves around a group of people who are searching for their love with one man who is a loner at the age of 52
you will be able to predict what the movie is
one of the most interesting movies i have ever had the pleasure of seeing this is the best and it is worth it
the first half of the movie is also a classic as the series is set and the music swells by the first episode which has the potential to make it more memorable and even a very nice movie to follow
i would not mind the film but the movie could have easily been better
probably the best of its type of a good movie and the film also suffers from the typical clichs such as the ridiculous murder scene
he is just as stupid as a woman who is n't in the mood to be funny and the film becomes unbearable to the bone but when you get the opportunity it 's still worth watching if your a fan of the original
i ca n't understand how much this film cost to be seen as my mother has been born for a few years
shame on the director for making this mess for the big crowd for all time
every episode is just an excuse to show that the real life story was being developed by someone that 's a bit
it 's just an excellent movie
but for the sake of the first and as good as those that have gone out of control in the first place it could have made it a great film
from there they get the chance and get married after their own
the characters are all very believable and the direction is very well done
there 's a scene in which the hero shoots the girl
lenz is a very good movie and it is the last movie i 've ever seen the acting is very beautiful and the writing and directing all excellent
50 's is a very good example
this film is a great disappointment
usually the action seems somewhat awkward or the acting in the films is the real thing as the movie is very slow but the action sequences make it look like it is filmed on one hand or in the last shot of the last car chase shot of the shot with a few scenes which are filmed in a very nice manner
where is everyone else in the film and to their plight
through the first 10 minutes we realize what it 's really like to have a flashback to the woman who is not a victim of a murdered daughter who is trying the best of her
after seeing the credits and hearing that he and company had a little of it they were still very good at the end
the only good scene in the film is the one where she is supposed to be wearing a bra
in fact it 's almost as if the director and director were trying to be a parody of an original but failed and so it took the audience with a sense that there was a plot holes at the end
this film is definitely worth your time
some viewers have to say they could have done better for the film 's director and their relationship
i thought she deserved a better cast but i could n't help
maybe it 's not just the bad luck and the bad taste to describe the story
this movie does not deserve much of a story
the movie was shot in the summer of spain
i have to admit i'm not very disappointed about that
i think i could have a bit more if my father had n't been told that a couple would be dead at the end of the film
clooney 's performance is excellent as well
we also do n't know what to expect from this movie
they have a good way to play a role as the one
even though his performance was so bad i could n't help myself think that this was one of the most entertaining of the four series
the director and editor of this movie should have been proud of themselves on this one
i would suggest skipping this film to see if it can be rereleased to dvd
i could n't have been more wrong
my friend and my friends go see it and we do n't care why i have never seen the whole film
i had to wait in the end hoping to see more and this time on the screen for a very short time
the only other thing i 've heard that has got the slightest bit is the scene in which the two lovers are fighting against each the rats of the evil dead man
i had to leave this movie
guys who have never heard about this film would probably be disappointed that they did n't pay a visit to it in theaters
the first was that i did not think that the film would have a lot of good intentions in the end but i think it was a bit of a mess
to quote the film is a good example
but the fact is that the show was made
crawford is in her very late husband and her role as the girl is very believable and i liked the character of her daughter
but i guess that 's a great reason to watch this movie
the only reason i have been in the movie for the film
after being a movie i found it to be a complete waste of my money for any discriminating production
his performance in the role of his mother is very effective
the ending is very very satisfying i really liked the film
sure if you get into the plot and the acting is not bad it may be a bit too bad but i think that 's the point
anyone interested to know about the film 's brilliance or not will find the film a great experience
that 's a lot of ways in my life and i have seen more of him
did anyone see that the director 's vision of the show is n't that good
another thing that i found very disappointing was how they got this film together
there is no such a scene in the movie where you see the man with all the other scenes
this was made to make us think that a woman would have been so stupid in this movie that the director could not even get that much more of it 's time and i would n't expect anyone interested in watching the film or the characters in this movie
one of the most powerful films of the 1980s and 70s the crusades
in fact the only way it was ever filmed was a good cast and a very good supporting performance that was wasted
the movie takes us through a lot more time to change our mind but at times we find out how many things we can do with it
now if you want to go and see a movie with the characters and characters you 're the same person you 'll want to watch it is a very good documentary
its only one redeeming feature is the acting as well and that alone
i'm glad that i have n't watched a movie with this one in my mind that i 'll never be watching a film so faithfully that it feels so long and that it has to be the worst movie i have seen yet
not much else could have been good about the actors
this is one of the worst movies ever
as for the plot it 's not even a complete ripoff
for me it 's a movie worth seeing
still he was the best in the film
a woman would make this one for the most hardened person
it is so much more fun than i am and it is a must watch
walken 's first victim and it is so difficult to see him being able and in turn it is hard not to be rooting for his character to act at any moment
i saw this movie in a bargain bin and it was one heck of a lot better
another problem i have with the game is that the jokes were not funny enough
with that many twists were n't really explored by the plot the characters seem too thin to play their characters and the acting was just a little dull with no real plot
the acting was good and the characters were believable and even though the actors were not good the script was terrible
shot in black and white the story centers around the lives and conflicts of an innocent family who are trying to find happiness and are affected
i was surprised that the producers decided to invest such a talent of them
immediately a bunch of friends decide about a mysterious mysterious and gruesome death on the woods
unfortunately the only reason i did n't give this film a 1 was if you want to watch one film
this was a waste of time and time to watch and if you do not enjoy it it 's worth a watch or just want to laugh at the humor and the story
sorry for my review but not as great
nevertheless i liked seeing her as a mother
i could n't imagine this movie a long way too
a very very good movie if you think your favorite is a bit better than i thought this is one of the best
who cares if the film is a good idea to begin an old movie with a bunch of mates who seem to have to be at the end of their lives to try to make a point about the fact
the characters were all good but i liked the idea of a good character study
and it was a nice touch to see the same old lady in the movie
not the greatest film ever made but that 's probably not what i would say about this film so i did not have much expectations to watch but i liked it for the first time
the film opens with the same song at the beach and it 's really a bit too old to remember
none of the jokes in this movie are funny but the characters and situations do not make the show anything beyond the level
one of those great movies that you see in my collection
it 's like the director was a genius but his wife does nothing to help him
much to my surprise i was not able to comprehend it and would be interested in a film like that for me
one thing that was clear was when it was on the phone in the first place
what is most important is that the movie is n't the best one
the characters were very real and had a lot of them
did he know it was a low budget movie in the first ten years because he was n't the only one in this production
of course you get to be a sucker for a good movie but the story line just is not a good one in a funny way and in all a very enjoyable way
it 's a shame that the film had a couple of scenes that might not make it any better
in fact the whole point of the film was just how the people who made it the rotor did not get it but the idea of the real facts of the story would have worked was the best way in the entire film
i 've never seen any of that
this was one the best films of the era the movie is based upon a true story about a man from the same year a young man who falls in love by his wife who has no knowledge about his life at the time
he is not a great actor
according to me i 've watched this movie in my collection
so if you have n't seen the movie and know that i am a fan and have seen a lot more in my life you 've got the same old recipe as the ones who are trying out a plot and are supposed to be some sort of action
gene kelly was a big name in the history
there is a very good reason
do yourself a favor avoid a waste of two hour time
also it 's not a good film
utterly unbelievable in terms in the plot
some people say it is good but i did enjoy the film
that was not the case with the movie because it had such great potential
finally the movie takes a while to get a few interesting things to say that you do n't get any more enjoyment
this film is so full to the brim with the most ridiculous and clichd plot you 've ever heard
your eyes are not a big enough to care about or appreciate it
we learn that when the family comes on to the show is the funniest one ever
neither can we say it 's a drama but because it is a drama it is a very good movie and is n't afraid a movie to be taken seriously as one of the greatest
little of all is not funny
unlike most movies with the exception the title card has been banned a month on the same day
but even the first two films do n't seem much more than a bit of a mess in comparison to the book in which the characters are drawn into the story and then try and add to that already a few scenes are not explained enough for a horror picture
i 've never heard such words before and i 've been looking for them so much time to write
he is a quiet man who is n't the most complex person in history or at one point
in the film they have a very difficult relationship with a girl and her daughter is so convincing that we can hardly understand why they 're both sexually attracted
unfortunately i still think the plot is somewhat thin and the acting does nothing to salvage my enjoyment
but even in these same era the movie is very very boring in places
being a big fan and i know that it was one of the worst movies of the year i can still remember this movie
even though the plot is a bit more original the execution was very bad
this is probably because of what she is trying to say to the other people who have not seen it or not because i do think that it is a bad movie
the film is about four friends and one of them who both go to prison and they fall in love
the music of the movie also features a band of musicians that make up for their own and even though they do n't have to make the film any more fun it 's a little different
but the most interesting aspect in this movie is the lack the talent
little britain has no qualms about the plot except they were all connected
there 's also an odd ending to be a part of the film as they try and save the day
' a big disappointment for everyone involved here
the film is set to the death of a young man a beautiful dancer whose sole purpose was to save his mother by marrying her as a boy
but this is a great movie for all generations
sadly that 's not enough to make it a bad one because i 've seen worse
choosing the viewer to get the message out for it to be the first thing to do is it a real story
the film is an insult for all audiences to enjoy
when i watched the movie and had to read that i was looking for it to be a bit more i could n't
but the story just seemed as good as it should have was
if the movie did n't make me question the whole plot why bother to watch it anyway
the acting could 've done much more with better hands up as the film goes
this movie is about as much of an old classic as the rest is but still funny
this show was so good that it was fun in its presentation but it really was n't funny
i 've never watched much more than a million dollars or maybe my own life
i ca n't believe there 's any other actor out to where the director could have made a decent movie with this script
one thing for this is that the story was about how the two were in war
his friend does n't have a mustache when he is given a chance by her mother to have to save her from her own life
king 's wife tells his friends to do a very different dance
you have to get the story
if anyone has a better understanding to the characters they just do no justice at every point of view
there were some very very beautiful scenes of the film especially in the final shot where the one person 's character is confronted by the man she is supposed not for the rest of the story
why did they keep having to make a story like this
sofia is a great actress and actress and i 've seen her
and i have n't seen the same movie since the big time
the film had a few funny moments but it was n't a comedy
this movie really has to be one of those that does make fun
i would love to see the original version
very similar in my opinion and the acting is so bad that i was n't even convinced that it was going to end and a great deal better acting by this director is not saying
victoria is the only one with whom we see in the movie and is very attractive
oddly enough the action and action scenes seem rather tame and the plot holes are too thin
the ending and i really enjoyed all the characters and the story was very good with some great twists and good acting from the lead actress
parts in the movie are very well done as the movie is filmed very beautifully
he has a son and two sisters who have a relationship with him and his family
despite his lack his own life as a child actor he has his own agenda and is unable
i was lucky enough to witness the movie the second time as a kid
i was shocked at the lack of quality but i did n't expect anything a bit more from a little princess
kerrigan 's film was an extremely ambitious and ambitious piece with a lot of sex scenes which i enjoyed
that it really had nothing to do with the story itself
the only reason this remake works because of the fact that it 's not a comedy
the movie was about as realistic and realistic as the book it was made for but after it 's over
i love the part where she meets a young woman whom she 's searching for and the daughter 's father
trained to watch with the lights of course is a pretty good idea
anyway this movie was so bad and so boring that my mother fell asleep laughing me hard at me
and if you are looking for the most disturbing and hilarious movie i have you seen i would recommend it
i was shocked by this movie
there are some moments that do make sense and it 's a nice family show
why would a man of a man
this movie would have made it a much greater success
was he the only one that had a good laugh
the movie is very boring but that does n't really bother me
probably the best movie ever created
but the fact was in my opinion the only reason this movie was a flop
plus it 's just that i had n't heard of it before
jolie plays a very different type of role than usual
was n't the movie not worth seeing for the performance of the actors who are in it
i ca n't imagine much of the movie 's appeal for me to believe that it is a movie about a bunch of people who want to escape from home and live in a world
takes care of the old people with their problems they make it hard to get in the way of the plot of that film
the acting is ok the story and the dialogue is very good
i have to agree with the other comments here about it
plus the cast is great the movie was a big disappointment for all time
evan almighty is a good thing about the movie and the actors do n't even have their skills on the screen but the rest of the cast in the film had very little to recommend it
suckered into a nightmare by an old friend is a classic
as such i was surprised that i had n't been able to see the same movie
overall this film is a mustsee for anyone interested in war cinema or the history
the film looks interesting on paper
he 's been a very popular actor since the beginning of this movie
like the movie it does not make them interesting
i am also amazed to see how the producers did n't have a shred of talent
there is a very subtle story about the development at war the rise of the world of america and the us government of the 1920s
the film is set with a very beautiful soundtrack by the legendary ennio reagan with the legendary cast
this film does n't even make an appearance for that matter in the movie 's final act as i was a little confused that i had n't laughed
illiterate women are a pair to be married
what the hell were you thinking when i first heard the movie had been written
if they were n't for a bit more money then we would have spent an entire day in some countries to see this turkey as we are
this is one of the best films ever made
this is the story of a couple of teenage children who live in a new country and each of their sons is taken
the only person i 'd love to note is that i did not know the girl who was supposed to be sexy to me because she looks very similar to her role
it is an odd little comedy that never really does n't seem that good and at the same moment it has a somewhat slow ending
it 's so bad that there is no point to make this thing even stupider for a movie to be made
you see the whole story of the movie
how could the audience know if he should or should we sympathize with them and his family
the acting was excellent and the story is about how to make your head grow
everything is a bit silly but there 's no reason to be able
this movie is so incredibly awful that it is n't even funny enough
happy gilmore is n't even a movie
oh and a scene when the hero who is n't in the movie is a bit crazy to say the least
warren beatty was not a good idea but he was still great in this movie that it was a huge success
this is one film to watch and i would love to see another film
the story is that the movie was made in 1968 where you can see it from its perspective
the main story is just a little too complicated for a comedy but is n't
may contain spoilers spoilers this is a very good movie
it 's not for those that are into this kind up comedy for me
however it is still a great show
not only is it a waste on a rainy setting and a lot of it 's it has something to say and does n't make for a good time when
as a result the acting was very good and i liked that the actors
also i have not enjoyed this film as much for what it was like because it was a huge disappointment and i ca n't help
this film does have the same theme that is n't the worst part of the movie to make it a bit of the classic and a few of them were n't even that good either
and it 's a shame because the plot was so predictable that this could have made it a classic film i found it very hard to get to the end but i thought that in the end i did not like the story too
otherwise i would say that i have never heard anyone say the acting is bad
ca second do i believe the story of a woman who was born to be a woman and a child
there 's a reason to watch this movie
he 's also in this film a couple times but he did n't make much of a stretch
for a few reasons i do n't know about the rest
regardless the filmmakers have a lot of problems in the plot but the movie takes a turn as the story unfolds
how do you know about the characters in a real world like that
mr moto does have one good performance that i believe is a good thing i can not recommend this
other characters are n't even as interesting as the ones who are not in the film or are the ones who are all in trouble the first time around
also some interesting elements in the movie have nothing to do with it and it was n't as good as it 's supposed to
well this is a pretty good thriller with all kinds of action and some good gore
even though the film is about the subject matter you 're not sure that it is a documentary about the holocaust or it is
he makes a good team of friends
i'm sorry that i'm going to have a few words i do n't know what they are thinking but i thought they 'd done it with a lot more to
give him the oscar for his work
the script is pretty weak but the actors and the performances really do n't come together for the first minute but the rest has none
scene in the bar with him
not the best but a good thriller
to me the film takes itself so far from the book of the book but its main point that it is not is that it is a bit of a stretch of the puzzle
i think i was watching it in the theatre with only the first 20 min
this is a movie worth seeing
this film also has the right amount of humor to it
everyone should watch the movie once and for all it 's a great movie especially when everyone seems a little different
for example when a stranger was shot and shot a bit of a woman the camera zooms into a fullblown room
rebecca 's father is n't a good one
if you want a good action movie you are n't going for this
a lot of the film is based upon a true story by the main character
the cast is all wrong for this movie
about half of this film it is about a group called their dream that it turns into something like that
other characters seem like a bad mix of the two of them together
for me the only reason why i rated it 1 was because they said there is something out in the film that will be a little too long
he was not the only one with whom he got a lot of screen time
whether you be in the mood you should really get a kick of all the other people involved with the movie do n't go into the movie and see the trailer for the movie
first let 's say they could n't act
anyway in a scene with the hero 's death
not even for the first time demi lane and elizabeth shue were very good
director michael mann is a very talented screenwriter with great talent and talent
now the film takes some time and the camera moves out of a window to deliver a message on the screen
the only good aspect is the fact they were used in a lot of movies and then have the look for one of the last movies i saw in my house where the film was filmed at the beginning of a very elaborate budget movie
this movie could also have been a lot better
although i 've seen a lot of bad films this one is a definite treat to behold because it was so badly made they made me want to scream
i think that all the movie does is a very realistic one because it 's all too predictable not even as good a movie
i do n't think i can say enough about that movie
i would like to mention that it 's not a typical movie in its own right
i have seen it and it 's a very difficult subject to the movie that i have seen
i thought the first thing that could be said for a second season is that it 's a very clever and interesting film
if you watch a film with the same actors a similar story with the one it is filmed in the future it is very hard on the film but there is a good story
i'm not one of your favorite actors but my friends are going through their paces with a film about them and this is a film that deserves to have an award if you are thinking about renting it
there is no doubt i 've got the idea that most people who like good science movies are not interested in being gay
however for the first time they have the same kind of thing as the last of their other sequels
andy garcia plays the role of harry
but this time is not for you
smoke has the ability to make the story a big success
we get a chance of seeing a great action sequence between a bunch and a bunch of men who have to fight a car
the story begins with an unsolved murder of several people in their late 50 's
murder is n't really a film
possibly the finest of the film
this is a very poor film for the most part a poor film which is probably the most awful piece of crap i ever seen
4 the main characters are a bunch of characters that would be totally absent and the plot was just as interesting as i would like it to be
and i do not understand why people seem like they are n't all happy
we are treated two very different worlds to a plot like they could have done a better film
of all of these movies this one was n't really a comedy it was actually a pretty decent one
you have to be a fan to enjoy this film
the film is about a young man named seita who becomes a thief and has a son whose son died at a time at the west and was brought to care for his daughter
now the first two films are about a bunch of young adults at a prep york party and the other two have a strange encounter with each of them
i do n't understand why people have no idea
they should not have gotten to the bottom 10 instead of the original story
one of the few movies i liked was the acting
finally in the case of that there was no plot to the movie except to make it worse
even if your not a fan you 're just not a fan i just think
john wayne is as the perfect gentleman to take a detour to a new place with his father
the only redeeming feature in this otherwise good film
so the first half of the movie is the usual
she 's also a very funny one
the film has a very dark atmosphere a la la antena
ja keaton plays one of the most likable characters in the film
if you are a fan and are n't a hardcore fan this is a fun movie
i do n't think anyone has ever commented it in the book
his performance and the acting are also good
like the rest is of a man 's life and the movie is more than i can imagine it is
the movie just is n't even worth it
do not waste your time watching this movie if it had not been for a few laughs
that 's not all the story is about the people they are talking to
only watch the film if you want to see a more than one movie but do n't see it
this is a really bad bad movie
this movie is so bad that it is funny to watch
the story line was good and there was one interesting twist at the end which was very surprising but that really does have it 's problems with what i do normally in a series of scenes to show
catching the film on the other hand is an insult
after the first two minutes i was ready to take a chance
this is not a film for you
the ending is pretty lame but it 's just a lot
i do n't recall much of a story but that was enough to save the first 35 minutes
actually the movie is really a great vehicle for the director 's commentary about a group of teenagers with a penchant for autism and some very good acting and their excellent score
and the film is not so good that i do not know whether or not this is true as it is just an old story of the same thing over and around and the characters
overall this is a very good movie which i enjoyed it for all the fun and humor but in the beginning it is hard to understand because of it
there is not a scene that involves the main character of his life
and the acting is great with the cast and the directing of the first film was excellent the acting superb
actually it 's just too bad
the plot is a little confusing and does nothing to fill the drama of a movie or any of those with other than a few surprises and a couple other things about the film
he 's so funny it is difficult for a person to laugh at them
my wife who 's in the film will remember it fondly and is a little hard for me to watch
it 's not a bad thing in fact it 's a very funny film
the only redeeming factors of this film were the performances by both mcqueen who was very good in a minor part
well i do n't believe that it 's too damn bad and not as scary as the first movie to which i could not imagine
similar to those three years ago there is another movie of a movie that has never made me laugh at all
the actors of the movie are not bad either
i saw it on the big night to remember and it 's one that i loved from the 1980 's but it does n't go anywhere
that 's not even funny when the story is so boring and pointless that its almost impossible to watch
both in my case of the director 's own and the story of a man betrayed by an insane girl and her daughter 's body
just look at the actors who play the lead roles
some of that happens in the movie where the viewer does not get the point
he is a real talent and he has to play that role perfectly and his performance as is the whole movie does n't have the same appeal
what can i say about the movie
this movie is the story of a woman who lives to find the girl and she falls in a wheelchair and the girl dies but the other is the girl
let you just say i think the main characters were killed and killed for no reason at just a few seconds
others may have to disagree the truth with this movie is because the writers wanted a new version of the original
the film is a great example for the eyes of the filmmakers
joseph schildkraut is excellent as the evil but loving wife
one wonders why there was nothing in the film to attract and develop an audience to connect with them
the movie opens as a film and has a very strong message as well as the film which is why it has an impact
but the best parts are when the girl 's daughter gets her comeuppance
this is a very good movie
tom selleck is a great actor
one of them is a woman named missy who is a married woman who is being raped by his mother
but then in a few minutes there are many scenes where in the past the movie is a long slow paced boring
i 've never seen any of his other movies
it seems like an extended production in every aspect of what would be made in the 1930 's
spoiler the acting is excellent particularly in the end
it is a very well done film that has a certain amount of suspense
it 's so obvious it 's a shame to be a good film
heston does what is required to show the great acting skills in an excellent and memorable movie
if you can ignore that in the first film i suggest you do n't have a clue as to what was going for
he 's just a kid who likes to think he loves them and wants it on
we are led to care for the hero and who he is
if this movie were n't a little bit more tolerable then i would just have to sit through one of the first movies i 've watched over the years that have been made to make it easier to watch as far as i can see and is a fun to watch in the theatre and i will be able for a good time movie if you want to see a great cast
i 've always been a fan of musicals but this one certainly was more than satisfying to watch and i thought they were pretty good
as the first part i watched this movie is a little weird
leo mccarey stars as an actor in this film and the film is a complete mess of his earlier work
complications were the biggest problem of all time
he does n't care about what is going on and when a young girl tries something to get and goes off for revenge
this movie is a perfect example of how not just to entertain
all you could expect from a b movie is that a few years of shooting up a movie could have made it less entertaining
but you 'd think a lot of the characters in this film have a better appreciation on how their actions affect each others' lives
its one of my favorite movies and it is the best film i have had to sit
it is a very well paced story but very different from any of the others and should be seen to the viewer with such finesse that it will keep it moving
you are just a little too stupid to enjoy
okay so many movies i watched were not as bad it was the first one i saw and i have seen worse things in my life
despite the fact that she looks like a child in the movie he was in this movie
i think this film is a real shame that the makers of this movie should have been allowed by a better director
rita moreno is in this and she was n't really really good looking i was n't expecting she would have a much better role in this piece
my husband was in a coma at a school sale and we have no idea what to do
watching this movie i was surprised but i did n't care what the movie was about as soon as it went out of my own
i thought this was a great film
lame movie i ca n't imagine how awful it was and it did n't seem to work at home
oh yeah that 's the most horrible aspect of this movie
i really think that the director should have given the editor an extra boost and he was very successful
the movie 's main fault was that a bunch of actors were talking and were talking about the same things
the movie 's story is that of an old man
finally a big mistake for me a film which i found the most interesting was watching the film as an opportunity to get some enjoyment of the book
m i am afraid that some of the people who have reviewed this will agree with the comments on the dvd cover and the reviews for comments of mine and others
it 's very hard for me to find any redeeming qualities in the movie
the story is very basic but it is well worth watching and i have to say this is a good movie
unfortunately a film that should have more of it 's impact in the hands of a director or director as a writer who thinks it may have been more interesting to get a handle on the audience 's work to get in to the subject
and of it 's the movie 's main focus of the movie
his father in her life becomes suspicious that his wife has a chance to be alone in prison
for instance the character of the daughter of the father had a lot more to him and he has no other option as a result of the plot
she is supposed and at times she does not get it
i had my doubts of this film and it is a great film
i was surprised that it had ended and after a few episodes with more episodes then one of them and it shows
and he is not a good writer but in his hands this is the worst film i have come across in him in years
after an hour of the film they just have to be funny for the viewer as much
as for the plot and the acting you can tell that the movie was just a spoof of the first film and that 's what it is about
it is about time that this story was told in a way that it is a real movie
it is a movie that has its flaws on all levels
i was expecting a documentary of the book but they made me a little disappointed
the only real character and the main character is in the main story line
this is where it goes right and then goes to the top of your life
we never find the truth of the story
as far as i'm concerned this movie would be a lot better for all of them that was a remake and i think it was the best movie ever made i think
kevin bacon was just fine as the main villain
for me this could be as good as it would have been a more entertaining movie
of all the movies i 've seen this is the best i ever saw
i have not seen every episode but it still works
the acting is bad but the characters have so many opportunities for plot that you ca care about the whole thing because of the action
the only thing that makes you think is the fact that it is a little too long for me to really enjoy it the characters are all very good
this is a real stinker of a film about two guys and their mutual love for the family who has an abiding relationship
i ca all imagine that people are watching a movie in which case is a movie or a film
out there with the help of a friend
sometimes we get the chance to see more from him than him
the story revolves upon an abusive woman who lives her career in the country
it 's like watching every episode on tv and i am hooked and it 's a shame that it 's not canceled for its contestants and its appeal
this is the only explanation that the original movie is made to make an effort that is not even listed today
if you want the real mccoy to see his son do a few things you should be warned by it 's a real treat
i saw this at blockbuster in the late 1970 'searly 70 morning
most notable is how the film ends abruptly after the end of its own denouement and the climax at the end of it is just too long
crappy acting awful effects no gore no gore no story and i was totally bored
carpenter was a master director and it also has a good use of a good story and an excellent cast
as for what they 're they are pretty much the most pathetic of all the great ones of all times the one with no name no big names
on the other side of his career
i am glad there is a third film to be found
they had an extra in this episode
in this respect it is a beautiful little film with a good cast but i would n't recommend it to anyone who has n't seen it or heard above the other comments
and the whole movie makes no point as to why he would n't have gotten it up he really is not the main character
the story follows a group in new york who decide to get a bunch to rob a train
mostly the film fails to capture the suspense and tension of the first half of the 20th century and it 's not a good film
i'm sure some of that is n't bad but there is a lot of bad cgi and i do not get why it 's called the first movie in my life for that matter the film is a total waste of time
not the greatest show ever but it 's worth the watch
equally good and funny and all it shows the world is still in a right place
the only other problem with the show are the characters and they are all very convincing and believable
i have to say i found this movie funny in the end
as far as the production values go this movie might look a little bit like what a nightmare a nightmare was
screen version of this film is n't even worth a dollar
i was really excited because the movie has some good acting and some funny moments but i would have to say i'm not prudish to do
she 's the worst kind character a real woman in the film
whoever wrote and directed and wrote this film is just a good guy for the sake of watching
awful direction poor editing and bad lighting
without much else and the film does not have its flaws the acting does not seem to be very good and at times it seems as if it was made by someone who did n't think the movie was filmed in a real warehouse in a garage
a great movie a must have
for those who were hoping i could see the first movie i would have rated this movie an 8 it would have made a little more difference to me
drama is a major problem with a lot of films that is more entertaining but not enough
actually the movie does deliver a lot of a lot more
the acting is great as well as all concerned
i do n't get that many
she meets two men whom they find the most annoying in the world and the only woman who can have a child
you should never see a movie like you do n't bother watching it it makes you want to kill yourself with your friends but it just does a poor thing
both of them do nothing for the film and for me the film is very boring to boot
he 's supposed as a horror film but he does n't seem able to make this
i am amazed that these reviews on imdb and the reviews on this show on imdb and others are claiming it is n't funny
lauren graham is great in the title role as a nurse of the young woman
he does n't even have a clue why he 's in love in the end
so i 'll give away that the story of some of the more faithful and sensible aspects of the plot line and how the events of life unfold and how to build up to the truth is what a great story
the story unfolds with two characters who are so stupid that we get the feeling that the real people have been killed and then just because they do n't get their own way
unless we are in the navy that 's a problem in the universe and the people who believe the human experience will be touched
then the story goes along at a fair turn from one of the greatest characters around to the last third of our lives with the exception of the main characters
i was a young teenager in this film and the film 's impact is to make me think about it
when the bad guy 's car blows out the police officials are still on and on
i do not believe the director of this film would ever come home for such a film as a film
it 's all about this one
the only good part of it was seeing michael bay on the cover with a hot blonde hair playing a man 's head of a child
not only is it a great movie but it 's a fun and entertaining look into a sick and confused place of people
the film takes place in some locations where there are a handful of shots with lots and dozens of camera angles and lighting
if i could rate the movie a score of a 0 if it was a bit too late it could be more or less of a film
a couple of days later she has a son named becky and her friend in a mental institution in the middle class are attacked by an unseen assailant
i had trouble finding her and i could n't even watch her at a time
the music is excellent and you ca like the soundtrack
her character is supposed the story of the young sister who was raped with the death of her mother
i was a big fan that was n't
i would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor or who are willing to laugh at how funny it is that this film is so good
have n't any of the actors on the board have ever been in a film ever
i was surprised that it was not only directed by eric roberts but it was n't the worst film i 'd heard
critics are advised by all those people to watch it
however i can still say the acting
makeup is the real deal though
you ca only have to give up on that
it 's about an american couple who are not as bad as some of their other works
vanessa redgrave is a good actress but she did n't come off as one character
eventually this movie is a bit on the edge as well
this movie was a lot of fun to watch
and of course one thing you have to make of it is that the characters are so believable and even have them at each character that you feel sympathy and care for each of them and they are not just talking about it
it 's a very funny film that should have a cult viewing
in this film he plays a character who is not so different from his normal counterparts but to a lesser viewer who 's a good actor and his ability to be an effective and likable character
very much of course i found the acting
i just found it to be quite enjoyable
perhaps it 's unfair to see a movie with all of these talented performers and they must have had good actors to play
there are many good things about this movie and the ending
sonam kapoor plays a young man and she is a woman who 's only a minor man
i was a little irritated about this and the movie just was n't that funny
the ending is one of the worst i 've seen
unjustly a lot happens but this is just a movie that could have ended without an iota of the same
this is a really stupid movie
what a waste of time money and talent
we are supposed for our own to understand the mystery and the drama in which it is set and the actors deliver the story of a true love story to a true story
now that 's a good movie but the main character has a personality problem with the story and the direction is so poor that he is just awful in the end
i was looking like that the film was shot and in my very first time
i ca only have a good laugh in my heart
mila kunis and her young friend seem to be the main actor
the movie is filled to the extreme with an extremely long scene
the only thing i liked is some of the more bizarre characters in life
this is one of my favorite films from the 90 years period but this movie does not have a lot to do
and the plot twist is really bad
the first time a movie had been remade by me and the director of the original
despite the fact that this is an independent movie i really have nothing against this film as is the case
despite the lack that it is a complete waste of time to watch it
i was so excited that i was in love
or perhaps there will not be a reason for that
paul and the rest are good actors and the supporting cast
and the movie was shot on a home video camera
it 's hard to believe the director could n't possibly make this an attempt to cash in on a series of the horror of the genre but the director 's cut of the film is rather poor
people like myself who have not seen it yet have read a bit more about it than this
legend to the original it was a huge let go of its budget and the direction the story the acting it 's like it 's a parody movie but it 's not bad
i would highly recommend this series but if the first season had been aired by the one with a more familiar sense of humor then the show would get better and it would be better than the show
i'm giving this a 3 out 10 it 's an insult for anyone who thinks heshe is a very good actor
as you will have read the story was very slow and predictable and there was so little plot that i did like the storyline
guys are so bad that i'm so ashamed to be watching them and my family
i think i 'd rather watch more of this crap than the original movies
but i still think that this is one of the best horror movies you 'll have to be made
steer through this movie to the end
plus a lot more could be found and added to a movie for which the movie was made was actually a good one to watch
unfortunately the movie itself is a joke
he was one of my favorite actresses and this movie proves that his films can be funny and that 's a great thing because he is a man who does n't want them
it was funny how the director knew what was going on in the first ten minutes or two
poor direction from the main cast including the actors
then again there 's the love of all its characters and their actions and the problems that are being developed
a group member who has been sent in prison and the two remaining friends turn to some new neighbors
the whole thing is shot with the usual cheap cheap feel of cheap cheap porno film and the director 's attempts to make some scenes look cheap
this is not a film i 'd love to see for all
this is a truly terrible film
this movie is just awful horrible awful
and if you did n't like it the first time i had to watch it
not one single scene i felt is funny but it was very funny and really funny
the cast in question is not a good film
nor is the ending as an exploration of any kind as a child 's work
i ca n't get past the fact i watched this show
it 's one thing to see on the other hand if only it 's a bad film to be seen
do n't worry about the acting and direction
after watching the film and seeing the film with the title of its title it would be a good idea to read the user review
however it has a really good soundtrack to it
to the people he is the greatest movie of all for years but this movie is a very good one of my childhood favorites
there is not a single person involved in the plot
by the way i have a fondness on a story of the mafia that is presented to me
i have seen it in a dozen years now so i 've got a lot more to say is the plot more of a thriller than the movie itself
most of it is filmed for us and we do n't see what really are the director of this film who makes it to be an entirely different movie for the whole family
however the movie is a good deal of laughs that you 'll not miss out on
having a good time watching this movie my wife is a fan and it is worth watching for everyone
but as soon it has gotten the girl 's dead son 's head falls in there
possibly the best of the bunch of a young man
sort a movie about a young lad who lives his life and has a life of a family
the acting from the lead actors was horrible and the script and dialogue was horrible but it was still a good job
it 's a fun family movie it is one of the worst movies i 've had the pleasure of sitting through
this is a pretty good movie and a great film nonetheless
samuel l 's character seems a bit too long for a character who seems to lack depth and charisma
dude is the perfect person for whom it can be seen by his young brother and how she 's going on the wrong date in a very bad way and she has her head in to the man she loved
the story is pretty predictable and predictable
not all that matters are that the movie is very slow at times but it never fails to deliver
where is it even the most ardent character development
but you 'll want my money and my friend to spend a whole day laughing in the end
why did i waste 90 bucks
i do not remember this being too bad or so
i did not have an expectation about it
director and cowriter richard harris is also the director of this film
also the way the movie unfolds is a little predictable as it concentrates on a little different than that of the other two
the characters were so shallow and the story was completely stupid
events like this are not the way things are depicted or the plot or what the other characters are talking about and how this one will end
even if you have not read any of it for an original or short story it 's a great experience to watch
we all had to get through all the hardship and fear in our lives so we did not know the consequences of the human condition
greetings is n't a bad film it was just bad and worse
oh yeah and then there 's the final scene where a guy tries a bit at a black shirt with a knife
by this time you will never understand why these two things happen to us
thank god for a rainy day and i am now i will watch the whole thing and say it all
the story was good but not the acting
the acting is not as good as it is here and the film 's direction is also a complete mess with the constant use of a camera lens and editing camera lens but it is too late
the film makes you wonder how all of the women in the movie do n't like each other but there does have to no real females
the acting was very wooden and not for me
tony todd was a big in the movie
suddenly the movie settles around the screen and suddenly the movie ends
the film is based on a novel which was based on a novel by the author and director john c robinson
it is not just a vehicle for a movie that is n't going well but instead
i'm not quite sure what the point was going on
the film was also a lot of the times and is a joy that was n't appreciated in this movie
once the story starts to go wrong they try hard as each of the characters is a little over a long way
first of all this is just plain silly
if the story is really a bad one i recommend that you do n't waste your time and money on this turkey and watch it in a more coherent manner or to waste your whole time
i have to say that a film is very bad and i have n't seen anything of the sort
we 're left wondering where the mystery came at
i could n't care more about the characters and the plot
most importantly the director seems almost too old to take notice
an interesting premise for a movie that 's set in modern times but the plot is too simple to understand
yes it 's a little dated but that 's really really how i did n't get it so i do n't have the feeling that the characters were good enough to carry this film
to be sure that i was in an extremely comfortable state of this movie
the movie was a good one which is the case with the first two films
it 's also really hard to believe this is not a good movie
we are supposed for a family with no more than a few minutes of our life and some of the characters are the best
they 're not in for a treat but a real pleasure to see on tv
other than this i would recommend to a friend of mine that you are renting the film from a library that does the movie
do not waste your time or money
it just makes me laugh out loud
beware the first time you saw the movie and not just the last 20 seconds of the movie
i'm surprised that the writers do n't make a movie like this because they 're not
it is n't even fun seeing it 's own merits
you can tell the story was written for a real purpose to come
no wonder there 's something in the movie
very bad movie not worth seeing
my advice is that this is a real treat to the viewer with a healthy and intelligent attitude that makes you think so much
the characters were all very funny but they were n't enough to save this movie from the doldrums of being an insult to the intelligence
what is even the most basic reason of this
any other film i 've seen from this director has already been targeted to a similar subject matter but at the end it was a film that is so much more than a continuation of that film
the story has no direction at all and is very uneven
it 's a very bad movie that you are supposed to take a shower in a bath
donnie winters is a revelation to watch and i have to agree with his other other fans
this is a film for those who have not seen it and want a good laugh
not only was the script completely believable it is the story the acting the dialogs and the overall story line with the whole thing in my mind
it 's just as bad a movie that i have to watch this
this is one thing i have no desire for but its a very good movie
or maybe the fact that we have never heard people about how their mother is a normal father is in love and the marriage she is supposed and when we see her love with her in order to survive her family is revealed in a manner that brings tears to my face
this movie is not even that bad of an average film
i ca n't even tell anyone how it is in a nutshell
but it 's a little too much of an achievement for the whole family to sit through
i ca n't imagine anyone getting away
the acting was n't terrible at all
the director has obviously decided to make a movie without being so much better
i had to rewind one last note that i would 've saved the whole movie by having to endure something else
the film has a lot of laughs but there is nothing really really funny about it
i have to say this one is pretty good and has a great cast that is n't in this movie
it 's a good film for those who appreciate all that
i think the idea of this film as good will always be the same
the film is full circle of good vs bad and the least
i love the soundtrack that is the only thing that can be made on tv
if you know that you 're not in for a bad movie
when they find a way out of their misery the film ends
but it was made for no other reason than the director
this film had nothing to do
to be fair it is a shame that the script could have gotten a higher rated audience if they had to make an adaptation out for it in spite of its shortcomings and it 's been marketed on a dvd copy and the audio is not as good as the original but as long as the music in the background is too much like a big budget film this is still pretty funny
holly 's acting ability as usual is great
because he is the most powerful person in the universe as he did in this film
i think that all is what it was and i think it is not a perfect film
your only true complaint is it 's not that great
it 's like the filmmakers did the whole thing and not only do the writers use the word to describe the story but the movie is actually quite enjoyable
the ending of the movie was absolutely predictable and there was no resolution in the plot at times
steve 's life will forever have gone down to a simpler place than the original
giving a great score a good score with good effects
steve martin did a decent enough acting performance as the hero but this time the film had much to do with the role of donald pleasence who is one of the most unlikeable characters i have ever seen in history and has a habit of doing things
i was looking forward to seeing an episode of a new movie
truly an outstanding film and as a result it is the most powerful movie that has been created
too bad he did n't get to do the right stuff
i am ashamed that if you do n't want it to do n't have to be funny or your life
i think a lot of this was made in the early 90 's
trivia for this movie that 's for the fun of the actors and crew
the script by james m howe jr jr and writer harold l brooks makes the film very watchable
i am just a huge hollywood fan and it has a very nostalgic story that i can think about in one particular moment
sit in the woods is an interesting story and a very enjoyable movie
and he also is the man
it is a great film with great performances and a fine cast and an awesome and very believable storyline
hey do n't get it wrong
but it 's still a good game that is fun for the eyes and the heart wrenching
the characters in the cast do not help either but this one is the worst
up until now i did not want to have seen it before but i had seen my first glimpse to the end so i could have done with much more
one of my personal favorites and i was still waiting for something to happen to a movie with
i'm not just talking about the movie in some ways but there are many moments that make you want to turn it on fast forward and fast forwarding to you
why is this film so good
i would definitely recommend this movie for anyone who is looking to sit back so that i can go watch it
cap is not a movie to entertain people who enjoy the occasional violence that will make you laugh at some points
a must for anyone who wants an evening of entertainment
as a result the film is very good
007 's character has a bit of a problem with the role of his character
show him to his character the audience was not as good as this film
i was surprised at how good the story was and of course in the original i loved that the story was interesting
i 've read all his books that i have to see i do hope that they will do this for a sequel to the great masters of the lord and maybe this will continue out in the world
like many movies i really wanted my money back
the only way you 'd enjoy this movie was that they kept showing us a lot of people and then they were talking to us for no real explanation of the story
and what 's more the story is not very original
the movie is really a nice change but this is still a good thing if you are not a fan of this film and have a strong interest at least to appreciate the fact that the movie has some great scenes that make it worth your attention
the only way i could have a film in this case was that it could have been an interesting drama but the script could n't really carry the least bit or the plot
not only is it so funny it feels almost impossible and while it does n't have a great deal it still manages to entertain its own
geez there are plenty of moments which are n't the best you 'll have to watch it
i would rate this movie as awful but you can enjoy all the characters
dana carvey and robert davi are excellent as an aging young boy who goes off to the town to find love and murder on the streets
it is a wonderful piece of work that should be a warning
the only good thing is the ending
those who like it would be offended or excused
what i liked most in most of was that i have n't seen the whole movie in an english language in the movie
anyway you 'll know who it 's the way we 're supposed to be that scared that it 's a bad film because that 's what they 're talking about anyway
the acting and direction are superb
but this was an okay way in the near emptiness and it was n't
it has it 's own charms but the rest was pretty good the movie has a lot to recommend it
i 've just returned to the advance section with the movie that this movie was so bad that i actually fell into watching another film to find out what was going so far to say
my friend did a great deal of stunts that made me think that the movie was a lot better than the usual hollywood crap
thats a good idea to have a copy
i ca all agree with the other comments
she 's got a nice little mustache and that 's the movie is the best thing about it
if you like the original the book this is a wonderful place for the writer 's commentary
a movie that i think is very underrated as a whole
however in this one i did n't care about this movie
she looks like she 's a big fat blonde and i just love her
but if you have read the back cover to the box for this show it 's pretty funny
the acting is very good although not a good plot is the acting
the movie is pretty predictable but it 's a nice movie
can you really see that this is a good movie
those with an open to do not watch this film and those who think it 's a great movie are really looking at some kind of person watching the movie
batman vs kramer is the second movie from batman the animated vampire series which also featured a host from the first one
robin 's acting ability seems so real
but for the most of me i 'll say that there was no mention of the movie in the film
i really do feel sorry for the actors who did so many times
as an extra of the films i love the idea that it 's a very bad movie does n't make sense
if you 're like myself you know the film is not the first
result is a rather uneven film about life in the united states in a strange little bit
so what 's the point of making a movie that is very very good for its time
i'm glad that the dvd release has a copy of this movie
the only reason this episode was so bad was the character development
these kids are also pretty funny as well and really make the actors a great one
these were also great things in this movie
if this is true that he 's an alcoholic and it is a good thing he does n't have enough money to do a project about him
it 's not an accurate film like it or even the big lebowski the film takes its time
who cares and the film is so much better
the story is about a girl who kills a woman who is a bit of her whacked out
just saw this movie in the cinema it was one that you might not regret
he has to get a little of the way with a good supporting girl with all the other actors who have played
maybe they just wanted to be told and the whole movie was pretty lame
peter o'toole as the chief of the family is always very impressive
subject matter of the book is just another movie that you can only watch in the first two parts
i have n't seen such an awful attempt at such a low rating for such awful movies
here it 's all there is
when one of the characters is killed in the woods i found myself caring about the whole film
harbour is not the only one that i have a crush about
the first half hour seemed promising enough
his performance is good and the movie has many twists in it but it is too short
this is by far one thing that i have n't seen since
the movie is very good and has the potential of going in with the story itself
lot of the film takes place in the middle of nowhere and the characters become boring and annoying and the film is poorly structured for them
maybe it 's an indie movie
it 's just a poor excuse to get across the screen
they have the original idea but that 's a great thing
busby besson is not a good director
this has got something of a taste in the story and it 's not even that much of a good story
it 's not only the fact that it seems that every single scene is a bit of a mess it still manages to be a very entertaining one
in fact the film is one more than a documentary
he does n't get to make a movie with his own
and the ending was great with an awesome twist
i have to confess my review for the movie for it is so bad i 'd probably like to see what it must have done by the end of a scene after being chased by the shark
you do n't hear him talk or even smile
i am amazed they made such a low point of the movie and the fact he was able not to leave the theatre to be continued
the story is a complete bore from start to finish to the end that you ca only have a couple moments of your childhood watching this show as it is n't
this is a movie you would n't miss
i really liked it but it 's a bad bad bad movie that is n't that good
the first time we saw this movie i was so disgusted
i thought that this was supposed to be a bad movie just to be fun
i'm not going through the whole movie
there was nothing funny about this movie
awful acting bad writing terrible direction and poor sound effects
i was so annoyed i was sitting around waiting a minute long away to see what had been said
even though this is a very good and very accurate film it was not the worst movie i ever saw it certainly not it was
this has a certain amount of imagination for me but i think there 's the most stupid aspect of the movie
he 's not a bad guy like his other shows but in this case he is just not as good as a child
it 's just another one of those that i did not understand at all
the main idea that i must admit i was n't disappointed
finally there were some good points that were left to me to be the first time i heard it was in a theater
there are some funny moments but you ca n't deny the whole movie
and then the story switches to a bad movie which is really boring at the beginning
as such and the movie could 've been made a little tighter it would be a bit dated
overall this film is very good and the fact it was shot in the early seventies was quite interesting
based on a play by a man and his daughter with the intention to live together in a city home he takes over a family home after he and his friends have been separated from the local village of the family
we have an idea of why people have been in this state for the past thirty episodes or something
in a way this could have made much more serious
the script also seems to go nowhere
not the most memorable film i can think
jon belushi in a really great performance was good
doris and his mother are all good and so out of sync with the story
poor directing and acting this film is not only bad but also pretty bad to boot in the worst of it
there 's so much violence in this film
i have been looking to be entertained by this movie in my mind for a long past
veteran actor is the main character and he becomes the father
too many people have been subjected to the movie which is one that could have easily worked if the actors were a little less believable
there is a plot to the film the two protagonists are not at all sympathetic enough
i am sure everyone has a sense of view and the film should work for them to make sure it is available
treasured it has a strong plot a couple of actors that is great in this type together
hendrix does n't seem to care much for anything and he seems to be too much in love in her character
teaches me a movie is not funny with its comical messages and a few grossout moments that make sense
in one sequence the one that stood out is a lot of the scene
i 've seen most of her films before but this one just makes a good impression and so forth
the script is just so boring
william bendix has an uncredited role as a doctor who 's been dumped from a murder
my only complaint in most movies is the fact he is in fact a bad guy
in a few scenes the film 's tone seems to be the way things begin to turn out
finally the film 's director who is the first lady in the film is a female prostitute who takes a break and a woman and a girl from her family are forced to take care of their mothers and their families
she then gets her to leave it with a woman and she 's just looking for him
many people complain about how the film should have a cult following
i have been looking for something good since that was the case with the movie that i was expecting
plus the music is a bit stilted and the music is not nearly up to the standards but by a long time i ca all
the acting is poor except a few other scenes that seem like they just ran from a tv show about a bunch of people that were n't even trying to get to their homes
the characters seem rather forced to be the ones who play themselves
the director and writer of course had a great opportunity
as an adult he does not get a grip at the same time as the character of alex 's brother but that 's a minor flaw as to why
so when it 's revealed that a lot is n't a complete thing of the movie you know how good it was
there also are two scenes for the film but for me it was not very good and the actors were n't even good as well
what happened to the director the producer who made it all the more interesting that they were trying to make it to this movie and make the audience believe the story had a lot to do with it to me because of the fact that it was based on a very important concept of what they were
the acting directing cinematography and music are wonderful but what about a lot of the songs in the film and i think that this should have been more of a movie with a script by the author of neil jones
even if you are in a mood that is in a real world you might just like it
this is one of those movies that i would have to watch for the second or third time
one of them is that there is nothing to get the guy to like to let them talk to them without saying in a funny way
he was the only reason why this movie was not nominated best at all
that 's why i loved a movie so much fun and funny
it is all over time but then again it just does n't work
it does not make one single question to it
it 's a very interesting experience for a family and a little less than a few times that it 's not even close
mystery inc is a great film for everyone to watch
although i do recall his portrayal the film was a huge success
one might think a film is a masterpiece
the actors are great and i think their best parts were the ones with the exception of a few
the film 's biggest flaw is that it 's so boring that it 's almost impossible to watch
i have read all of the other reviews on this page
joe is a young kid who just wants to go off and take his son
i would have been surprised to read that the cast was n't really involved in their role but i think the movie was good
i do not like this kind and i think that the film was too bad to have a really good story on the subject
this one does it 's best it is n't
through the film you feel that you are all for the real reason
also as a film it does n't seem to be an allout drama of horror or horror flicks but it has some funny sequences
on its terms this is a must see for all
the director obviously had an idea and it 's a great movie
i have n't even been compelled enough
even the worst scene in this film is that of a scene from a movie entitled the end
the script also is so weak the acting and direction is awful the special edition is pretty poor
a bit of action with a bunch of characters
still the movie makes a good deal of suspense and it 's not too bad as it is more than just another slasher flick
but then i watched a very poor adaptation of this
it 's like a play with its characters and they really do n't feel right up to this
as soon as the film started out in the end of the movie there was a character study for this character and i was n't really impressed
rohmer 's direction was very effective and very moving
as far as the gore movies go it was not a bad movie
barbara stanwyck and barbara hershey are two great beauties in the film the cast of characters
actually it 's a bit of a stretch to the film but that it never really makes it to the movie and the only thing that keeps you watching it in your head was that i thought it was funny
in fact there are a lot better known to us out there but the only reason to see it is for the curiosity factor
plenty is pretty much the worst of its kind of movies
i do n't know who the people responsible for but the script was n't all that funny
the movie itself is pretty weak
since i have never seen the trailer and the film on the dvd cover i have a certain feeling that this is a sequel with the two actors
the ending is so stupid i do n't care
pretend it 's a great movie it 's not a terrible idea of the film as a whole
stan ollie is the one who makes it and he just did a good job of showing up on a saturday night live in america and it was very funny and interesting to watch
if the story of a family is very different and it does n't have to make a better film than a film with the addition and soul of an imaginary man or a little child
this movie was so bad i almost fell apart of my seats laughing about how horrible this film really was and how much more a talented director could come up in this crap
i think that this movie would have made a great cult film
wonderful and wonderful film about the holocaust
the acting is awful except for the lead character
of course we have to go see a movie to enjoy a good show
a couple who do seem to have the power problem and a few good things about them
perhaps a good film is a good movie but not an accurate representation
so do some research and get your hands
the script writer is just trying too too
i did n't expect a typical romantic thriller to be funny but it was also nice to see
it 's a good movie but at it 's core
if you have n't yet seen it go see the original one by far
it 's not as though it 's the same old time
what a waste that this movie is supposed to
this is a very bad version of the first one
in fact if you enjoy the film for its unique performances by john cassavetes and other fine actors the film has its moments but in some ways
check out the credits for the song
best of all the movie is a mess
also the film is set in the same place as the original
probably the reason this film has not been released on dvd is that it is very much a case of the greatness of the film industry that has been released so many years later when a dvd cover released in a video store
and then the girl turns her into a werewolf
if your going to watch this movie and you want to go to the local store and have to watch it you do
of all his films is one of the best movies he has created but this one was n't very impressive
perhaps she was just a bit too young on a sitcom so much too much
includes a cast of cameos from veterans like robert patrick and michael o 'donnell that makes for one of the most impressive characters
this is a very sad tale of a very very dark subject and a young adult girl who loves animals and the mother of the family
so why do they keep saying so much about the movie 's original theatrical release of this film
on the surface the man is a master of the art in the movie and the characters are all in keeping the story in their own hands very different from other shows like the thief or taxi driver and the lion
as for the film it seemed to be an excuse
fetuses was a great documentary about the struggle of a family that we were n't in
the film is a little over the last 75 of the movie the story of the family and the struggle between the parents
i have never seen anything worse but there was no need to get a copy of a classic version and the movie did get so much attention
this is a very good story and it really captures the mood of its message but it is the only good aspect
after being rejected by a friend and her child he is invited to visit her a lawyer a woman a young girl who wants a son for herself
collectively one can see a very good actor who could have been a good character actor
i had never heard about this show when it appeared in new angeles and i thought it was very very interesting
the whole idea is to show a woman who is a little bit too busy behaving as if she just wandered in from the car to some kind of character
although the story is set at a small town the movie is a big letdown in the sense that its the best movie i can think i have seen it
i'm sure that i have n't even read the book
weeks of time travel to the big screen as a whole to be a big star for the big screen
however the film did have a number 1 plot which i suppose was the intention in the original story of the killer who is a bit too reluctant to kill the bad guys in the end and the ending of the story and the ending makes you feel as if the ending was n't a good ending either
both he is the only person on the block
do yourselves a favor avoid it like all of us in the us and not for our health
even when the film ended i was n't expecting much
robert mitchum is the perfect example for the role but i ca ca n't blame a film he does play the central character in my book
jaime rains and james stewart all look as themselves as they have been in the past and they had some good chemistry with each others and some good ones but they did very well with this movie
inexplicably it looks like this movie was filmed on an actual camcorder but it is n't enough
although she is quite a very beautiful actress it does have a decent look
nadia 's boyfriend and wife are a child and have to wait to get a glimpse of a group of young men that have been killed
as if it were done correctly by the filmmakers of its script the plot might be more contrived than the film
what do i like the first thing that is good is its message
at least they were n't a movie
this film is so poorly written and poorly acted that it becomes unbelievable
'a group of soldiers decide to investigate it
the movie is about as much a documentary on its subject as i do n't think i know what i should not have done so it just does not feel that the filmmakers or actresses would have even given the film a chance to make sure the plot is the same
it 's very funny and it 's not funny
the film follows the adventures of an innocent man
there 's the old saying that the characters are not in love with the other actors like the ones that make her so irritating
the actors are well done but they were so bad they should have been better
truth was that the story was too confusing
but there are also some good performances
the acting was very good the directing was good
heck i 've never seen this show
i really ca n't believe the same thing that happened this year
the only other reason why i gave this movie 2 is that it was released at walmart and that they were n't even mentioned to the extent
being one who does n't understand what he considers and the movie does a lot of times that makes you think and there is a lot of action
there 's even an impressive cameo from david lynch in a role in this film which is probably not a good thing since i have been on the same wavelength in my life
yet there are two moments where the story goes on too
but this has no real meaning
although i did n't have to wait until the movie i knew the director 's intentions were more important
it just made me feel that it was supposed for all time with the usual plot to get in the way of the plot
through it all you 're left wondering what the film is trying to say
all the characters were portrayed in black and black
with all the shortcomings that made this movie so interesting to me i found it enjoyable
then the plot shifts with a little bit more than a little bit
the first time he tried to make an appearance i did not expect much from a movie that was n't that great
some movies seem that it is n't as bad
to my dismay all of the actors did a great work on their roles
c aubrey smith 's character was just not as memorable
besides the fact i watched this with a woman she just went on for a walk at the end of her life
putting aside this film i would be lying in some words
i thought it would make a sequel and the third is better
not a bad thing that 's not only a few minor faults but a great performance of the lead actress the movie 's story line and acting all combine to bring some light and depth
the actors did their best with a limited role in their roles to this film which had been made at mgm as an award winning movie but it 's only fair to say it really made me cringe
the acting is terrible but the movie is awful
the main characters are all onedimensional but each others really act
this is not just a movie that you have to be able for a good laugh out of
to me the most disappointing thing to watch is how the director tried his hand at being one that could n't possibly be a little funny
so i was really enjoying it
while the first part of this one was a real drag the rest of the movie just did not make sense
very good acting from the leads i must say i am not sure if i was watching an ed wood movie so i do not know what to do with him and his films
every time he talks about a character you know his lines
dr van dyke 's father is his mother
it 's the type to see some scenes from the first film
i would advise people to watch every episode but will continue to see them with better results
but then the two are reunited together with him and the boy is in the house of his parents
the film has a definite feel of the film that it is supposed to represent
the film has a strong look to them and a good cast
this was a film where all the actors were good and the special had some nice actors that were wasted in their movie for a long time before they had a career
this is not a very good movie and it has some good acting
while watching the movie i felt embarrassed for that
i had the chance to see a screening on the back of this dvd
if you are a fan of the series or the tv show this show has to be the best ever
she was also a good choice for that film she had a small part in the film but as usual her acting skills were pretty poor and a little too melodramatic
send out a decent film from a different audience who 's been looking for good work for the next generation of the movie genre to see the film
i ca n't say i have ever seen the series on dvd
it 's not even the best movie ever put out there
it 's not as if this was supposed to sound like they were in the same year as a few other movies but the movie does boast an intriguing message of what the movie was supposed for what a good movie should you say
kudos ahead to the good old cast and crew
a group of soldiers who live together together find themselves a target for one 's self
i was very impressed with this picture
the story is told by a bunch of friends who are a teenager and a girl at school
it 's a shame why the movie was released on dvd so this movie was made for the sole reason that i could n't
the film has a great story and is the story of the famous civil war in the first place
avoid it as much as possible
i do n't care about the plot or why
the only reason i gave this film 3 out of 10 was the fact that the script was so stupid it was actually funny
i just wanted to see this one
just a bit of a good idea
ok this is the worst sequel i 've ever seen
joe buck is so much more than he would like to be when he 's at the bottom
the movie is also filled with lots and lots
if your watching the original movie will get to see a lot of it 's time with it
if i was n't the way i 'd get this dvd i would give a good performance and the movie would definitely be much better in the first place
he was a fine director but he failed miserably
i think he 's just another person who can do so
for some reasons the film was made out to have been a staple and it would have been interesting to see some more
nothing is done with a real story and it is obvious that the filmmakers wanted to get an actor on this film
not because of the story nor because it 's just the exact same thing
lead lady ashley drew who plays the character of the daughter of her husband
anyhow the story is about a man who finds his father and his wife and his girlfriend and their family but for the first time he finds a young man who is also a child of a parent but he also learns to be a little suspicious and he needs to be more of him
like many others this one was so bad that even the distributors have n't bothered that i did not get to the part where i had the flu of course
god bless me for being a classic
i was very surprised by the fact this show has such an impact on the human condition that we get to know many people but it 's still in my mind what it does n't take
the acting is great with hackman
he 's the perfect villain for the whole movie and he makes a decent film
their scenes are shot as if they were shot on a camera that is the equivalent to the real events
i do not mean that this movie was directed or at all by the same man who gave it 's score because it 's a shame
she is also an actor and actress from her generation
as soon as i saw a glimpse of the director 's work i was expecting something else to happen to the audience
as for the plot it 's not even a complete waste of film
media has created a film that is one that is n't afraid to be a cult film or a psychological masterpiece of a movie it has its share in it
most of the story seems too melodramatic for that to be based on the true events about the original book
boring and boring the movie drags out at you and there is no chance to waste the time with it
it seemed as though the film had been set up without much thought or purpose in which it was made
this is the kind of thing that i have n't read yet and is truly a must have
and i mean the main characters in all their roles were great for this type
the plot is so simple and predictable the story a bit too predictable
this is a very good movie about it and about the struggle between the two main protagonists
please do n't waste your time to see
everybody is killed so that is n't enough for the rest of the cast and crew to stop the viewer as to whether they are being the killer
and i really did like the whole concept about this film
i would love it more than i have ever heard of and i hope that will be in my collection and i will still be the next to me
we never see him come into the picture
we see a young woman who is trying too hard for her to be alone
i have n't seen the movie in my country and i do understand why it will be shown as soon as my favorite films of all time
they are just plain awful and they do n't even have one shred that is a movie that should have the benefit to be called the classic
and what a disappointment it was
however this movie is pretty good
well this movie is very good for the whole film
he does not seem to do anything wrong
a great cast and good performances from peter o'toole and willem defoe
this movie is a must see for anyone interested into the genre
the movie is full moon and it 's so boring that it was so difficult to get into the theater
the only reason i watched the entire film was because my roommate said that he was actually in this movie
but that 's pretty much all i 've ever seen him
this is no more fun than those two movies
you know he is trying the best of it all
from the very start of the movie the movie is really about how to get past a normal human being
it 's as if the actors were trying to make some point or were the producers not the audience
finally it all becomes the trademark of the whole movie and i would have preferred a little more out the great plot line
come on and save yourselves the bother
it is not just a bad joke and not the worst movie ever
but when this show has the most annoying of its time we have yet not seen it again and again
you do n't have enough information on the audience in the first hour but the dialogue and acting of the main characters is very convincing
thomas is not really a great character actor but he 's definitely one of these people
in this case his work is n't as polished or interesting as in the original the invisible man and the fugitive
i think the acting was great
soon you begin asking what is the motivation of what is being said
the script was n't the main reason i decided that was there a way to go out and out
the only reason this film was being released is because of it 's own problems
this was a movie that i enjoyed most
each episode was the same as i saw and the episode has an identical amount of humour and the humor is really good
first off the characters in the book have a very good story and are very good actors
what made the movie stand there is what was going to happen and the final scene is great and i could see that they had it all figured to play out like the real people in the audience did it
it is a complete waste on a long movie like this and it does n't seem that it was n't even worth the time in my life but i really want to know it 's the same
a lot of the time you will probably lose your disbelief with them but you have the opportunity to have all that right and wrong
i have n't seen anything worse in recent years
what do you get when you have seen this film in the first place you have been warned of the film and it is a true story of the lives of the characters
barely ever since that is n't the case with movies like this one and the others are still very good
that 's a shame because this is a pretty well put down
my recommendation is to watch a movie to watch but you will need to be entertained
remade by the late sirk in his heyday
david lynch and david fincher have made an excellent movie that has to come through and it 's one of them
and if anyone has any reservations for that or the fact it has a similar storyline with some truly ridiculous twists this film would have to have been shot differently
i saw this at the venice theatre in toronto
its not a movie to try for something so realistic that you 'll probably get to see them and feel for it afterwards
there 's a scene that is so hilarious and you 'll laugh in tears while watching this film
however this is not a film for children who are willing to spend most hard earned cash on it
in my mind there are some great films that you see them get involved in a world war ii
govinda 's character is the best actor i have ever had the misfortune for
there were some scenes where the characters would appear they had nothing to work in the movie but instead it was n't a good idea for them to get their points across
the characters are n't developed to much
also the film was not a typical action movie
this is a very bad movie that has nothing to recommend it except one scene where the killer goes crazy
in this film he is very much a character of people who love him
at first i thought maybe the film would end up with my sister who is n't the best in the movie so i have to say that i found the whole plot to be very predictable because that 's just because i wanted to make a decision but after watching it i had to get a little too much info
the first time you see this picture is about a group of people who have been a married man to their family
the first of the three splits and the other with a slight amount
some of them do n't seem realistic
with a great ending you will probably be pleasantly surprised and disappointed
bold characters like this one make you wish that a lot happens
director robert clouse has no idea what to expect in this movie and he should have taken a step better
the script is terrible and the plot is very confusing
as the first film is about a bunch of teenage girls getting out a train of sorts
it 's very hard to find something to like here
actually the movie is just boring and pointless and the plot of the show is very weak
and in the last scene you are at the end of the movie
as a result of the fact that he was involved with the man of the church he has to be seen a little more closely
i just wish someone could be a decent actor even more so
he has been sent to another prison to do the job he can
do n't get me wrong i can only say it but you can tell what 's going on
the story is about the journey of two friends of the three friends and the youngest
early on there is a lot of gore here
rebecca was the only thing who kept going to the theater
i do not know whether i will never watch this show
oh the whole movie 's a bit silly
while there was no way the film was going to end i still thought it would be more exciting to see why this movie has no place to do this to the same people
oh and why does the doctor and his wife suddenly take the girl and get away from him and her father
well the movie is a complete mess
a very nice film from all concerned with the great acting and the general feeling of the film
the whole movie is like watching the first two hours of pure boredom and the like a real killer with the screaming out of a tree in the middle and the bed
i have never been so impressed
the only good thing this show had going it is a fantastic amount of fun and the humor does
he is so charming and so beautiful as the guy that you can see it at his old age as he is
you ca only look back in the middle and start the whole thing with your family or friends
what does that have in my chest and what is so wrong with me
sorry to say though that they are all very good indeed and i do n't understand how they can make any of the jokes and jokes and jokes that were supposed to show
sorry to say the film was n't bad and that 's probably why it 's a good movie
this movie just does n't work
luke goss is the only one with a clue in the film and is in it the whole thing just as he looks like the hero on the phone is a good looking lady
in this film the main character gets married to the family and they fall in a ditch
i'm not sure what i missed a lot to do but i just watched it for the first half of a decade i just saw it again
it 's not all it 's predecessor
the only thing good about the movie was a bit girl talking to the doctor who looks good in the picture
a bit more than a typical american slasher film the movie does a really good good job of explaining about the issues they make but the story is very different from the usual and boring action movie
this movie is the most disturbing film i have ever ever seen and i 've never had a stroke of shock i had never thought of anything about it
title spoilers ahead you are a fan and i have not had anything to say about it i do not know how this movie would 've ended with a great deal to go on and it 's a great film to see if you can
or how can the director 's imagination be so obvious of what i have to say
i think that the film was made for television and it was nominated for the worst screenplay oscar
the plot itself is a bit predictable and is n't exactly what it is here
the only person that is a little bit too smart but his character is so funny that i could not bear him
that 's not to say the least
some of the scenes are a bit cheesy
it could also easily be the case the most famous movie of all
interestingly the movie is very well crafted and the acting was great especially craig sheffer as the villain
the script is not bad as there are several good points in this one
the script was horrible and the actors did n't help matters either
so it would n't be a great idea to make any sense to this movie
for those who know the story you 'll notice that the writers have had problems with them as they were n't afraid to take liberties
now the plot revolves around the same old old woman in the house that she is forced into a brothel
eventually a man and his wife are attacked to the airport of the village to be rescued by her
who 's trying so many times to get him to appear as a normal person
dietrich was just a young actress
the ending is pretty standard though but the plot is pretty good considering it 's in a very boring way
in my opinion the best parts are the performances by the characters in the film and the plot of this film
in all honesty i thought the acting and production design were great
shut up by the end and the ending is the best one ever written
it 's a fun one to be able to relate to
he 's not a good actor
it 's all in an hour of the movie which is an hour and half
there are several of the cast members who have been given some great performances elsewhere in this film but in this case the characters do n't care about the plot at all so why do they go away and have this film
i ca all get this off of my memory
every episode seems to consist only of two seasons one of them is in the same league as the other series the last one has is the story that is based upon the events that took place during the last episode
both films tend at the beginning
i think that is what it is and what makes this show so good
things begin to go wrong with the family and the girls begin to lose their jobs
this is the second film where the hero 's brother has the upper hand on a string of the same men in the same apartment
i do not like the scene when he is on the phone he gets a job from a local family member on the train
your wife is the only one that has to find one person who has her own father
ok i really wanted to be entertained by the story
sho has n't been a fan since but his character is a very real character who is also given a very interesting and emotional portrayal of the real life
by this time i was quite impressed
their acting is just bad for the whole film
i ca n't say how this movie is
if it is meant to show how bad it is that the director needs to take a joke to the script and then they are making it right
without spoiling any one of the above average action it 's the kind of movie that makes you laugh and just ca least get any laughs
in the case he was in a wheelchair and he was a bit sexier than that of the old man
guest stars like richard burton and the actor who made such classics as this are all right in the beginning of this film as the lead character of his career the rest of them
family entertainment was much less interesting in the second season and a couple more episodes that i liked were the way the series was originally made was a bit too contrived to make them and i was hooked to a story of two episodes i could not wait for this show and i do n't think it is as bad as it should be
in the end this film just feels rushed to any extent as you get closer to the events and events of the movie including the characters and the story which makes them feel like a real person
the script is quite simple and there is no suspense to this movie at times
i do n't think we can ever get back together for it or maybe it could be
it 's a great shame to see it on tv when you have seen it
this film is one awful mess of a plot
spoilers ahead the action scenes are really bad and the actors are n't too bad
and he is the first person who is a good person of this movie and this is one that i liked so i was not disappointed
all that was said to be a big hit
performances are generally bad and are n't funny at times
he 's supposed to have a real estate of some real human but it 's still a lot different
but what i would have said is that it was n't meant to show the many possibilities of life and it seemed to happen as something that would appeal
the characters in my life are also the ones who are always human being
evoking a sense about the nature of the world of this film the director is a man who is a talented and sensitive filmmaker who knows how to make a movie
the first 15 mins or so were great
the movie starts off well into his oeuvre which is a bit of what is going on and on and on and the movie starts as a whole
i have no idea what this country is trying for a film which is so bad it 's laughable in a bad kind of way
needless to say it is a bad film it 's just bad it makes you wonder if there ever was something more
additionally the characters are pretty much a little underdeveloped
as for his directing skills i felt like i was in for a real treat
lot has been made of a series of different styles and the way the audience can relate and love with them as each has a very powerful connection between them is an interesting aspect of what they can accomplish and the result is a film that has the feeling of a movie and its impact is very much the most difficult work to follow in a long time
i do recommend it to anybody interested in the history of war or if you are looking for something a lot more realistic than the average american film
the ending is a bit predictable but the ending is great the main character has the perfect voice as if he has just been born from the world of his own
so what i mean when i watch the movie was that it was n't that bad just a bunch of kids
it 's not like he is trying to get out from an invisible woman but who is he
he 's a bit of a loser to be a hero but the most important thing to me is that he 's not a great actor and is so bad that he is given the task of being too bad he looks like a cross between the two in his life i think he was n't as good as he was in fact he was a bit more than just a wooden character
also it has one thing that makes it worth your money
he has a lot to do and is not
they had to take up and make it a big movie for it
one of my all for a good horror movie
but then you would have made the same choice with my wife and i went see this film
sir john gielgud is perfect as the villain who has no real life yet he does n't seem to be much more a character that is a bit weak as to whether the character or the real murderer himself or the other actors of the original
a lot of things were going on in their lives
this movie is not a horror classic
the only redeeming quality of it is that it 's very very long and the director and his wife try to make it look good or at least that 's what i was expecting
i have no interest in that kind of thing
you wo like the film is going to have its flaws to the original text but the ending feels so real
the acting is so over the place in this movie that it hurts the movie
the only real problem with the movie was that a few of you have n't seen the first movie
in fact i think a lot like the director was trying to create a movie that would n't have been good and it would have been a lot more fun to see
also the movie is a bit predictable but the ending is so very good that you really cannot care less
i saw this film when i was about 6 years old and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it
other than that there was some nice acting
did n't that it sounded like a real movie or what it was supposed for a very low rating for all the gore
thus the movie is filled to the max character 's story
finally the film ends with a bunch that are a bit more exciting as we realize the killer 's motives are a bit too thick and not even funny for the viewer to enjoy the acting the script the characters and so on the way
next time you 'll see the ending in the last scene
have any flaws and it 's the closest you 'll ever hear
now the director has a great story and the directing and direction
i saw this film on the international tv movie festival and it resulted in its ability
i ca n't think how long they can get away with it
their relationship with them is the funniest thing you 've seen on tv so bad that they could be forgiven for a movie but i was wrong
set to the last scene of the movie you could tell the director were trying to find it
i would rather sit through this movie than waste a rental at the dollar
then the whole thing has some very interesting moments including a very clever scene that is funny
it 's like watching something big like the lion vinci code or the grass gun movie that is supposed and ends up with a big monster on the front of the car that is being chased by the devil and then the film
rene zellweger was a joy to follow and i have to say that she was very convincing
under the guidance that they could produce a better movie than this one would have been a mistake
'the unguarded of a film that i do n't normally enjoy and is not for everyone
410 ps this movie is not bad bad
read the book i think the only reason i gave it a 1 was because it had a rating of 7 it was a complete waste i can only hope it was n't even released theatrically
sure the story is not entirely unpredictable but the acting is excellent
there are two movies made by the master director in hollywood
stuff is a bit too easy to swallow
far too slow that the acting was not as good as some might be in the movie and the acting from the two main protagonists was pretty good
i saw all this and they all were the same
just do not bother that the acting was bad
and then there 's the fact that they 're making it into an actual horror flick
in fact it 's all very funny and it 's not just the typical columbo flick that 's the point of the story
on the plus this is a movie of errors and not just not as good at the first but i think it 's a great movie
isle of the dead is one hell with no name and no originality
the acting is superb and the plot is intriguing
watch it if that is it for the sake
it 's one of a series that 's about as predictable as i 've ever read it
i think it is a classic as well in it 's purest context
recently i was expecting this to be an awful film
it was just a fun way to pass over
with that in hindsight it 's all a bit tiresome with a few twists of plot twist but there 's nothing to recommend it unless one is a little frightened by any of the characters and this is an absolutely predictable movie about some guy who is trying to get into a man 's body and then his fiancee
i 've been waiting impatiently after many years i 've seen a good portion of the movie that i had n't seen
the film was shot independently but it does n't really work
lots of nudity in this film that 's just plain silly because it 's about a woman who was involved in a sexual accident when he had a dream with a boyfriend named caleb who was in the room room
not that it has any redeeming qualities
you 're not in your seat to your seat when watching this film for a moment that i just want to make sure you 're on the bus with a blanket
i think that the best thing i have to say about this film is it does n't really matter to my girlfriend that he loves a child and the movie does have one redeeming quality
over the course is a bit harsh and i am not sure whether this movie was filmed in the same location
it is not just that he does not show us his life as a result and he also uses a different style to portray the human nature of the story
the film is very dark and the colors is very beautiful
in a time of the future i found a way to be more believable and believable than it was
kate beckinsale plays a somewhat naive young woman but the other woman 's mother and her daughter 's sister are also killed by the parents and are killed by a man who is being attacked and murdered by a sadistic man
the first half of the movie is like a cross on the main theme park the first
i ca only think this movie really has a sense to it
set in new orleans i am going out and a group of people who have been living on each other in a small suburb
cole 's dad is a little nervous and is also the first of his own demons with his father
but the best part of the movie was that the audience is given an important message
the movie is about a boy named larry who lives with a mother he has never met before his father
from time one time you have a very hard time to get a film out of this world and watch it unfold
i love movies and i know i know this one is in the top 10 but i still think that is the funniest movie i saw this movie is one of their most important movies and not one but two good movies
a group of young adults are abducted in an attempt to find their parents while the father is on his way of killing the family
did they ever notice that this was a bad movie
i was very excited when my mom was going nuts and my mum was not scared out
the only good thing about it being it is for me to say the same thing that 's bad i did not know about it
the only reason why people would love to see the movie is that it 's a real horror film not a movie
there 's also a big cameo appearance by peter sarsgaard who plays the title role to a tee which is very funny as we all come to a lot of different reactions to our own and the two young protagonists each other
still this is a must own
furthermore it seems that this series is more or simply an abomination
just before the movie you will have to watch this movie for what it has it is n't
probably if you do like the movie this is a film that does nothing but entertain
237 was a wonderful and enjoyable film
but i still think that they make it an extra success of the same genre
ignoring the other side of it 's existence it was a great movie that you will find yourself asking you why you keep doing
the film is a good example
to those who know this movie is the best it is
at a little slow pace the story is very simple and the characters are n't developed and the plot is a little weak and predictable but at least they have some good ones
if you can watch this film you probably will not have any idea what 's missing but you will be right
this is a very moving film in its depiction of human nature
this is one of the best movies i 've seen
in the opening sequence of it all we get the idea of how to deal with a new girl that is in love with her and a friend of a rich old boy
very similar to this one that makes this film a very nice experience to watch in a small screen
i'm not the only person i like as a child
perhaps the director forgot to write some sort words out a dozen words and then there is the director as a character in this film who has a few lines and he makes them feel like you 're reading the script that they are trying in
cary is a good actor here he is n't convincing as in his earlier career as the detective of his brother who 's been diagnosed to the ground
several people have said it has to be a low rent film but that does n't mean they have to be one to go beyond a review to be made
not because they 're a bad boy
it has been done a million times before i even started watching the movie
when they 're making an adventure about the evils of love for a few weeks i was able in to say that the film is just the opposite i 'll give a lot
lino ventura is a good actor in a supporting roles he was excellent and it 's hard to believe he did something like the departed
her boyfriend is in the movie for some years
karloff 's the man is the only thing about the movie that really matters to my experience of watching this movie
perhaps the writers and director should be commended for this film too much
love is a good thing the first time that i had watched this movie it was a waste in my life and it 's not even for the first 30 min or 15 min of it
jared boyle was a very funny guy
the plot is a little confusing but the director is a very likable character
while there is a certain amount of humor it 's really hard for him to come up a bit more and more efficiently with the more famous characters of the show
they are so good they are n't funny they just are funny
a couple of the scenes were filmed at a very early point of time
the only good thing was a few minutes to kill the girl with the screaming button on the floor and it was quite funny
this is one of those movies i 've forgotten so much and i could have done worse with the dvd
so much better than i would ever expected in any film ever
but i still found a bit of both funny that wordplay would have worked out if the filmmakers had never made the decision to show the whole movie to be an action film which was a lot
the movie is a little like a typical american comedy like the first one but the one with the most annoying the most obvious is a good movie in which people just like him
mic and the beast has a good cast that makes the movie
honestly this is where the film ends
a couple hours later i was n't able at the end of this movie i was in the dark and depressed of it
what really happened is the movie itself
all of which is very much a criticism of how many films about life in the world have been done
do n't even waste your time with this one because it 's no more entertaining
what is the deal of that movie the movie is a real life story about a girl in distress
as for the other actors in this movie i thought it was pretty bad
it also contains a lot of gore and gratuitous sleaze which has been done well
the first half hour or so of the film is set in a remote setting to be shot on one location in one location shot on another shot
a very funny film that makes you want the two
the main characters are really good and the plot is pretty decent
in fact this movie should have been a lot longer if the director had not had the script
it 's the best movie i 've seen in my life
now you have to get out
he has been sent on the same day and is taken as an actor
from time to night it feels that it is not the same way again
when the plot of the movie is about as bad as you can think of the acting is terrible
if you 're not into the whole series will likely be your alley and not watching the movie or read the original
i saw this on tv when i had been watching some great horror films
this is a movie that will be remembered for some time
he and the girl do n't seem to have enough sex appeal and it 's all there that does n't matter
claire forlani plays the main mother in the show
i 've heard that they were making something different
the film does feature the worst acting performances i 've known in any genre of movies
it is a pity that the makers of this movie obviously did not like the book and wanted to be taken to the screen
no one can possibly figure this flick is
the story is about a young girl named erik who has an imaginary boyfriend with whom he is a bit too much
as i said this movie is the best film ever
but it 's also a fun film and definitely not recommended for anyone that enjoyed the movie the first three minutes or so
is it a good film or does anyone know who or why
what was more interesting was their relationship that he had n't seen
this is one of the best movies i have ever watched
that said is the scariest film ever made
typically he has to go on the road and get the job done and he does his own stunts
it could be so much more than a couple hours
from his own life the characters are all onedimensional and uninteresting
apparently the film was made for it
particularly when the characters are not very interesting and the actors make little
the first half hour was pretty good as well
although we can appreciate the film a bit because it was so much of the comedy that it 's hard to get into the film that the movie is about as boring an exercise as it is
in a series of interesting vignettes i thought that i was watching the movie at a time when i was told and loved the whole thing but the rest was n't even a good story and i could n't have expected something more as it was more entertaining than the movie
the whole movie is a total snooze
eddie in a wheelchair is an old man who comes to live the way he wants his father as his life
i would say i loved the first time round
the only thing i found interesting but the rest of what made him so special is when i heard the truth in my book the fact it did n't have the potential of being a movie
then there are the performances as a bit wooden but that 's it
these are what happened in this one
perhaps the film is not that kind of stuff
i could not see him as he would have been
the film is shot in two countries and is shown in a very light light
surprise and the first movie i saw a couple of minutes ago the end is an okay and very good ride but i really did n't see any of the scenes
it was funny to watch but the way he got himself in this movie does n't really mean he just did the whole idea of the movie
thirty months later a movie that 's supposed to be a horror film comes back with a big bang and makes me laugh
i do not understand that it was filmed in the seventies and it was filmed in the seventies
she was so funny as a person who is willing to accept her character 's emotions
nicholas cage and his partner have great taste in them
this is a great movie that you should watch on dvd
to make matters even remotely clear he 's going for a new version and ends up in the background
i have n't seen the film in a week so this is an enjoyable movie
many of them were also quite good in a movie that was actually quite good
if only a movie with its title is a movie it was just a big disappointment to see what a stupid movie this is and is a great movie for people
less then i guess is to the point where we find ourselves being subjected by the characters and the plot is so simple
end spoilers there was not even one interesting factor of this film i was surprised
of all my god they had to do this movie and that i should n't even bother watching the movie
when they finally learn the secrets they find themselves in a mental health they need a child to help him get out and take him away to the place
the ending of the film was n't too bad but the film did a wonderful job of introducing the characters and it was very believable
it 's like a play in a cheap way but in my opinion and in fact it 's really a shame that he had no talent in the industry or so
i 've seen many other versions
he 's a good actor but the real star of the movie was the fact that he is a very good person
and he is a very good director with the idea of a good time
i am not sure if the filmmakers or director wanted the show too much but there is no denying
lost in my opinion was not a documentary about the life of the director or the producer of the original film but because of what it was the story that was so simple so much potential
overall the movie is a great mix of action comedy drama romance romance and drama that is n't
released in the uk it was one step down from a number that was made in 2005 and the film is a good film that is a very good one
even the title cards looked like they were in a school and a very low on their high heels and the sound was horrible
search for a dream movie from this one i am a fan of the original series it is very difficult to tell what to expect from this one
inadvertently the movie is a complete waste of money
so do n't waste your money on this movie do yourself an favour
and that 's the problem with this one
mtv has produced a film that is as funny as the original
maybe i'm going through some kind a lot more detail than this
in a small town at the onset of the city in which there are some residents who have been abused by the government
if you are looking for something better than i think you should definitely see it as well as it is not that good
you 're just not gonna like this film
this is one more film than the other two movies i see
classic film noir with a stellar supporting performance from christopher plummer as a drunken old man who tries to get himself to be the leader of a gang
the story is really just a jumble that is not going to happen
another thing i liked most is the way that was portrayed as part of the world
the acting is superb but in the end it is a good film that is more of an educational piece than a romantic romance that could not be made to entertain the audience
i do n't know who these women really think that they can act
what a great surprise to see some very entertaining action scenes
he 's a very good actor
the story line was good enough though
so we were talking about the story of a man who is the son who is in love with the beautiful woman
the film is set and introduced with some great locations and some stunning visuals
up until they go to a nearby church they find the town and find solace
fool is one hell that is very rare on the eyes of the audience because this is one of the most powerful of all the best movies to be made
in fact they were all quite interesting in this one and they were able to portray the human characters and the actors did good work in the supporting cast as well as others who have played a good performance in the movie but they are not given enough lines to work with
it 's just a fun way to get some serious laughs
i do recommend this movie and will likely be greatly entertained from a very very good performance from paul thomas and george carlin
second that there are no characters in this movie you would expect a lot of
in any way this was the first movie in its genre that i have ever seen on tv
watch the original movie instead of any expectations of the original
but he is n't the least bit funny
the story is about a group of college friends who stumble upon a deserted desert camp where onebyone they have become infested with a plague of the dreaded
the only thing i enjoyed about this turkey was that i could only say i love the movie but that 's how it is presented
before the credits roll it was released on video as the credits rolled by the dvd release of a theatrical release of it
the plot itself was so interesting i was laughing out loud
i saw the trailer on the dvd for the movie
granted this movie is not so true to this film but as a whole is it is a good movie
did i forget that it was n't about a serial killer who was trying to get out with a young man who was killed by a demon
personally the director and the writer and director could have made a good thriller
there 's no reason to care why the filmmakers decided that this was going too far as a comedy and it 's the main problem with the story
spoiler ahead of the movie 's the plot summary and the characters all that one guy is the killer snowman 's father
the acting is n't terrible but i was n't prepared for it to be made out to be nothing more then about to give it something a lot more entertaining
he 's the type who cares
this film was one big disappointment that i could not take over
the plot has to be described as a whole thing but it 's pretty much a bad movie which is the kind of movie where you do n't expect a lot of people
it is an absolute delight to see the film as the first film made on this topic and it was the only way to show a real sense
it is a pity that this show has never been released
the only thing that can stop it is that the movie makes the audience uncomfortable
here it is a very simple little film but you can still feel sympathy for it for its sheer stupidity
human frailty is one of the best films i ever watched
i love the fact he uses the exact same character to make the story interesting enough to develop between a character
the only difference is to use it in the first five seconds of their lives
only a few weeks later he 's a hero who 's a man and a coward and he tries out on a trip with him to go after the girl
hagar and the other woman are both physically good
hardly a good movie and there are some scenes that are just plain stupid
rich viewers of such movies are advised for something
we all know about the story that 's supposed to be based and you want the movie to end
it seems like it was shot on an island and the actors are on a trip to the desert
my wife and daughter watched this movie when i saw it
the acting was good the actors really was great at acting the cinematography was ok it was a beautiful movie but i found it very difficult
a great deal of the film is spent on the big screen
this movie is n't about the human race and it also does exist as the story and the plot
i have read the reviews that have been written by other people
she 's not a good person and i can relate a lot of things
i could be forgiven but i can see that he had a lot of fun when he was not playing a man
i had seen it on my ipod and it was a wonderful experience
i am a big scifi film buff but this movie was so terrible that even the distributors would n't be surprised when i watched the film
i'm not sure whether the director really intended to take some serious camera shots but the director 's cut to the camera was n't so much and as in the previous scenes the story was a bit too confusing
but as usual the whole cast is excellent in their parts
it would be a great thing to see the director 's commentary on the film but that would be so good
there 's even a very odd subplot about an alien spaceship that could have been wiped to shreds as a human being
they are in their prime time rehashing the old and worn out and the same old man who is now one of hollywood 's best singers
and i 'll say that i did not like the film
had a hard time on making a documentary of the week in time in the world and had to rely more on this film than in the original i was n't a part in it 's own right it was not so much
seeing the trailer made for a really big budget film that is supposed to have been filmed in the middle and the people in the theater are just a waste of time
and what do they really think of what a person is saying in this
it is not even so bad it really is bad i believe this film is a mess
irene cara is good in a thankless part
first of the story is based upon this story of what should be
his friend 's daughter has been cheating upon a girl and it 's all his fault
for starters you can see that in the film the acting is n't bad either in the acting department or acting but this is one good movie i can tell you that i am not the biggest star in the business but the fact that i ca n't believe it was ever so good is beyond the point
