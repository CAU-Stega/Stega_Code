and that 's about how it works for me as to what is going on here
at the very least you get a movie that is n't so funny that you do n't have to be the type to understand it or you do not understand it
fear is one of the best movies i have yet seen and the one thing you do n't like was the fact you could have done it
it would be interesting to see a film like the one in the hands of a talented director
saw a screener of this film on cable tv and i had never heard it had been released
the plot is simple and the movie is not about a family that has been abused by the taliban and the other is a bit different from what happened to them and the result is a very simple film
believe 's a great show but it was not
this is a really good movie
the first time the same director and producer came from the studio studio was the director and the other two were the only ones in which the story could have been filmed
the first part to the movie is very good as the first one is pretty funny
i would n't say i liked it but it was the most enjoyable movie i have had the displeasure to see in a very short long time
i 've just seen it on tv in an attempt and it was so funny that it could have been more
it has a few good points and a great script
in fact i was a fan of a film about a young lady and the woman who went through a lot of trouble in the first half
i was a little skeptical about this movie and i think it is a waste of my life
max has done a lot for him since i was a boy
for a long time the movie is a bit boring
despite the fact it has been released on dvd this movie has been done many times over by the same director
sir sam raimi has a very nice cameo as a psychiatrist and the two lead male are all very good
i was very impressed by this movie
this film is just a bad movie
this is n't even a good film or a bad movie
that was my opinion and i think that it is a great movie
it 's all so bad and the movie just does n't even work
it 's a good idea for the movie but it 's not as bad
the script is so bad it 's hard to describe
i do agree that the film is about the best in film business
elizabeth hurley plays the mother and the rest of them
she has been the only person in this movie who can actually act like a woman
but if it was made clear that the director of this film had the intention to create another film about the holocaust of the 20th centuryfox and how much they were to do that the movie would be a complete bore but i think the producers have done a lot of work and i would have thought that the movie would be good and it was not
ritter 's acting as an adult actor does seem very good as well as the character of a young angus who is a good actor to watch and a very believable portrayal of what life is like in a real life
if it were n't for that it would not have been a classic
in one of the most memorable moments of film noir i 've seen the movie i thought it was a good idea for a film and was not just a comedy that had a few moments of unintentional humor
tim thomerson plays the role very good
when the first half of the film takes place in a world where the world is ruled it 's a pity
i was hoping to see it to the big screen but this movie is a dud
on the other hand i was impressed at how the movie was going
who can forget to be so engrossed in a film that they are all very very good and so good that the movie just looks good and it is n't
that 's a big question of a movie
anyone who is interested in the history of the genre knows anything about it
dean martin was the only reason i gave the film the benefit of the doubt
if this was supposed for a reason i would n't be surprised
only in the end he gets the idea that he can do a 180 in time for the next hour
once in the movie i could n't stop laughing at how funny it is but i do n't understand why they did n't try to make the movie funny and the director just does not have the guts of making a coherent movie
a good film but a lot more fun
he is not a very talented writer
i do think it 's a good movie
although there are some very funny moments the movie just is a little too serious for me and i just could have done without a laugh track
and it has a few interesting twists and turns
i think this is one to remember
the story is about the same thing as a typical teen flick but it 's still fun
this is a movie about the real life of a child
nancy 's character is so annoying and so annoying she 's barely convincing
so it was a very poor movie
one of the most important and most disturbing aspects ever filmed
and the movie has a very nice ending that is not a happy ending for you
the movie is a total downer
then i went to see the movie
now this is one film that will never be released and should be forgotten in all countries
we are not told about how to go and why they are all connected to it
if you are a diehard john lennon fans or like the other films he has the same cast you will see that this is n't even worth checking it
oh and the soundtrack is not really good either
shortly thereafter they have to go to the house of a little more time
we are shown that the movie is not a drama but it does
he 's just plain awful as he is in fact a bit of his character
that would have been much more believable as he had a bit more depth
even if you have n't seen it you will be surprised that i do n't think of anything like what i have said
obviously it has the same sort of impact in this film and is probably a good film for a lot but the story is a little different for the film 's characters and the characters are developed to be a very believable and powerful character
like the previous comment this is a good film that i think was good enough to watch
strangler has a great plot that keeps me guessing and keeps a smile on your faces but it 's just boring and not very good either but not a great one
well the film has a few good points but the story is not as bad as some say
director david cronenberg 's direction has succeeded in creating a very disturbing and disturbing story
for the first half of a century they have a new relationship with each of their own men
that said the film was shot in the same location as the film 's budget
it 's a very interesting and original movie
great film for a laugh and a good dose
angry and cruel he escapes a long time
the movie starts off very slow and slow and is n't quite exciting
for instance when the woman in a mental ward is asked by a stranger to the local police officer who was involved she would have been able of the crime and that 's a lot more
i'm still trying to figure if it has a few good actors and i do not agree that it is just a movie that should never end
in a nutshell this is a very good movie that deserves the oscar for being on mst3k and i would say
wish they 'd have the chance
also starring the cast and the script are very good
really it 's not a movie to be seen by anyone
they are not a very bad person but it is the worst acting you can ever imagine and i can imagine why this movie sucks
well the movie is pretty good
and the movie itself is n't bad it 's just bad bad awful
while the story of the movie is very similar to the original it was a little slow
it was not the most original movie of the whole bunch
the movie does get a few laughs but it never fails in the least it 's so dull that it makes a few of those films so bad it is actually fun
most of these are the best i can remember
ann russo and robert montgomery do n't seem very convincing at first but this is a pretty decent movie and the acting is excellent
writerdirector richard j brooks has a very funny cameo but the story is very poor and it has many holes
the story line is so ridiculous that i could n't even watch any more episodes
we have a group who have been in prison for the past 10 years and the movie ends abruptly
you have to wonder if the director or the director had to make a real sequel to one 's own novel or the other
this movie is a real shame and is not only a very poor attempt but it 's just a bad movie that i have never seen so i cannot believe i have ever seen a good film
most movies have to be made and this has a very special effect on them but there were also a lot more than the few parts and the whole thing did a pretty bad acting job of portraying a person that was so obviously in love with a different story that he did n't know what to like
although i was expecting some more than i could chew the film to the end it seemed like it was a little long after watching
perhaps they are all that to be the next movie
overall i would highly disagree to watch it
even the title song and dance sequence was pretty much a little too much of an annoyance
i 've read several reviews that stated the film
i'm sure the film is n't that good at least not as good but not as bad or bad as it is and not in a good way like that
the script for a movie that revolves so heavily on the story that i found myself nodding off of the screen to the screen and the dialog in the background of the story was completely unbelievable
frankly i would have to say that this is a very bad film it is not a total failure
but that 's not all bad enough
if i had to pick up my own review i 'd say it 's the funniest thing ever
i think the film is a bit too slow for the whole
if the film is a satire in the way it explores the issue of racism and how a woman is treated in such an aggressive way that she should be able of the world of the holocaust and not only for being the first person who has been able to communicate with a woman
although the plot is a bit contrived it 's still a very good movie with good performances and a great performance from the whole cast and the acting
riding the line between the main stream and the bad guy who has been trying too much to do his work is a very good idea to show it
the only thing i can say is that the whole thing is just as good as it should of been
but the movie is a little dull and the acting is not that good
john carradine was good but the movie was just a bad waste for me
there 's a lot of things happening in the movie that do not make for one good thing to make up for
you know you have to watch this movie
this was not the first movie i have been watching
within the same time it 's a film about a boy in his place who 's a teenager
the script by john waters is very well researched and the direction is flawless and the story itself has a lot more to offer but a lot more of it
you could probably tell that there is a bit of humor but there 's also some gratuitous sex scenes which are really funny and it is funny to hear
as a matter the story is not all very bad
the only thing i liked was how did the movie have a very low score that is not a total waste
simon 's character has a lot of screen charisma and i 've never really seen his wife
zulu is an intelligent and loving film that is so much better it 's a shame that the movie did n't get any better
the story is simple and interesting
i think the film is one that i would recommend to anybody interested in the culture
this is one film with a great cast but i do not believe the acting is so bad that the plot is really hard to find the story of the movie that was so good i was able to relate and i had to get my monies worth
but there is some kind to be said
and it 's not all that bad
the only good part about this movie however is that it does not have a lot more action
the story of two women living with their family and their parents and their friends and their lives in life is a real treat
the plot is not that bad and i do not really care
this movie does n't have any other way to make the audience care what happened
my favorite part of all is how they can do the same thing with the movie as the main characters are the best
all in one and only the occasional and cheerful and very short running of this film that has been seen to the extent that it is n't a complete disaster but a movie with a little romance thrown together in a way of life that you will never get tired
this was the first of its kind of movie to make a new feature movie
when he arrives to his house they find out that the girl has been a werewolf
merging all that aside i think it is one that the best director 's movie is the one that is n't even funny
my friends and i both agreed to see this movie at their local annual film theater and i loved every minute of their lives
the movie was a complete disaster
the story is about the struggle between the characters and the way it is presented in an interesting manner
after a few seconds he has a girlfriend and a daughter and his father who was a little too much like me
what 's the purpose here is that the movie is a total waste
but there is no reason that the film is n't even worth watching in the first two parts of the film and it is almost as much fun
secondly i think it 's not a bad movie either
obsessed with the most famous characters in a long long time and their relationships to the audience the film is just a piece that is so dull
the acting is pretty awful and is just too boring
were they trying to do a little too hard
also the acting was horrible the directing was poor
i 've never seen a movie actively uttering this kind of story
my favorite line is that the two girls were killed in two separate ways and that it is the same thing
still the story is n't as good a performance but it 's just good
he is a real person in this movie who cares about the problems
you can do a lot of movies for the most part but that 's about how they managed this movie
in addition to the movie 's plot and dialogue there is a certain charm in it that i cannot understand
kane was also a very good character and it was nice seeing his character
and then the film cuts into a whole lot more than that but it has the best of everything
i am not kidding that they have all been given a good opportunity to show the world of this world
he does n't seem to be a real person
did you know this was made during the early 90 's
the acting the plot is so bad it makes the whole movie completely worthless to sit there and the characters are so stupid that there is no real reason to be involved in this piece it 's just the same
brotherhood of the dead is not only the worst sequel to the series
after a very long time i was thinking that this was going through some very different levels
when i first started it i was so impressed that the show was canceled in the uk on the big screen and the acting was so bad it was good
over all this movie was a waste of time and a must see
a few scenes are just plain dumb
the film also stars a young kirsten bynes as the woman who is n't afraid for it to take the cake
now i am not the only person who thinks that 's a good thing
ninety minutes into the picture it is revealed that he is going nowhere to be a killer who 's only in the movie to do a few things
hes the last one to die
hollywood 's direction is also quite effective
telly fisher 's first film was a bit too long after the first 15 odd minutes
character development and acting all contribute to the mix of characters and a lot of the scenes with characters
it was a waste on the movie and it was just plain dumb
why would you watch this movie for the second time
and that 's the whole plot
if you 've never read a biography of a book by yourself or you 're into that sort of thing you will find this movie to have been a complete mess of mine
catchphrases are not the same for me it is n't
at the end when the movie is n't a bad film it is not
seldom has the movie captured my heart
dominic morita as usual in the title role is a bit of fun to look at but he 's still a little tough for a role of his own in the role
coming out of the blue to get the most famous movie ever to appear as a horror film the director of a classic movie that was obviously trying to be a success
all this is supposed to make you laugh out loud
just because it 's a movie is not a compliment
like a lot of the movie the characters and situations are just the ones in it
please do n't go see this
the first one is a good example of what a great actor he is and how to act a little bit
i was n't expecting a much much more indepth movie
it is a very simple story of love between an old man who lives his life and his love for him
why the heck were n't they trying to keep the audience 's brain away at all times that the film never had the guts to do
the only reason i even saw this movie was that it was n't released theatrically
like a little kid you know how the people they were born
i am surprised that he did n't receive such awards to the director and cast members and crew of the film
virginia chabert is the only highlight of that picture
he is an actor who is a very good actor and has a very funny cameo in this movie and his character is very funny and has the funniest lines of dialogue
those people who do n't know anything from the film and have seen them do n't have any idea to make them care
these are two people who have seen the movie before they were so obviously the director and a director
their acting was very good but it did not work
owen 's life is n't a complete waste as far from the one i 've seen
a lot more than a few years ago i had to go to the movies to see it
the movie has some good acting and some nice touches on how the world of war works but the movie fails miserably
oddly enough the film is a bit too long and i have to admit that it 's one of many movies i liked it 's best and it was great to watch and i really loved the way this was filmed
if the film does a good thing it 's a waste of time
catherine zeta jones is also in it as well
here we have the two leading actors who do a very good job and it shows the different sides of the real life of life in the early days as well
this movie was so good that it was actually quite funny
were there any other actors or actresses with such a bad script that they just did n't want to be
secondly the story is very good
i think the film is a masterpiece of art in terms and in general in the past
but the real problem here the movie 's plot
this film has a special effect for a movie about an aging young woman who is not in the world of her life
if this movie does n't try it should never have been made
even the music is awful and the plot of this thing is just bad
in fact the only person who was able to make me feel that it 's a little too late to be the most stupid guy in the movie
sam raimi 's film takes a bizarre approach to the original and i think it 's very fitting to a film of the sort that can be viewed at the very least possible
it 's a shame the film did n't work
it 's not a good film at least not for the sake of having the chance to sit back and enjoy the film
she looks like a young woman in school and she 's not really the only actress in it to be a bit more annoying than the other girls who are n't given her acting ability at least not as an actress
despite the title and some other comments the acting was pretty good
irina palm is a good movie
i do n't think it will ever be released on dvd or vhs or purchase or download a copy of it
i would have given it an 8 if the first movie i had to watch it
this is a movie that has the potential to become one thing
i 've seen some great movies in the past but this movie is the exception
another thing that i liked was a good script that was written by a young woman who 's a very nice girl and her mother and the daughter are a bit more realistic
instead it is not that bad
it was n't even worth a watch
at least in this movie the actors seem pretty natural and the director should have been proud of them
the movie starts with a bang on an airplane and the end credits are so bad it could be used to describe the sequel
in my opinion it is a must for all fans and the squeamish to see
and that is a very funny film and the fact that the director 's vision of the film was so much over the top and the way in which the director had his head examined the plot as well as the book does have the meaning to be a good example of a movie and it 's not a film about a subject
i would give this a zero out of 10 for being a zero
where was the story and story
the only thing that makes one stand is that the plot is pretty thin
but it is still one that makes you laugh and laugh at its stupidity that it 's not only funny but it 's also a good movie
if you have n't read this and you are a fan of john woo movies do n't bother with this one
do yourself a favor and do n't go see the movie and think this will end
its a good movie and if it is n't for it 's bad acting it does n't work at all and the ending leaves the audience wondering why they did this movie at all and how the ending was going to turn into something that did nothing to do in a good movie but the acting sucked it is the worst i have ever seen
thus the film is set to the point of being in the world and that we get to see the film that has the power of the original story
i have to admit that i'm a sucker of the art of the original film
the first half of it seems like it was set in a real unspecified town
watching the movie i could n't help but feel that there was a lot more going in between these two people
she looks like she 's a child of sorts and the rest was pretty much just a bunch
the plot is simple but that 's just enough for a good movie to make a better movie than this
wayne 's character was so unlikable and so unlikable i felt like you were supposed the screws
no matter what you are talking about or you want you to go into the theater and enjoy it
michael dudikoff plays a man named john wayne a man whose life depends on his personal problems and he has a girlfriend named dink in the middle of the night and that is all
some people say it 's not as funny as it sounds
and if it were n't enough it is not a very funny thing
he has a great sense of style
the movie is a good film that makes you laugh
after a while we get the feeling he has been drugged by a man and it is the worst he can get away
the film is n't even a classic film
it was a good idea that i was going to be able to sit down in the aisles and watch it with a straight to hard time
to me this movie was a waste over an hour of my life
it 's not all that bad either the acting is awful as in the other actors who did so
listen to it on the other side
and there 's a few good moments in the entire film
i was so shocked at how bad it really was and it was even funnier for the viewer
for those who enjoy movies that have a very strong plot line and good action scenes and a good script this film is worth checking
a good film to start with a good plot twists and turns
this was a great movie for me
so it 's a film that is worth watching if you are a fan and you are a fan of john wayne
but it 's not the first time we see the original it 's a good one
colossus is an amazing movie with its own unique and very moving plot and an interesting twist to the whole movie
what i really do remember about it was that it was a little too long and the characters had a lot of potential
if you are not a fan you wo to understand what the story is about and the ending is so contrived that you ca only make you want to kill yourself
a film like this can be made available to the public library as well as the fact the filmmakers are making films with a limited budget and a few extras that are good enough
it 's all that the plot revolves on a young man named sam who has to deal with the consequences and problems of her
we get an endless stream of events in which the film becomes increasingly static
the story line has been done to death by an unknown director
i would have given this movie a higher rating but it is very much like that
near a climax i was expecting a more serious movie
i was n't even sure where to start with this film but i do n't know it was a bad one and it was n't as entertaining as i had hoped i had
albums were very much a little too common with a movie
so what 's the point here
a film like this should be required to make more of the movie
the only thing i really liked was how the hell did they get to this part
this is a pretty good film but it does a good job of showing a lot of people who are n't in the movie and they are n't all there
not to be taken to the level by the end of the movie
i was surprised to learn this was a good movie
this was n't a movie to be taken seriously but it was a good film to be sure
although i did see that the movie had a little more depth it 's more of a comedy than the film itself
thus the movie is a bit over a long drawnout mess which does n't quite reach the climax with its predictable plot twists
he 's the only one who gets his own way
joao has a small role in the role of the dictator
chevy kilmer is great as the villain he 's always in a class of what looks to be in real life
lastly it was not for kids but i loved it
while i am not a fan of these movies i think that they were made in the past
my advice is that you 'll find it and watch the movie because it 's just so funny that i could watch it again and again but it was n't funny at first i did laugh at the jokes and jokes of all the gags
this is a movie that will leave you wondering how much of the story line is going on and it 's very very difficult to tell whether it 's just trying hard or the plot
my only complaint is when it comes to this movie i think that 's not the problem
too bad they did n't make a sequel and they just got the money to do this
this is the kind that makes this film a must
the story is about a man who wants to make his living
the film is a complete mess
almost every scene is a joke
this one is about the worst thing i can come across
yeah it 's the worst thing about the film
in this film he has a great voice
seldom do we get an explanation of the situation that is in
for the most time you 're a fan of any type of film
who can blame the film for the fact that it 's a movie that is not only a vehicle to see it 's a documentary but to see how it can get
he also had the nerve to take some of his friends to see
as a matter it 's not worth your trouble but if you have a chance to watch it and you are a fan then watch the first two movies and you have to be very good with the first two movies in which this is filmed in their entirety
following her as a woman and her lover 's sister in her own little town she finds herself in a relationship with her family in the country
although there is a little bit to this movie the story is a little slow
sam neill as the father and the son is a bit too much like a normal man with no knowledge of him
the only real drawback in the script is that it is not really funny
that was a lot of the time
and the acting was terrible as hell was the worst i have ever seen in my life i was n't even sure what the hell is going wrong with the movie it is so bad that there is no excuse to give it to the viewer that they do not have enough money to pay to get to the bottom the movie is crap to watch
mehmet ali erbil is excellent as a man in this movie
they all do a good job of bringing out a great cast of the leads of a very good film and the acting is great
from the moment they are trying to save the day and their car they decide that the house will turn to the dead man who is the killer of the killer
soon enough he 's a young boy who is a little bit puzzled by the fact that the mother and the sister is married to a girl in a hospital
save yourselves the bother and skip it and go for something like a marathon
the film is a good example for some of the worst films i have seen in a long day i ca n't say enough about it but it 's a good movie
spongebob was a bad guy in a rubber coat in leather
watch this movie if you want a laugh and laugh at a film
i was hoping that the writer had to get a little more effort
see this film at the theater and you will be disappointed
i do n't want my comments to describe that this one has the best and worst of them all
the story and acting is good
against this backdrop and the fact that the movie does n't have to get any more than its own right is a pretty enjoyable film
i do recommend the movie for everyone who has seen a movie or a film about a dysfunctional life and a love affair in a very sad way
to sum it off there is an obvious lack as a whole
and i 've always liked the music in the movie
i was a fan and i am very impressed with this series as a kid
it has a very simple plot and the actors are great
this is a great film to have to see if you have n't
it 's a shame the only negatives are that they did n't have the money
it 's a movie about the dangers of friendship in the middle east
i have to mention that this movie is the biggest selling of a long career
the acting is horrible the directing is atrocious the story was ridiculous and i think the worst thing i can say about the movie is that it tries to make you laugh
but it really gets me to like to see it all and if you 're in the right frame and want to get away with the movie it 's worth
after all this is one of those movies you want not want you to watch
just because he did n't do anything about him
great performances by all involved especially from a few minor characters who are a real pleasure
it is a story of a man who is a little of the way to an end in the world of which to protect her life
this movie is so good you ca n't even get it on the air to make it worth watching
if you have the chance for a movie you should see the movie and enjoy it
if i could get my hands down i would not have made a mistake
although he was not only a very good actor he was also quite good as a tough girl
that was my only gripe with this film that i had no interest in seeing it
even though the movie is a bit slow it does n't take place too soon
i am still wondering why anyone would watch this crap
the film is a great example of what a movie should be
the movie is about a family that is a little over a century
the only redeeming feature of all this series was that it made me want to vomit
even the title song is sung by a man of the highest caliber and it 's hard not to like a character that 's a real prick and a little annoying but that 's just not your average
never do i feel the urge
many movies have to do with an allstar director who is the most popular director
martin scorsese is a great director but this is n't the case with him
on one level it 's a bit like another movie with the main cast a bit more of the dialogue but that 's a minor problem and the acting is poor the acting is awful the script is awful the script is awful and the story line is awful and not funny at the same point
it is a good idea to see a more serious and original film
garfield 's film was made in the us and was not to say that his film is not as accurate as in the first film the acting is good
it 's an interesting idea to make a film for a few hours
do n't get your hands on it
the acting by the leads was superb
from the beginning of his movie the viewer is left wondering why he has the answers to the truth he is trying to do with this movie but that does n't make it much more work and it 's not even his character
what the hell was this supposed
by the end of the movie it was clear that the film makers had been conditioned to create such an atmosphere for their audience that it did a lot to relieve its shortcomings to a broader audience
show us the world we live and how can you be
welcome to this story is the fact i am not sure why this film got the rave reviews i have read about it i do agree
despite the shortcomings of the film the film is still entertaining and enjoyable
there is a scene where the two men get their asses chopped down and the camera pans out and the scene is shot with a bare hand in the back yard
the only saving graces of this movie are that it 's a complete waste for one and for the money it has nothing else
it 's a shame the film is n't available in the us but rather as soon as it came out on dvd in the near 50 's
this is not a movie that 's supposed as an homage to other films like cannibal holocaust
looking at the movie in the first place is pretty bad
kenneth howard is a good choice for this movie but i think he 's a very good actor
sue and the other actors are very good in supporting cast
though it has a few moments that are just too silly and stupid to make you care about them there is nothing else
this film is a very good example for those that are not the type of person that wants a child and a woman who loves to hate her
i have to say that this is one movie
it 's a real treat to be sure
trying hard to be a bit of fun
the film is a bit of fun in parts
it is a story of two friends who live in a mansion in the middle class
bizarrely it is a little dated and the plot itself was a joke
3 the scene in the bar where the two women are talking to each other in a room
so much for the movie that was the first movie
and if you 've never seen a movie that i can think about again this is the first that has the look and feel of being a little over a century and a waste but it 's very well done
some say this is an excellent film but that 's not what i call a movie
listening to the movie and the film it makes me feel a sense of nostalgia
just as the film is about a man trying to kill and killing the women
totally unrealistic and a bit of the spoof movie i think it was a great choice to get the dvd
snoop dogg is a very good actor but it 's hard not to feel sorry for these guys
did he know his character in a real life
doug mcclure does a fantastic performance but he 's also the only one who can save this
a movie that is n't bad
it 's a pity it did not get nominated for a academy nomination
i was expecting a good movie and i could n't help but think that the movie had a good cast
whereas the film was a complete waste on film and it was not a big hit and it is n't
as an example of how many films they are made is a great film
the only reason this is not even a movie is that it is in some parts a little more serious
while it was not the most popular film i have seen in a while it was very disappointing to watch and not just in the case of the movie
louis gossett jr was a bit more believable
still the script is so good
a few years later she has become a success for her own family and friends
this is a film that is definitely not a waste for a dvd of a classic
normally i am not impressed with a movie
it has a good cast and a story of people that are so bad they ca n't do anything to save a movie
played to the hilt is one that i would not recommend watching
the only saving grace in this movie are the performances of robert downey jr and the supporting characters
a lot of people who liked this movie were probably too old to make a mistake of making it a success
donna 's dad is killed by the local police chief
they are n't so bad it looks good but it 's really bad and it 's a bit too long
other people have commented on this movie
rambo returns to his home town in order for the new world
what was the deal with this movie at all cost a lot of bucks for
um if you 've got a lot to do n't get the dvd of the movie this is probably one of my all for a good time period
i have never been a big john goodman but i have n't seen the first three and i 've already seen the first film that i would n't have liked
it also has the most beautiful and haunting music score i saw this year and the most memorable part was the song the music the music
the plot of this movie revolves on a group of teenagers who decide that they must spend the night to save the planet from an old friend named sosuke
this is not a film for you but you will be disappointed
no matter how hard you try you 'll have to watch it
the movie is n't about anything but a bunch of boring people doing the same
making it a must for all fans of the genre will probably not be disappointed to the point of view and not to be spoonfed for the masses
then the movie switches gears and it 's not just a bunch of random jokes
most of the movie is about sex in the city and in the end it becomes very annoying
it was a good idea the acting was ok the actors did great job and i was impressed that they did n't get a bigger screen time
horrified me the film is n't so bad it 's awful
the movie is so bad that i could have spent more than a week trying it
evil dead man 's death on earth and a few other characters that are supposed to be the real killer of the movie
as a result the movie is not only a visual experience but a documentary that does n't have to be the most
it is a movie that should be shown with the family
that is what makes it so funny but it is still very funny
what is the deal with all the other characters in this movie
it 's like they 're trying to make the whole movie look cheaper
there was a lot to be expected to be a movie like the movie and it was n't
it has no plot to speak at the beginning
the first part was a little slow but the story is so good that it makes you feel like you were watching a movie with a few friends and a few of them
it has been said in a very long review that the movie is a total waste of my life for the first half
i 've seen this film twice and i have to confess i am not a big fan
i was so shocked i decided to give this one a try because it looked like it was made by another 12 minute student who 's not really a good director but the script is good
it has a very interesting storyline a good script good direction great acting great music
there 's an excellent amount to the cast
i have never read the novel and i have n't read the books
you 're not sure if the movie was a good or not even worse but i think the film is a bit too long
if this was the case then why not bother to make an effort to make it onto a shelf
so i do n't know how to make a movie
most notable is that i am aware of the fact the film 's plot has changed the same basic idea that the original film has the most artistically successful story of the film
the movie is not even worth a second viewing but it 's very enjoyable with the cast the excellent and very talented barbara turner in it
he 's an idiot who 's a big fat guy
as far from being a great movie a must see for anyone that likes to watch movies and a bit more than just watching the first
but there was no need for this show to show the kids in real life and the characters are so unrealistic they are not funny anymore and it really shows us how the characters are
that 's the way i think the story is about
there is a great performance from the actors
i was very disappointed at this movie
and the story itself is very good as well as the music
well i do n't know why i never read the books of it before the film was released
i think this is an example of the movie 's appeal
later he is a bit reluctant to be taken to the hospital
probably the only film that i can remember that had a budget to work in
i'm a fan and have never been so annoyed by this movie since it is a long long lost
and if the movie is so funny it is the best i have ever seen
it is not a bad film
guy is a bit of an egotistical loser
one day a girl is a little boy and she 's the girl who is n't a virgin and it seems the director was trying to tell us a story without a shred of depth
watching the movie as a child it was very funny
i have seen it over 20 times and i still do n't think the director 's name is too good
insensitive characters and situations that seem to come together as the film progresses
i 've seen some really bad stuff from the last few years
a few of them were pretty bad but it was still very good fun
i 've heard that the film is a little over the place as a comedy but it 's just not funny
finally the story is about a woman named angela who is sent by her friend and uncle to marry his wife but he 's not so far away
japan has a great deal to be a great movie
the movie is a total waste on the worst possible effort
the plot is so weak that i have a headache in it
4 the film is so bad the whole point of view of the film was that the story could have been a little bit better
just do n't see this film at all
but then again there are some things that are so good you 'll be able with the story and you 'll feel sorry
i'm sure that they 're not a fan
especially in the end of the story when the young man is revealed the truth is that he 's the killer
being a fan of his work i was expecting that the film was made for the first hour
naturally it is a film with a great soundtrack and great performances of all involved but i have seen worse
in fact this is an excellent piece of filmmaking that has all of those qualities that i would love to see
this movie is the best of the series and is one reason for watching
otherwise it 's an awful and dull movie that does n't make it to the top of the list of worst movie i have yet to get to see
i 've been looking forward to seeing a good movie in the years but this one is n't one that was made to look like a movie
i was so annoyed that my dad bought the dvd
i 've been waiting for something better to happen and this is a really good movie
and that is the way the characters are portrayed to be
however it 's still an awesome movie for the whole family and will appeal to anyone
quoting that this was the worst movie i have had to sit with in the theater i do n't think that it would be funny
the story line is about a bunch in the north of france
thank god that it is the last movie i 've seen that makes a whole movie to come out
the film also has an interesting storyline and good acting performances from robert mitchum
this is just a bad film
it is the story of the love for a girl and the consequences to a young man to get married and live a quiet life in the city with a very strict attitude and a little of a life
first let me start by telling you the story
it is a film that is full of action and is not a comedy
from the very first minute of a second the viewer sees the man 's life as he is revealed
example of a film that was n't so well written and directed
tyrone power is a very beautiful and talented actor
there was a lot that could n't have been better than this crap
dw griffith 's acting is a bit stiff and the dialogue seems like a bad student of bad soap opera but it is a bit of a letdown to sit down and watch
exactly what was the deal for the film
you can watch it to the end
the film was made with no budget and that the camera was not as big a big budget as the actors in the movie
i have to say that i 've seen better acting from a few actors who have not been able to pull off all these roles and have done so well
the story line was good but the plot line had to do so
get a copy from a friend who has a copy of his work and you have to see it for free because he was not only the best man to ever read the books but he was so obviously a genius in the book
peak to perdition and the rest are just fine
i 've never heard a name of this show
therefor i would rather watch a lot of the same
walter matthau is a fine actor as the young man with whom he has the smarts of a man in his life
it is an interesting film that will never have been made
oliver stone 's film in a few years makes me think and will probably appeal to anyone who likes to laugh
one of my favorite movies was in the same league as in other movies
i was expecting this movie to have a few moments but that does mean things
and it was n't even the story that made it even dumber than the sum
i saw the preview of a documentary on the film and was impressed by its message of what is happening
there have been a number that could be corrected and this is one of those
but i think it would be much better if i could see it
but the real thing about it is that we are not told the whole story of the story
fascistic to the people who made this film it 's so bad that you can make yourself laugh at the stupidity and feel of a film like this one
rupert grint was in it for the role
a lot of the time it 's not even worth your time
prior to being a classic film i have n't yet seen the movie in my life
the plot of the story is very similar and it 's a lot different
it is also about a young and very young woman who moves to new york to visit a small village
it 's also the only film in a similar genre that makes the story more interesting but this is a real bore
and i have to admit there are some very good scenes in my eyes where a man with a heart of gold was trying to seduce him
but it does n't even matter
directed by a master of the highest budget of filmmaking and a good director
then there is an old man in an elevator
rated it highly below par for the whole family i was very pleased to see the film on tv
eli robbins plays the role of an older man
do n't worry about the movie
i would n't want this movie as much as the first one but this one is really awful it is very poorly done it 's not really bad
is there any more of a plot
probably because it is a little too wordy and the story is n't too good
actually the film was a bit of fun
lloyd kaufman was the most talented filmmaker of the late fifties early 70s
indeed he was the only one in a movie that did a good script and had a lot more depth in it
and then there were the many twists that were not explained and i did think the ending could have ended in a good fashion as it seemed the ending was a little bit rushed but the plot is very good and the actors are all pretty good
i was surprised by this film 's title the first time it appeared in the film
a great deal to watch in the movie theater in your life
the film also has a bit but the plot is pretty good too which is n't necessarily a problem to me and i do agree to say that if you like a little too much about action and action you will be bored out of your skull
this movie is about a woman who lives in a small town with her mother and a younger brother
everyone should have a clue of what to do with this show because it 's not the worst
however this is not a bad movie but a great one
when i first saw this movie it was on a low brow and it is not as bad
god bless me for this turkey of course
i was a kid at the time and was not a fan of it
to me it 's a very enjoyable movie with a message about its subject but it 's still pretty good and very funny and it does n't make any serious jokes
this was a waste on the movie industry
here 's where to begin with a bad script a terrible script and bad acting the script was awful the acting was terrible the dialogue was lame and the whole thing was predictable
hard to believe the film 's story is so bad
i was expecting a good movie but this one was so bad that even the distributors should have done it a little less
real fans of the original will be disappointed
i was very surprised that this film had such an impact on the subject matter
on top there are two other examples of this movie
the only saving grace in the film was that it did not take the story and story to the original
there have been some other films that have been a staple of their lives in the late forties and this has a lot of great entertainment
the movie is a great example
this film is not even a comedy
they were also a good actor to look at and a great deal
casting was excellent as is her acting
the story itself is very thin and the acting
the film is an interesting one
this is not a movie that should have stayed with me if i did n't have any of it
they 're so bad they 're so bad they 're all very funny
not much happens in this film
it 's a good movie but it does not matter if the movie is really bad and not worth your time if you are a diehard horror fan
or is it the same thing
they are a little too young to be a good person but they have no redeeming qualities whatsoever to the film and they really have to make their own films to be the worst one
he has a great deal of humor in the film and he makes a great villain
the script is a little contrived but the film is just as funny
all of the actors are great but the script is very weak the acting was horrible it 's a mess
compare to the other films that made the movie a little less interesting
the plot is so bad that it 's impossible to believe that this was a film
i think it was the best movie
bill paxton is excellent as an aging young stud and the young man is a little over his head
for instance i would like to see how a character could be played a bit by himself and he is the one who plays the other characters and he does n't disappoint
the plot line is interesting enough but it was n't enough to make me laugh
the story is about three women living in their youth each summer in an old mansion that is now married to their family and the family
all of the actors in this movie are good in their performances and it is very good to see them perform
here he is in an entirely new york film
a film that should be made aware about the fact that it is a movie about a young girl who is attracted and abused by her family
the story is a joke about the evils that we all have about our society and the struggles
when the movie 's main character dies in a car accident the movie ends
every time a film is shown i am compelled of the opportunity of being to the one that i was so excited and entertained
once the first two are established it 's a very funny and touching film which makes you think
the first movie was about the best war in the world but it 's not
you will get this movie out of your mind
some of the scenes in the movie seem to be improvised by all the people who do this and i think the acting was bad at times
the film is a total mess
while i have not seen the movie the story is very interesting in my opinion
she is a young man in her own right but not very very good at her own
danny boyle 's acting is just plain awful and the plot line is so ridiculous that they just end up making excuses to show some real problems with the movie 's story
you know it 's a great movie and this movie is not even bad but not bad
the film is a great example of how the director could be sued by his friends and their friends
it 's all a bit overdone and the plot has a lot of holes in your head and you can never get a chance for a sequel but this one was very good
imdb rating is the only negative comment on this film it has earned me on a loop
it would 've been nice to have the two stooges in the same place
in addition to a few laughs i laughed my asses hurt off and i laughed a few times but i still found that the jokes in the film were so stupid that i actually cringed
i was hoping that this could be the first movie to come across but i think it 's really a little too slow to be a good movie to begin off
think about it for what is wrong with this film it 's just too slow
that 's all you can say about this show in which you 're supposed for some kind
bottom line this film should be seen to the end with the exception of the title song
you can do this for the fact
he 's not a good guy who has to do things like he 's the guy who 's trying
i was n't really interested in the plot but i really enjoyed the film very well
the acting of all actors is terrible
bronson is one that makes it look like a big hit on the head in the end
there are no other scenes in a movie with a supposed budget of about 1000000 that 's a little too long for it being made
the plot is about a man searching to kill a bunch of young women
i do n't think it is too bad for a good actor like him to play the part of a father or maybe not the person that should have been
a few years later he 's the perfect girl for the title
i 've seen this movie and i do not think i 've read the reviews
welch is very attractive as always
the first one i have to agree that the acting was good the plot was pretty decent and the ending very cool
just a great movie to enjoy if you want the real movie
and i do believe this was supposed to have to have been a long time to go
i have seen the whole movie in my entirety and is still amazed at all that this movie should have been a great movie with some of it 's very good actors and it is a movie worth checking out
now it 's a movie that i will always remember but it 's just that there is nothing funny and it 's not funny to listen at a certain level of humor
as the story begins he begins investigating his life by marrying himself
i am still amazed that the movie was made at the time of it was released but the filmmakers and the writers of the movie have done a wonderful movie and it is not the best film ever made
it is a very enjoyable film that is both visually funny at times touching and well acted
can i say this is a great movie
it 's all the more frustrating for a movie that has a lot more than a few faults and there are some funny moments in it and the rest of it has its charms in the end
it is a great film for those of us that have n't read the story yet and are n't too happy to be there
the film is a very interesting film that does n't make sense
i am not a film critic but i have seen a lot of movies but this was one of the worst
i think the director should have been given some credit to his own character and that 's why he was in it for the movie 's end and it was a bit confusing
you can see the ending and the ending is the only one
it is also a film that should be seen by everyone interested in the art and the time
the only thing the movie had to do was the ending and the ending was really stupid
the script and editing are pretty bad and i think that is the point that i was trying hard and hard to understand
i saw the movie at the 2005 film house and was blown away by it as it was n't
the movie is a complete failure and should be avoided for all
briefly the plot is simple and the ending
a film that has no plot and a little action is not enough to warrant it 's time slot
the story is about a woman named clara who goes to a mental breakdown to search in his old life to save a friend of mine
i was n't disappointed with the film
but this is a really bad film
from the very first scene in this movie i was expecting that the story was good
and then there is the ending
it 's an insult for any viewer to come along and appreciate the fact that it is a complete piece of crap
in this movie we see the young man being beaten by his father who is supposed as a woman as a child and the mother is a child
first of all it 's just a stupid little comedy and is n't even worth your time
for those who are n't into the genre you 're bound for a great film
newcomers were also the only real heroes in any movie
how can the director and director be able to keep us interested in the film
bogart was the perfect man but he was still the most versatile in this film and the only reason why he was in this one was the fact that he was a bad actor
after all the movie 's a little over rated
i would have given this film a lower if i could have given a zero star but it did n't have much to do with the film
the film is a complete mess
i was very disappointed with the film
there is a great story about a woman who is in her own right after her death and the mother has a daughter
it 's an insult for me the first time that i saw this film i had no idea that it was a film or just a good laugh
if it were n't so bad they were just plain stupid
it 's not that it 's not that bad but it does n't
his father is a little too infatuated with the family to be married to each member of the tribe in the country who has been in the military business and is left alone by the same
here the plot is simple and the movie is just so bad it 's almost painful in every way to make a movie
and that 's where i saw the movie the first
tommy is a little more convincing and is a little too cocky
do not watch this if your looking to have your own family
i 've heard many negative remarks about this movie and i do think that it was n't a good movie either
at first the only thing that was good about this film are some of the acting
his acting is so bad that you can almost forgive him
i saw the film in a theatre where my laptop was being fixed
it is the story in which the two men meet in the woods and the relationship that develops between their mutual feelings and their mutual relationship is explored
david carradine is a fine comedian and i hope he will get a lot more screen time
one thing i did not like was the fact that the movie was so awful
to be sure i was not impressed with the ending but rather the film was so bad it is almost laughable at times but it really has to
there are also some good actors in here but that is what makes this movie so good and it 's one that i would recommend for fans who can enjoy it or just watch it on a rainy afternoon
i 've seen this movie a few times and never really liked the movie
the story is about a group that is attacked by a group of friends
just because he does not have a chance to do so does it
the plot is not so bad
it was not a bad film
i would have to say it has been a very low budget film
the film is n't as bad and the plot is not the worst i 've ever seen but it 's definitely not
it has a few moments of humor but it is n't funny
you 'll have the patience to watch this movie again and again
sounds a great film that 's all about a man who kills him
now i'm not going and i can only say that i 've heard a little bit of the story in my opinion
with the exception that the movie is a great deal to watch it has to have some relevance for the audience to understand the plot
this was one of the few films i have viewed
i am surprised by how much the acting is n't as bad but this movie was terrible
the acting in this one is superb and it really is one hell for me to be able to suspend disbelief to watch
only a handful of people who have seen this movie can be very funny and it is the reason i do
the only good part in this movie however was how they had the gall to do a good movie about this movie in that the film has the most interesting characters in the movie but the movie does n't make a whole lot of sense but i think the director was trying very very different than the movie which it is n't very good
its a shame that this film is not available for sale in dvd
the film is a very good one
the only thing that i can think are they 're not funny is the fact that the characters are so stupid they are all funny because of the lack of any chemistry
swayze plays his part as an eccentric cop who tries to get the man out of the world
so it goes a long way to go on
the plot has been done so much better to warrant some of the most important and intriguing aspects of the story and characters
major spoilers ahead the main point is that it has to be one of the funniest films of the year in my estimation
i 've always liked the show
yep there are many ways in the world where you are supposed to believe that it is n't
i'm glad i did n't give this movie a 2 i 'll give the other three thumbs down for the good acting of the actors
i would like to know what the director was thinking and he was a writer
by all accounts a good movie
make a movie of the genre you 've got to have a lot more money than it is
i have a problem with the fact that this film is not as good as it 's a bad movie
the film is also very very slow and the ending does a lot
that being a movie that 's about a bunch and an underaged woman and his girlfriend in a small town
the movie does have an underlying message to it that it 's not that bad but the fact it has no plot and no real characters
some of it 's problems and this is not the worst movie i 've come up with
he had to play a character and his character is the only one who has any depth
the first thing that makes this movie is the soundtrack
unless you 're a diehard asian fan of the genre and you 're the best fan for that kind of thing this is your film
and it 's just so boring to watch
aj 's character in the film was n't a great character but i did n't care about his character
so i can see how this movie was produced and edited
there are a few laughs to this film but i ca n't think anyone could possibly find something like a classic movie or a funny one at all in a fun way
the plot is a little contrived and i do not want that i would n't have to endure a sequel
ok so this movie was n't that bad
maybe the director had a lot to say
this is one of my favorite tv show of the 90
hey yeah it was funny in a funny way but i thought it could be a little better
sweet to the extreme it 's not a very funny thing
sadly it is a bit slow for the movie but it 's also pretty good
it is a movie that is not a good movie
from a technical point of why is a bad thing but the rest of the film is pretty much all bad
what was the point of the movie anyway
black robe was an entertaining movie and i was so surprised that it was a movie
this was a pretty bad idea to make the original movie a good idea
but it 's just not the worst i 've seen in a long day and it is one of the most enjoyable
the acting is pretty decent but it 's just not that much
i think i was really a fan of the movie because the story line is so bad
i saw this film at the 2005 sundance festival in the 1980 's
this is a movie for those of you who enjoy watching a movie that does a really good job
i was expecting the movie to end but i did n't like this one
what 's the deal for the movie is that it is not a movie
i was surprised by this movie
the film has some very good points and the film is a bit dated in spots
i saw this movie at the amsterdam theater
to the person of the director i 'd give this a 7 out 10 but it was n't a very good experience to me it was a waste of time
watch this movie and then watch it
or maybe they 're all going to make up for this
i do n't know what to say about it except that i have n't seen it
last week i saw this again and again in the film 's premier
the acting was terrible and i had no idea what 's going on and i did n't even think the actors were acting
the movie 's plot revolves around the main problem with the original movie as it 's not really the case
the film has a good cast that does n't have to go into a script
and that 's the reason why i love this show
the first part was a bit choppy but then it turned out to be another sequel to this movie
there are a number that will keep a smile out of your face and you 'll find it a very good place
and that 's about how they all get together together
al is not only a very attractive man but he is a very good actor who makes you think and is not only a little too young but a great talent
license of the delta knights are n't the most original
once you see this movie you 'll get the impression that you have to be a good movie to see a good actor like gabrielle in one movie
the acting by the entire movie was pretty good especially for a few scenes
i would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great movie
it was so obvious i wanted the entire film to be so stupid i had to sit through the movie and i was n't even entertained
this is one of the most enjoyable films i have seen
oh yea i 've heard the name is so much more than the sum of the dvd
i have no doubt about it but i do recommend it if your not looking for a good movie with a lot better
i'm still not sure what to say about this film but this film had me hooked
after a while i had to watch it for the first time and i still love to see what happens to me
earlier on the film turns up the last scene of his career as she gets pregnant and he does n't really notice his wife and the other half is a complete btch that the girl was supposed to have a boyfriend and then they 're supposed for the most to do so much
then there 's the music which i did n't really know about the movie
martial artist are n't a bad thing
since they were both good and evil the only way i could identify with this movie is that i did
even the most seasoned actors do some good acting
culturally inaccurate and not very good
i think this is a great film to watch but it certainly is a must see movie not for the faint hearted or simple
i have a feeling that i have a crush on the film 's creator and director
save yourself money and time and money
no one could even have said that this was an awful film it was a waste of time money and money and money and time and money it 's not worth the money
one of his most popular films of the last decade of that period
not much happens in my life
even though it 's not exactly a masterpiece it 's a rather enjoyable movie and it is worth watching
she is the one who 's the most annoying and stupid and she just happens to be her sister so that she can be a real jerk
and that 's all the point is that the movie is n't even funny
and the movie has some very good special effects
you could probably get it out the next day if it had to be released or maybe you should not be fooled
a movie that is just a little bit too good to be a good movie but it was made up for by a bunch of people
wait until the end you realize that there will never get another one but the ending will soon end
watch it alone and i 'll give the film a try and it will be a great movie
the plot has been told by other characters
very good for the entire family but that does make for a very interesting and compelling film
spend all the budget on it
a good example is the way it goes from being in a good way
for all that it was made up for that
but this one is n't that great
i have never laughed so hard at the tv and i have to say that this is a great movie i hope that will someday get lost in the big apple in the future
well i guess i'm a sucker for movies that are bad and this is the one that i 've seen them with such a low budget but i do not think that it deserves better
into a world of the past
when he returns home from a new york town and is reunited with her and the family 's relationship with her and her life is quite a different story than i thought i would do in the book and not in the way i was in
the acting is terrible but the script just plain awful
instead of being able the camera cuts back in a car that makes the film look grainy
it 's a pity that he has a career in this picture and it was the most popular of his
the only reason i gave this movie a 1 instead is that the actors did n't have one
then there are some funny scenes where the girls are trying to escape
anna is also a great actress
i am amazed at how many of the actors i 've watched in the film have their careers and it was a pity that this film was never nominated for any oscars in my opinion but it was a very good film
that 's how this movie sucks
about half way through i was hoping the whole series was going to happen and then it became a bit confusing as i had hoped it had been more
generally speaking the acting is poor
who 's going to make this movie
kathryn danes is excellent as her boyfriend and the movie is a joy to behold
but the movie just does have its moments and the movie is a very interesting movie
the first part of the movie is really really good the first and 3rd part of the story is pretty slow and i do not think that the actors are the main reason to watch it because it 's not really worth watching
yes this is a movie for those interested into the genre genre
john cusak is an actor that is very well acted and the story is a little bit of an adventure
the film is an interesting one and that is n't what it 's cracked up
every time i watch it you 're thinking about it as it is
ambitious but i would have liked some of his actors to be the same actor
half way mark schell is a great actor
instead i saw a couple of bad guys on board
the film is n't as bad as the original it has a few laughs and it 's just not a good movie
a good cast is wasted here but there is a lot of potential in this movie to put them to sleep
everything about his life was just as bad
however in the beginning the story of a girl who is married to a younger woman is played by a young man named cesar
hmmm this was a pretty cool movie that had me guessing
actually it was a good idea for this type of movie
again i was very excited and surprised at the amount i saw on a saturday morning
as the story unfolds he gets to see her in a small town in her country
we have to see the movie and the film will be more than just a collection
nightmarish and creepy but this is one of the few horror flicks i 've watched
i would like this movie to have been a bit more of a drama if it could possibly have been a little bit of an allout drama but there is a lot to the movie that 's good
while the film was a bit long it did not seem that it needed any more
not a lot but it is a very good and enjoyable movie
he 's a very talented actor and a great actor
it 's a movie about the struggle of a young woman who is a teenager but the other characters do a good deal
if you have n't read the novel you should know better the film is a total waste of time
while i have never seen it in quite a long long time it has been one of many films i did not enjoy
he has a great deal going in with his role in a movie about him trying to be a hero and is also a great actor he has some great acting skills
the movie 's main focus was the performance by the actress
the plot is simple and the acting is just terrible and it does n't matter that the film is just too much for the family to enjoy
if the story was so bad it might well have made this movie a bit much better but it is just too slow to waste any of the time
pure crap like this i think it 's one to watch
they did a great job with it but i do not know who it is that
is it any wonder that the movie is just about a man and a woman who have to deal with sex and murder and are very different
firstly the film takes a lot more seriously than the usual suspects
it 's like it was made for no one else
yes the film has a lot of good scenes and some of them
being the first time i ever saw the movie the only thing i could think was that it was a complete waste of my time
disgusted and shocked by the fact that they had to go back together
bronson was a bit too old and was n't funny at the time but i did not expect much from the guy he was supposed to have just been in the movie
he 's an actor who 's always been a good comedian in a movie
this is a great movie for everyone who has seen it you will enjoy the story of the first one
there was a lot to like here
as the film progresses you 're left feeling sorry for the actors in this film and it 's a shame they did not even have to make a sequel in the first 10 minutes
the movie is a complete mess of a movie
it was so bad that i could n't get enough
in short it is not a very good movie but it 's good to watch
then there were some good actors in this movie and it was nice seeing them
a very interesting film and very interesting
i am so glad i did
the acting ranges from one scene into another and the story line is a little weak
i do n't think so i have to say that i have to admit that this is a very enjoyable movie with a good cast a great script a wonderful script and some very fine music
a great cast and a fine cast that makes a great contribution to a great film
for instance when she 's being chased and raped by her boyfriend
the acting is superb the directing a wonderful mix of drama suspense and romance all in one of my favorite parts and i was a little surprised at it
then there were some great performances
naomi papas is a fine character actress
yet the story is so predictable it 's hard to follow
definitely a movie for anyone who is a fan of the series and the film
other reviewers say it 's a bit of a bad movie but it is definitely worth the time and money to see the film it 's not for everyone and it 's not just about the evils that it is
it has a very good plot but it is just not good
many people have said that this is a movie that will be remembered by the casual viewer who will not enjoy the film
the film also shows up to solve the problem in what it means
but the film was not very good
hopefully they 'll stop making movies like this and they will probably get more attention because they have the same problem to the director
describing how to be one of my favorite films i have to admit that it 's a movie that i would recommend watching it for a laugh and i do n't think it could be
this movie is a waste of time unless it 's a comedy and the only funny parts are when the killer is killed by a zombie in the woods
wait and see if the director 's cut is n't
definitely worth the watch but the film is worth the price of admission alone for the performance
most of all the story lines were very predictable and i was really surprised to find out why there is n't a plot to be told and why
in my opinion i have to say that this show was so funny i was laughing so hard when i watched it that i was actually amazed
when you are n't a fan of the tv movie you 've never heard of it before but still i have to say i was not disappointed
honestly i think that 's how i could handle this movie
the plot is simple a bunch and a group is in trouble with the two factions of the pioneers of the caribbean and their families to take the place
the story line is just plain ridiculous
of interest in this story it is a film that is about a young woman 's struggle to become a successful singer for her
as the story of the film begins to evolve into an interesting plot the main characters are introduced to some other things that happen in the first half of the story but the movie has a certain charm that is ultimately impossible to follow
i have to say that i was impressed
starts a bit slow in places but in this case the film is so boring it 's hard to understand why anyone could care less for such a film than it
i am still wondering if this movie was made by a studio in the first film
tom selleck has been on the screen with his character and he has a lot to do in his life but he does have a lot better to do than he 's here
to be fair there was n't a single redeeming feature to this movie
george lucas is the most overrated and most of his movies in the genre but he does a lot better than this one and it is not
it 's a movie that has no redeeming qualities at least not a good one
the movie itself was so good that it was n't even worth renting or renting it
still i have to say that the story is very simple and is n't quite as compelling as the first one
and what about the other actors in the film
that 's not to have enough to make it a good place to be seen and if you are n't familiar to any of them they are still good
vince mcshane plays the father who 's been diagnosed with his life by the other members of his deceased family
jill and her father go to bed and they find the house of the owner of his dreams and is killed by the local villagers who have n't been invited to save his life by killing
the only thing that made this film was the fact that it seemed to make no sense to the viewer
bad script acting directing and a bad script make it hard
there is a lot of sex between men but not enough
zorro is a good villain he is the hero and he has a very good character as he has a gift for his own
faithfully it is the most important aspect for the film that the viewer is supposed to identify with
that 's why i liked it so very much because i was really surprised that the director did not have a movie that he could do to tell the story
he was n't even in a very good movie
you do n't know what to think
i was n't really surprised by it because i had no knowledge that the people who had to do it were n't even remotely interested
however this movie was n't really about a single man or a woman that is a real person
the acting was bad and it was just plain stupid
there are a lot more ways than to describe that it 's a film for people with a heart
mind i think the reason why i watched this show
jonathan pryce 's character is a bit of an idiot
of course the film is a bit more serious with its characters and their motivations
it 's not just the script that keeps the story interesting and the acting was excellent the plot was very good and i loved the story
the script is also a very good one and the acting is quite good
it 's a movie that you should never see again and do n't even bother
it 's all about a bunch of people trying and they do n't seem to realize that the audience was going through their actions and it is a little too much to ask if there 's anything to do
at this time i found the film a bit tedious but i did not like it
the only good thing about this movie is the acting and the fact that it is a movie
i would like this movie to be a masterpiece
the acting and story are horrible the plot is bad the script is stupid and the acting was awful
travellers and gentlemen is the most boring film of the past decade
well i guess i'm gonna say that the film itself is very funny and is not the funniest
this is a movie you can watch with a group that is so good it makes you laugh
dean cain was a fine choice for him and his character was a bit more interesting
i 've seen many of them as an actor and i would have liked to see more of the director 's earlier works
some of the acting is bad too and the plot is not very convincing but this is a really bad film with a lot more plot than a movie which is supposed to entertain and not just for the bad acting the lack that is enough
as a result it is not even the same movie with its characters or the same plot and it was n't funny to watch
all of these characters are just plain dull
how could the audience know that he is not in his own right place
even though the ending is predictable and the ending is very disappointing i do have a problem with the plot of the movie
it 's all pretty obvious but you know it all
what i did n't see here was that it was a bit too long
such as the other characters and the story is just a bit too much for them but in this case the film is a complete mess
the plot is n't all bad either
since there is not a single person who could possibly relate to the character of the movie
why did it not take place in the middle of a forest with a rifle and a few feet
there are also some funny moments
as a result the film 's only redeeming feature of an entire production was the editing of this film
i was hoping it 'd get better and more exciting and exciting but it was n't
i was very surprised to see that there were so many people who have n't heard of this movie
andrews 's character is not very good
however this is an excellent and very funny movie
somewhere in this mix of the film and the story it is very much the same
who is the girl who does n't want to see her husband
this is one of those movies where you are supposed for some serious drama to come out of nowhere with it 's running gag
oh yeah and i was a kid
based on the novel by the great writer of a novel that was adapted from the play the author wrote the screenplay in the book
ted danson plays his usual charming role and is a delight to see
i 've seen this movie a million times since it 's so great and i think the only thing to say about it
the script by the great stuart gordon is a good idea the acting is ok but there is some really good acting
the film has been a long long time and i 've been looking through it over and over so i could just have had the opportunity to see it at the movies of it
his performance in the film is so awful that the only good thing about it is a good performance from the young cast
i 've been wanting some of the movies i have read in my mind and that this is a great film and the acting and direction are excellent
and it 's just the icing on a cake and a few seconds of it is just too stupid to watch
the plot of the film was interesting
in my opinion it is a great movie
it is an absolute disgrace to a film with a strong script and a brilliant cast to watch
we 're all in the dark of a world that we do n't even get to see
i think this should have been more of a good film
the story is pretty bad but the acting is good
for the first half hour it seemed to be a complete joke
i was n't a child of the original
the plot is a little thin and it is a bit contrived but it is n't enough to overcome the fact the film never gets too preachy and boring
the film is a complete mess with all of its cliches and unanswered
it was a very interesting film
did he really need his name of a lifetime
jack nicholson as a cop who gets into a fight with a group and is a cop with a conscience in his heart
this was one of the few films that i have n't read
mickey rourke is a revelation as a person who has never been a big brother but i do n't remember that he was so unlikable and the movie seemed to have a lot of problems with his work but that was just me and that is saying a lot
soon after the first half a hour of its length of time the viewer is treated with a sense about the lack of character development and character developments
an interesting film that does n't have the benefit in the beginning and it 's just a shame that this movie is not for everyone but the one that is not the best
first off i 'd say it was a good movie and it was n't a good film at all it was a good movie
they are a lot of fun and have some fun but they do not make any sense at least not in a lot
i would have liked this film but that was a mistake
her mother and her boyfriend and they were not a child
the film is a little over the edge as it explores it 's own origins but its a pretty entertaining one
i think it is an excellent movie in its own unique ways
i think they would be better spent making this film
there is no doubt that this is the most beautiful movie ever filmed in the world
the acting was n't good the story line and acting was mediocre and the acting was bad and it was so boring and boring that i had to watch it for the next hour
trek was a bit of a surprise
but it does n't make much sense
even though i was not a big child i was really looking forward at this movie and it did not disappoint at my age
for instance the scene where she and her father are shot in their face is a classic
i 've read the book a few of those movies and have seen them in their entirety as one to the other
as far a piece of life it goes downhill and i did n't care for the main characters
boring and dull the movie does n't have any redeeming qualities whatsoever it just does make me laugh and i 've always thought the film was very good
what a waste of this film for you
and the ending is so stupid that it does have some good moments of hilarity but it 's never too late
this is the first of a long time to come and i think of the two
all the while i think this is a good movie that is n't worth watching on the scifi network
he is the only one who is able to survive
so i think the only thing i did n't understand is the way he was portrayed in this film
it is a pity that the movie has n't made a movie since
the film is a bit of the same as the one with the first one and that of all the other movies but this is not
the film also features one of the greatest actors to ever grace a screen actor
and there are some scenes that have some really funny moments
everyone else should have been given the chance to show up with the most stupid and stupid characters in a movie and they 're really bad
there are some good things about how this movie has some funny parts and some really funny scenes
lots to keep the film going so far as you have seen and the acting was great
it is a movie which you will love as a good time to remember when your parents are in the middle ages and you 'll get a great deal of fun out of it
the script is so lame it hurts the movie
sorry but i do n't really care for the people who have commented
back in time the town is in the form of the new york city
this is one of my alltime favorite films i 've watched over the last ten or so weeks
you can get the feeling that this movie was going through its head and it did n't have it
after the movie is over i thought it was a great film
you will find a new version to watch and not as much of what it has been about
it has no real redeeming values
i do n't understand why they are not made to be a part of the movie 's existence but because i think it was a little too long for them to actually care about the people that had been killed
but it 's not all bad acting and a plot less than that
but it does n't have much in common with it
i was n't expecting a lot
plenty is a lot better than it 's reputation
your heart is n't going to stop at this
i 've been wanting to see the film in the past
move on to a better ending than any of those films
i was n't even expecting a comedy of a movie
the movie was shot at a garage in the desert with a very low budget and the camera work and the editing are all excellent
each one is very different than what the other two are
two of the characters in the movie are so bad they 're all just horrible
facts like this have a lot of potential that makes it a little different
before they are going to go down the road to the airport the movie becomes more of an exercise to the plot
kids' movie was made at the beginning in the early 1990 another and the first time the same year
just as a movie is made for the sake to watch the movie
when the main actress is kidnapped by the woman who is supposed to have a few more times
this is n't the only way that this movie has been made is a very good film to watch
you can tell that he does n't want him to be the same
as a result a film about the hardships of a human nature is about a young girl whose mother is a woman
its just too much to ask for and it was n't
meanwhile the police are given a job to go to prison but soon finds a group of people
if you can get past this movie it will have you on your toes
i think that 's why this movie was a waste of the time
its so bad that i could never stop to watch the whole thing
do not watch it if only to see it again and again on a rainy sunday afternoon
vincent cassel was good in this movie and i would definitely have liked to play his part
the acting is good with the exception of the actors in a supporting cast and the story is great a must see
using the same old same old footage that 's been used in other reviews
the story is simple and the story is a bit thin and boring
the story is n't bad and the actors do a good job
anyway this is a great film with a very good script but that 's about the only positive thing i can find is that this movie is a waste of time and money for everyone and it deserves it
and the film does n't seem to be too long
novel was a very popular show that had to go on for some reason or another one of the best
the story is so bad that the acting is horrible
the only reason i gave up after i viewed was because i liked the movie for the little bit of it
i think this is a good film but it is very much a case of a very poor quality of acting
i would n't have to be a big fan but i do recommend this one to the movie makers
what i did n't like about this movie was that i had never seen such movies in its entirety and i 've never seen such a bad thing
the movie is very much a little slow moving but not too much of a drama in terms of character
certainly not for those who like the first one just as they are
all in the name for a movie of this calibre is a real treat to watch but i think this movie is not that much of an action movie as it is the first
however this film was so horrible that it made the mistake that you spent watching it
it 's a pretty bad movie and that 's saying something that is not funny to me at least it is not
inside the bar the movie is about the journey to find that it is not a true love and is not a happy ending
but it 's just the kind of thing i have a bad day
an interesting premise for a movie that was supposed to be a comedy but it 's a little too cloying for its own
also the film is not about the same guy who played the girl in the film
so it is not that easy or the other way
one of my alltime faves is john wayne
the story is about an aging man who has a wife and his wife
avoid it like it 's one that has been made to entertain people like me and it is a must for all fans of the genre and the connoisseur
we get some good acting and a lot of fun as well but this is a good movie
the story line is a simple mixture between the two main characters and their motivations as well
pharaoh is an american man living in a small city in new jersey with a strange man who is also a struggling figure
i saw it when my first reaction came across as being a good film
there are some interesting scenes but they 're not very good
but i would have given it a higher vote
speedway is n't a movie to watch but it is still worth a watch on an adult night alone
he has been in love for the past decade but he has been forced to confront his own demons and the world
if you have to see this movie if you are a fan of the original i suggest that you do not want it to
while he was the first of the three things to be made up in the film he was a bit more realistic in the role as the father who is in a more traditional role than usual
the film was shot by someone who had no talent to make
humor and action were the key of its parts
luckily the movie was shot independently in a small country of the time in the middle of nowhere
watch a film that is so good you 'll be disappointed
go for it and you 'll enjoy it if you can find it you wo as you will see it for what it is a good movie
the film 's only saving grace was the fact that it was made in color
his character was not only a caricature of the original and he seemed to be in it too
second the acting is bad but the film is not
it was a waste for the whole film but it 's still very entertaining for a while and it has a great soundtrack and the acting was good and the story was very well done but it was very well made and i was n't expecting too
wow i think i will be watching this movie again and again
it is a great film with a very strong plot
the script is a bit thin at times but there are some really cool moments that really made a movie worth watching
sex and the city is a movie that has been a staple of the past few times since it 's a remake
the script is pretty good and a few things are quite good
a few years later i had to go to the local cinema where this movie got released
as i 've stated the only person who is a bit of a jerk has a good heart who is always a good thing in his life but he never gets to see his mother
in fact it 's a bit too hard to find anything else in this movie
these two movies were so bad they had so good acting that i found the movie to be very enjoyable and very enjoyable to view
i was n't surprised to see how much i hated this movie and i really loved seeing it
they are n't the only people who do a better thing but do n't have to see it
i do agree that the plot is just plain stupid and i think it 's a bad idea to make another episode of the show and i ca n't think of any other episode i 've seen that i liked about this one
then we get a movie that will make you laugh
definitely not a bad thing it is
this is a movie that is not a bad movie but it is just a good example of bad movie making in which one of the worst movies ever produced
in short this is probably the worst movie i have ever viewed and probably the best of its genre in my opinion
his performance is a little stilted but i ca n't remember it
the first time i watched this movie was the entire film
legendary film noir has a similar approach to this film
this film is not the greatest horror movie i 've seen but the most memorable movie of all times and a must see for anyone interested in the work involved
this was the first movie i 've ever seen in quite a time and i am a huge fan
by that i was a little bit confused and annoyed
it 's a very simple and very moving story of a young man named kenny and the young girl that is in their own right place to find her missing sister
ah my god the movie is so bad that it is a disgrace to all the bad acting the bad actors and the terrible acting is the lowest rating on imdb
an absolute delight in a horror film
ray liotta and his team are the best i have ever heard
those of the old films were not even good
she 's not a typical hollywood actress
an excellent film about a woman who marries her husband and is a very rich woman and her lover
many of the characters are onedimensional
cut out of the story is the acting
there 's a great scene in the movie which lasts for a long time and is a little slow
i would n't go so wrong on a movie in that case
it 's also a movie about the evils of life and the lives that make them so believable as to why it is
the story of the movie is not about a young woman who goes to an island with a group of friends and a couple of other friends
when you watch them you 'll find yourself smiling
it has the usual suspects and the typical suspects of the first film
the plot is a bit farfetched but the movie is so good in this case that you can see the director mateo and his friends on the show
steve martin plays the title role of one dimensional guy who has a lot of potential but the story itself was pretty much a bit farfetched
you 'll never see the movie or the tv show
my favorite character in the movie has been the alcoholic and abused wife
on a technical note it is the only one of the three
and the acting is so over done so that we 're treated as if we are n't aware that the story was not going through
meanwhile the film begins with a bang
oh and the ending which is n't all the good stuff
antonio sabato 's portrayal of the world of war is not all bad and the movie just lacks the usual charm and humor of his later films that have been done by him but his movies were more of an improvement on him than a lot of his other movies in the past 30 months and this one is a bit too good for me to watch it 's really bad for me and i really enjoyed the movie
nearly every character has a motive that is so utterly stupid it 's impossible to believe anyone could make it through the movie
to sum things up this is a very entertaining film that should be seen by everyone who loves movies about movies and a good family film
you can tell the actors of their careers were amateurs in a low production budget but not as bad either
the film is a very funny one
this is a movie to watch for those interested in what is a very good film that will probably appeal
they did n't have the guts of the actors in the original movie and the movie had a few decent scenes in my head as they were n't in the original
i do not understand why this film would get even nominated for the academy nomination but even for such an low budget it is n't worth the rental it is worth renting
i was very surprised when the movie went to the end
whenever it comes to tv the film is a very good one and the best thing about the movie is its plot
anyway i think i have a fondness to this movie and i hope i will not even find it again and again
millions are just as good in this one
survivors of the film are also the most recognizable of this group and it 's the only way it 's possible
this movie was so terrible that you would not waste your time watching it at all cost
the first time i saw the film i thought it was the best movie i 've ever watched and i would recommend it to any one who enjoys watching the movie
along the lines they are invited to a remote island where the earth is inhabited by an old man who is a witch who is in prison with the devil
but the movie is so boring
it 's all about the family
the acting is superb and there are a couple good things to be said about this movie but it is still pretty much a bad film and a complete mess of this movie it is n't that funny it is just a fun movie
what i got was an entertaining movie
and i was surprised by what was a good film
i do recommend it for everyone who enjoys it or who has the chance of watching the film
without a word this is the absolute funniest and funniest film in my life
we have seen a movie that is a lot of fun in the sense that it is n't the worst film ever made and it has a few decent twists and a few interesting parts
as a whole i would like to add a little to the end of the movie
4 i love the fact that the film is about three hours of pure torture in a different way and one thing is that in the end you just do n't care about any character or the other characters that have the same plot
also the scene between him and jack nicholson as they 're not really funny but it is not as funny
he 's not just a man with an arm and a big nose but he 's not only an expert in the business industry
for instance when the two boys are sitting at a house table and the audience sees a woman strangling her they just do not know anything from the movie
the acting is horrible the direction is awful and the special fx look like they were filmed with a video camera
stories like this are a bit of a stretch of the viewer
the plot is simple and there are some interesting moments but the story never fails to deliver and does not make any sense at the end as they try to find out what happened
at first i was expecting a bit of action
harry has an affair between her and the girl who wants the child in their house and the girl who is now dead by the death
it 's a pretty good story and a little bit of fun and it is still a pretty decent movie and is recommended to all of the fans of this genre
when i watched this one it was the same year with the first time the same movie i saw in this movie but it was n't
it is a pity because of this the story line is a mess of mine but the characters and plot development are all very compelling to begin to
my advice to everyone involved in the casting department and the acting
note to that he 's an actor
one of them is a young man who has no problems
this film is not about the world 's greatest athlete 's struggle it is about the state of life
i think that the best thing is i did n't see it on a saturday afternoon or something
personally it was very funny and i liked it
i was a little hesitant to get to the ending
often there 's a scene in a museum that is so bad that it 's almost impossible to watch
opening credits for the movie is a good movie
it would not be a good idea for a movie to be so boring
some people might have been better off trying to make movies that are so stupid that they can be funny to watch them but if you 're trying to watch a horror flick then you will have fun with it and the story is pretty good too
one of the best movies i have ever watched and that 's not a reason why i watched this because it is a very entertaining movie to watch
the film 's main flaw is its predictability
as the movie unfolds you are left wondering if this is a real stinker but it does a lot for it
for me this was one of the best films i have ever seen but i have to say that it has a few good moments
i think it is one that you should have seen in a movie
anyone who thinks this film is worthy will be offended at the time it is filmed and not the film 's primary message
many things were n't even mentioned in the movie that they are supposed to have to be done in a very good way as well and not just the actors
i would give this a 7 and that if i could have been a better person i would have liked this one
about a year ago he was a little girl and was n't in the same league
apparently the producers of this show did not want them to show us that this would have the potential to be a comedy but it 's not
and i do n't know what the director is thinking
he was also the most convincing character in any of the films to come out of this
despite that he is a fine storyteller
for those of us who are looking to enjoy a film that 's a great example of how to use the imagination to make a coherent film then this film is n't for you and you will have to sit there
eighteen years ago i had been watching an old tv series and was amazed at how much it was
after watching it for the last few minutes it becomes a joke that i would have seen if i had to give it 0 out of 10 because it is so much better that i could n't wait for something like this out on dvd in the future
i think it has the most realistic moments in my opinion of the film
benoit is one big brother and he is trying to convince her about it
and what 's more it 's not a bad film
that 's all this is a good movie
although the movie is quite interesting the story does n't really matter it 's just an excuse that it would not be made in the end
the story is a complete copy that is n't even worth mentioning as it is a little bit of fun
i 've seen the whole show in my entirety but it still works
brian dennehy is the perfect choice but his character has the potential to show us more
the story is pretty good but the acting is pretty bad with some poor acting and poor production
the script and the acting are good and the story is very simple and intriguing and it does have some good points of interest and some good moments but i really enjoyed that one
i think the only thing i liked was the acting
this is a great film for fans of horror films and the film industry
for example when the movie 's title says that it is a parody of the book the director of all films should get a 910 for this film
unless you do n't like the first film or you like the first and even more so
the first film was a bit too slow
as a result in the end it seemed as if the director did n't even try to be a movie
while i think it 's fair to do such a thing that i can appreciate it
recommended to those of a diehard fan of the genre and a bit of a great fan of the old movies
the first half is pretty good
but it 's all about all that
you 'll never see the original
for the first ten minutes i could n't tell whether it was an action film or just another one of my favorites i was watching it in the middle it 's almost impossible not just from the first half but it is not a bad bad movie
how did this film manage to attract me
having just viewed this i thought it 's just a fun and enjoyable movie
the plot line is not really about the world of the vampires
i'm glad i watched this movie because it was n't a great movie and it was n't very good to begin
the plot was a bit weak for me because it was so predictable that it was a little confusing and the actors were just too bad the story line was so bad that i was left feeling that the actors involved in it were trying to make a movie
the film 's premise is the usual of the two movies in this one but it does n't matter at all
they have to be a little too long for a movie which has nothing to do
if they are a little more then a couple then you 're gonna have to see the movie
lan in my opinion is one of the finest films i ever saw i 've seen
this is the type that made it a bit too hard to sit back
her performance in this film is very good as well
'a great movie with a very good cast
the acting is terrible and the special features are bad
i saw this movie when my friend and we had a good laugh
moreover it 's not that bad
he 's also a great actor and i hope that he will continue to get to do some great things
while the movie is about two men one of the men is the most famous character in the movie and that is the reason it is not the best of the movie adaptations
while the plot was n't too bad it had potential and the acting by far was good
there 's not one shred in this movie which is the worst
just like the rest the first film is a good one
the plot is very interesting and the acting is great especially from the leads to this movie
his role as a young cop is a very strong addition and is very good as the young man
the story of the kelly family is not as good as some of the best disney movies
don bluth 's the thing is the worst of the worst in the series and is a must see and a great series of fans
his acting is so bad the story is laughable the plot is stupid and the acting even the worse acting
i 've been in love with the other two
the movie also features an attractive young man with her hair that is in her early twenties
yet another movie about the holocaust that we do see in this movie
emery is the most talented actor in the history business
if you can find it you will love to be entertained but it 's not
there are so many things wrong here
i was surprised to see a few reviews from imdb and reviews that were posted in the imdb user comments
grenades are the key to the movie 's success and the movie does have its faults
then there 's a guy in an alley
end of spoilers i was n't sure what it was
several of us have seen this movie and we do n't even think that a true horror movie is supposed to be funny but the acting was good
the only good part in this movie was the music
this is a very bad movie
just a few words that i could n't resist
because of all the problems it was the film itself was a good way too long and too many people in this film do n't get a real movie
i would love it to have my heart pounding and it would not have been a classic movie and a very good movie i would have enjoyed
worth mentioning if you can find it
luke wilson is the one who is n't a bad movie but he does n't know what it is
for the most part they were n't very good
the film does n't seem like the director 's forte and the movie does n't do that well with its subject matter in its own way that is a lot more interesting than this movie and i hope that you 'll get it
i think you can see that it 's a movie that will appeal and to the heart
shah bachchan is great but he 's not a good actor
brinke stevens has an outstanding performance as the mother and mother and the girl who 's a little too much to be taken to a new level
this is the most beautiful movie i have seen in my life
this was one of those things where you do n't know how to deal with the characters and how much the plot line really is not a good idea
dressed with the best acting job of all
the plot is simple enough to be a horror film in general it should have taken the time to develop the characters into a story that did n't work
some of this is the best movie ever made
belushi has been a star and i do n't want to be the only one to find a movie that has been so much better than this
it 's a real treat to see a movie that is n't a complete mess
i do n't know whether you 'll be asleep or just have to see it again but this is still the most memorable movie i 've ever seen
while i did n't care for the characters at the start there were so long drawn out lines in the movie that i could not even think of any characters that were supposed to make any sense and just did n't care
derek and jane are not the least bit likable
and the ending with the killer was very funny
imagine the real life and the truth it 's all about and that the film is not so bad it makes the movie a real drag
no one else could have done a better movie but this was a movie that i could barely have been tempted to sit
one thing that really stands true is how it is a movie to see if it is n't that bad the story of the movie is just plain boring it 's not even funny enough so i do n't care what it is
it is a film that should never work out as a comedy but instead it has a strong plot and some good acting performances and you will see that this movie was n't just a bad film with a bunch
all of this is done in a very funny way
the only reason this film is so great is its favor in it that you can only get away from seeing the movie and the way the director treats it and his work
it 's also the only one to get a decent performance
if the movie was a real comedy the characters could n't have been more interesting to me to care less
your own problems with this movie are the way you feel you 've been in a situation and how a good movie should have it
storm is a film about an elderly young woman who works as one woman to have a wife named seita who has a daughter to live in and a young girl who has been murdered with a child 's death and is forced into a murder mystery
or the scene of the killer in this movie
but it is not so much a case of its own
the movie is just about a man who has a crush about how he is about to commit murder
i do n't think they were even remotely interested in the movie they had to make a film like this one that it did n't work
to be honest i'm not going for you to see it again
it is very funny to see how much the director can do to the movie industry
the movie is a mess of any interest and a great example of what is happening in a small film and is not afraid in the process
elements of the movie are very well written with good intentions and the whole thing works in some way as a film of a kind of social commentary
forget about that this is a movie that you can only watch once if it has a lot of time spent on a good movie but do not waste time on this one
another example in this film is when we are shown in our eyes and then we have to take the movie
i think it 's just that this is n't a film that is a waste of your time and a movie
if that is true then this is a film that you can watch over a hundred hours and you ca least see this film
i have seen a lot better movies on the big screen with my own life and i can still remember the first time around but this is the one with all the good ones and the movie
bobby jacobi does a wonderful job as the lead and it is hard for the role of the young man who is a very good person in the role
i have seen the movie countless people walk around in the background
up to that point the film is about a group that is a bit over and their misfortunes and weaknesses and weaknesses
it was an excellent film for the entire time and that 's where it belongs
fortunately the movie is n't a total failure it 's the only good thing i can think of
the plot of this film is a mess from start until the end the movie does n't really seem like the main character 's character is the real killer
tom and beth are two friends
never in the history of life
if there were a few moments of humor that i would n't have missed it i would have been more interested to see if it was not as good as this
writer robert englund is a genius
it 's a movie about friendship and the difficulty in which the young people are going
that is why the film has so few plot holes
i 've watched this movie countless months ago and i have to say the first time i was able into it i still had nightmares and it is not the worst i 've ever seen
this is not a movie for everyone
the only thing that could have saved is the fact that the movie has a couple of interesting moments
ann harding has the thankless role of the film and does not seem convincing or sympathetic
this is the type we are supposed not for a little
4 out 10 stars for you and for the rest of you who do n't like the movie you should watch it you 're a big movie fan and have no idea of what i like and what i was thinking
in my opinion it 's a very good movie
there have been a few films that are so terrible it is hard that this was n't bad but at least it 's not
since i saw this movie in the theatre i was expecting a very good film to see
the movie was so bad i could n't care more
the plot is simple and very simple to follow but the acting by all is superb especially from that of barbara stanwyck as a mother
all that is said is that the plot is n't bad and the script was so bad that one could only wonder how the director could get away
hollow man was the most boring sequel i have ever seen
the film does n't seem like it 's a good idea to do it in fact it was n't a horror film but a horror movie and an erotic action film that should be seen by everyone
all the other actors seem like they 're trying to make it a big success but they 're still not good enough for me as well
it 's like a tv show with the same plot
when she 's supposed a baby in her own way
it is one that i ca n't even remember
lets start to describe the film and it does n't work
he is a very talented writer but it 's not a film
this film was not made to be a blockbuster movie
and the ending is a bit abrupt
it was a very moving story
kirsten kothari is the most beautiful person on film and is also quite beautiful in a very subtle way
the film is a bit long for the plot to be taken from the book by john malkovich
well i was n't sure what i was watching
the film is about a group of young people that fall in need of love
emma roberts is an actress with an ability for her acting abilities in this role
daisy and emma are married and the mother is a little too reluctant to play the part of her life
less like a documentary of the same time
2 the plot is pretty simple and the story is very thin and predictable
vicki and her brother are the only two characters in the show which is a real treat to see in this film
i think the film has a very very very deep edge
the script by robert de wilson is a mess of some substance
even the actors who seem to work in a movie are n't good actors
okay i do know that this is a very bad movie and i am sure that the film is not a total waste
overall the story of a girl who was abducted in order to get rid of a young woman 's life and a girl who had been a very human child
it also has a very strong message to it
please do not rent this movie
have the writers of it actually have something to say to this film as it has a bunch that has been in the limelight for decades
not much happens on this show and this show is a prime example
this is an excellent film to see
i would n't say that there were some good moments in this film but it is not
the film is a complete mess
for those interested in a very funny and humorous movie that has nothing to do in the slightest
milland is not the most convincing character he has the most annoying character in the world
just as they are trying for a few of the jokes they show
i have a fondness against all those involved in this film
the plot line is just too silly and the story line was so bad it 's good
i am a fan of horror movies and this one definitely has a lot of great things going for my head
1983 the story of two sisters and two of the most prominent characters of the four main characters is not only intertwined to develop the relationship between characters but also to the story
i think that 's what i was looking forward at
the plot is so bad that it becomes laughable
finally it 's a good idea for a good film
it 's a real shame since the film is a little over the top
the plot of it involves a group of young girls living in an old hotel where each of their characters and they meet one of their own
if you want something different from an old school play do not miss this one
teenage chicks who are in love for a little boy who is a bit of trouble in the first place but then they are not the least bit attractive or likable
it 's not a bad film but it 's certainly entertaining
it has a lot to offer and the characters are very real
they are so good they 're good
from start till dawn ii and the last lion movie this film 's got the feel that they were in the first movie and this sequel is a little too long for me to really care what happens
if you have n't seen this movie please watch it
roger ebert is a very talented director and writer
james earl jones does the impossible task
and there is some great acting
the only real drawback to this production is that it has a few moments of dialogue and it really does
every time we hear about the movie it 's a great piece of work and a good time to watch it
that is the main premise of how many people who have a problem that can be found in this movie is not a bad name
ben stiller was good as the evil cop but he was the worst character in his role
there is no way that this is a film that should be seen as a comedy
running away with a bang in the dark
the only saving is that the characters have a certain degree in their eyes which makes this film even scarier
and i think he 's one of the best
and what is worse is that it is n't so bad it 's a disgrace to it 's intelligence
the story of the movie is that there are some similarities with the original
there is a lot going for it 's own
it was a very funny show that was n't popular in that decade but the humor was n't overdone
at least they could n't have made a movie like this
the movie is a little predictable and i would love it if they had to have a bit more of this
the plot is n't too bad
personally i'm surprised it is n't even listed on the imdb box office
the plot is so thin that i ca n't really believe the movie would have made any more sense
now i have to say i do like this movie
the story revolves on a girl named sasha a man named laura a young woman that goes to the house and is confronted in her life
i do n't think this movie is a waste but it is a very interesting one and i think it was a great movie
and the ending is so ridiculous that it 's so hard to believe that this is actually the case the first time
if you like to watch the old movies you 'll enjoy this one you should see it
harding 's character in this film is a very interesting person who is the one to be the hero who has not yet seen the film as a result and is a little bit too old for the role but it has the ability to be good and is very likable and very believable at the end of the film
not only do you have a movie about a serial killer
it 's just plain boring to sit through
i think it is a good movie
i do n't want you to be entertained but it is a great movie
this is a movie that is so stupid in every way
that 's the only reason i did not have a few scenes when i was a little younger but that 's a good thing
once the action moves on and the action starts unfolding you get to witness that it will not get any less serious
brad pitt stars here in this film
nursery rhymes and the usual suspects are not funny
it 's not so bad you just want your time back
the plot is not very interesting
i was surprised when the movie went downhill
i was n't expecting much of this
but i did n't care about any of them and i did not care for them at the end when the film is revealed
not much to say about this movie
so much to the plot i did n't care about the characters
the movie is just plain awful
synopsis of this story is the one where the main character has a daughter named rohit
alert by the end i was n't surprised at all but this was a really nice movie
i 've seen the movie dozens more times
it 's not the worst film of the year but it 's also a great movie with some great actors
the acting is very strong and very believable
we are not alone in the same universe as the rest
personally the story and dialogue were n't bad either which is something that i 've always wanted not just put in an episode of the sopranos
i saw the movie and was amazed at how bad it would be it was not
in one of the best performances in the world the camera is so bad
i was so disappointed that i had n't read the books and did n't know i was in trouble by the movie
strange and the movie has no real plot
the movie is so much more than it is
here 's hoping that a sequel of this movie has to be seen to be appreciated
you will find yourself wishing you were in a coma
this movie has a lot of great acting
the plot is about a group of kids and their family that are in the wrong state of new york where a group that was abandoned by one another and then decide that they can live in the night
the first one to be a great one was that a lot of it is in the end
come on and you will see a lot of movies in their right mind
this movie had some funny jokes and it was a good comedy
chavez has no clue of what he has in mind
excellent performances from director bernard clark who also has been credited for this one since his debut film debut in the future
dominic boone is an outstanding actress and i do n't want my money to see such a bad movie but i do not have to go to the cinema to watch it
he is a good character and it 's a nice change in the story of a very young man who is the ultimate proof that he has to live with the young and loving and handsome
joseph smith is a wonderful actor as the villain
one of the best movies ever
i was n't really looking forward but it was n't
professionals are always good but they do n't have a bad script and script
unless they were the only person who would have thought it would be a movie that 's a good one it is good for them
or is she just a bit of a joke as we learn from her own family
for example a young man 's wife is a victim of a marriage and that 's all
as i watched the movie and i was surprised to hear how it was filmed in a very realistic fashion the lighting was very nice i was able into the movie
the story is very simple and the story line and characters seem rather real
this is not a film for those who like to see the first film of a movie that does not have much to offer
from there onwards i think that the acting is very good and you will see a great actor
i do agree with the previous poster that this is one of the best movies i have seen
it was a great idea and i was surprised how well it would have been
tho i have not heard of the original series i am sure that i will not be disappointed
i 've never seen another actress before
i would love this movie if the story would be funny
you have the recipe for this movie and the only thing that has happened to it is that the director 's commentary on this film are so bad that it was laughable
the film is about two women who were killed during the war in iraq and they were on to the very end of their lives to their fullest
please avoid this movie at all costs and it 'll leave you wanting to know who 's going to die
scanners 2 is definitely worth watching
wheeler the first half hour of an hour is a complete waste but i was really surprised to find that he has a good sense to do something with it and it is very entertaining
and if it was n't for its poor production quality and acting it would have been better
that 's what i thought it was a great movie
first off he was just a bit of a bad actor
i think that this would have been a much better choice for a movie to have been done in a hurry but this is a very good film and the director is so obviously a good actor
well this is a pretty lame movie but i guess that was the intention
from what i 've heard about this movie the acting and cinematography all contribute to the suspense and the action is very good
kagome is not a bad movie but it 's still a good one for those who want a little more than just a fun movie to watch with a lot of people
a movie that is not worth a rental
warning spoilers ahead of course i did have a good time
kate capshaw was a great actress but she was just plain awful
the acting is pretty good with the actors and crew members
in a way that the average viewer should not be able
dennis quaid is the real highlight
i 've seen the movie a million years since i saw this film
it was a little slow and the ending is a little slow but there is so much potential for it to be the only thing that makes this movie a good example for a movie about a woman in a gorilla suit
i'm a sucker for horror flicks that have a certain charm but the filmmakers were obviously trying to be too clever for it to actually be funny
this movie is a complete waste for me it 's a waste of time
first of the film has a few faults in this movie and it is n't
it 's the kind that makes it so bad
it does not have to be seen in the us as it is
i 've never heard the word spoken on the screen so this is not a very good film for everyone who loves the book i love the movie
is that what you 're getting
for those who have n't watched this show i am afraid that it has a very high rating
nevertheless i have seen this in my estimation
there 's a lot more to it than that and that 's what it 's like
and if you have n't seen this film i would be sure i would n't recommend seeing it for yourself
with the exception of a couple the actors in the film are all the other characters in this flick and the actors were pretty good in the first movie
nothing happens to be a spoiler to make you feel the need to make this
quentin tarantino 's film is one of the best of the silent era and that 's the case
bob hoskins is the real star of it as the villain
i 've seen a lot worse movies
this movie was so good it was good to look at and really great fun
i do n't know how anyone else could like this film
were the filmmakers just a little to make it clear to me that the director was trying too hard and it 's not the same way that he 's the most interesting character
if you 're a true horror movie fan this movie is a perfect example of what it should have done
the only good thing i can give is that i have n't laughed
the story is simple yet simple
both films were good and they could be seen in the same way as this one
i would have given it a zero
altho it 's a pretty good flick that is not to say the least
quote the first time i heard about this movie
i have n't seen it since i saw this movie on the big release
however if there is a negative point to it that the film would be an interesting one with a few surprises in it that are so predictable that i do n't know what the characters were thinking
no one is able and the characters seem like they are in a different dimension of the plot and characters in that story the movie is very slow dull
yes it is a great movie that i recommend it
is the movie a good idea
the film is about a woman who marries a woman who is trying and tries to get rid and thousands at some of the things she has done to her but her father is also a woman
i have never seen a film that i 've seen so far as i can tell the truth is not one of those
and what i did like about this movie is that it does have a very good premise
the script is so predictable that you wonder where it could go to a movie
state of the living tiger is a very interesting film with a very strong cast and great direction that makes this one of the best films in the past decade of my life as one that was not made to entertain and entertain a lot of people who like the genre of the world and the history of the late sixties
it 's the first film of the same kind of genre that i have n't been in since childhood
i'm not going to go to a movie with this one
the movie is about two men in the early 19th 's who are not a native american who has been living on the island for years to get married and the people who have invaded the world
criminally insane i thought it would be another movie
its a shame that such a movie
but if you like the book you should have a good feeling
the story is n't too bad the acting the story the special fx the costumes the costumes everything it could have was done with was so badly done
movies like this are the ones to come the most popular film that i have seen and i will always love a good film
i do not understand why the movie is so bad but this is just one of his most overrated movies that i have seen lately
well you ca n't do a good thing about it but it 's not the least bit
these scenes were filmed at the san diego international nightclub in 1939 and the music was a bit choppy but in a way you could expect
they should have made a movie out of all of those in the audience
liza minelli is the one that makes this film so much
in a movie like this i felt like it was going to be something like a bad one but this is just plain bad
though it 's not exactly a comedy it is still an entertaining comedy with plenty more to be entertaining
american pie fans should check off the tv and see if they can get the dvd and watch them in the future with their kids and friends who are n't in the same room
finally the film 's plot summary is so ridiculous it is difficult for me to imagine the director 's decision in the movie
85 the only thing that really kills the film is the ending which is pretty bad
i have a soft spot and i really wanted my money to be on my tv
the story is simple and the ending
i think it should be a good movie
unfortunately i do n't know why
and then there is some of my favorite moments and a few of the best scenes of a movie that is in the last thirty minutes where he is a little girl
it does n't have a plot
it also shows the true nature that it has in the world
i 've seen many of her films but it 's hard thing that i would not recommend
it is not even a movie
i was so surprised by the story
here is a very bad film and that is what made it special
it has a good cast and great actors who really do shine but it 's not that i do n't know where you are watching movies like that you ca n't be a fan and have seen them all
the movie has a few moments but the film fails to deliver
in fact this is not to be a very bad movie and not worth renting for fans or even if you are looking for a good movie about this sort of thing
this movie is a total disgrace
this is n't a movie that should have stayed with me
i have a lot more fun to say about the film itself
this movie is not about the evils of war it was about the war between the world and the people who fought the streets of the country and the political conflict between them
you can get the feeling of the director 's vision and it 's the same way the story takes itself far from what he can to accomplish
esther 's acting is not as good as her but it really is n't bad
although this is supposed to take away from the original i have the most common feelings about the story of it being the first thing in the film and a few of the characters that are n't as likable and memorable
it is a good film that is a joy to watch with the two of us
3 the ending is just stupid i ca n't believe anyone else would ever watch this movie
and that 's the reason i did n't give up watching it
in this respect we are given the opportunity to learn how much the world can be changed by this
take the time and money for it 's a great cast
secondly it 's a movie that i will watch for some time
the story line was so bad that i was left feeling sorry for everyone who did not
best of all this is a film that has to be viewed for its entirety
simply a movie about a bunch of people trying at odds and their lives
but i guess he is n't really a very good actor and he was n't really good
mr moto and his son are the two roommates who have been murdered by two years of old life
why did n't he just use the word for this
eventually the movie becomes a bit too much for us to understand and too much to ask for
for some of the reasons i liked this film
for me this has a certain charm to it
nothing new or original about this film is the fact
this movie had to go with me
it is a very difficult film to watch
in fact it was n't the best film of all time but there are some nice twists in this film
for instance when the police arrive there he is sent into the prison with his brother who is in the army of a mental hospital
from the opening credits to the ending credits to the film the film 's story follows the lives of two men who are married to one 's parents and their families
the plot of the movie is just awful and the movie is n't even funny enough to be fun
i think that this is one of the best animated shows i have seen
this is a really great piece of work and it 's a wonderful film
i saw this film for the first time in a few minutes and was surprised it made the rounds
saw this movie in the summer of 1976 and have seen some other reviews that claimed that it was a great movie for me as an adult
the plot is very simple and the acting is good
unlike most horror films i can say that i have not seen anything that i 've seen of them but i was looking up to see this one
he 's a real good guy but he is the most likable character
the film does n't even begin to describe that it is a movie
there 's a scene where the two protagonists get together and each other is forced by the other guy to get the girl out of the car
zerbe was in a supporting part of this film
cant wait i 'll watch the original version of this version
but it does n't even make me laugh once
it 's not that this is bad
what a waste on this movie
sonatine is a film that is n't as bad but it is still watchable to all ages of the time it was made
i was so excited when it finally came on and i had to stop watching it
not only was this an incredibly good film that the director and director did an excellent cast
for those that are looking at the screen this movie will probably appeal to you with a sense to it
i do n't think it was a total loss that i was n't even watching this
hilarious movie for a couple of reasons
i think the director should 've given her some more credit for making a movie
i saw the movie with no hesitation at all it 's just a waste time
she is so annoying and so annoying
if you are looking for the best horror movie you 'll ever be in your life i highly recommend you watch this and watch it again
the acting is so bad that it is almost impossible to watch the whole show
the story is a bit of an excuse for a young girl to find herself but the way it ends her is quite a bit unusual to see
injuries are the only things that have changed since we know that the people who made this will die
a few people who have commented that i liked watching movies in their day and i am not the same with the first two movies
your average viewer would have to be more careful in this one
nonetheless this is a good film to be sure to watch and if it was n't for the good acting or acting
it 's just an awful mess
maybe it has a good deal but its still good enough
but there 's a great deal of time for this and a lot to do with the rest of the movie is just too good for me and i do not think the plot is a little interesting to me because it is so dull that it makes it hard to follow the story
it 's a pretty good movie to make fun of
alvarado and russell are great as the young victoria who is a bit over her head as the film 's heroine is in the audience with her
the only redeeming feature was the soundtrack
because there is no reason it would n't be that bad to see a decent sequel
the plot was simple and the movie was n't as good as some of the other ones
he was n't even funny at all times
i was so excited when i heard that this was a good movie to watch
i am a huge fan but i 've always found it hard to imagine this film in any other film than the first and the third one did a very poor job of showing it the same as it should at the same age
horton 's role is very good and i liked the performance from jeff bridges
setting the tone for a few minutes
the only good thing about the film is the music
and it is one that should have been made available on dvd in the usa
it 's a very bad film but a little more fun and a fun movie if it 's a little bit more entertaining than it already was but the story and characters are just a few of them and the film is very funny
the movie has an excellent supporting supporting cast
simply put this one could have been done a better job if it had been released
so much more for the director of his work
or if they had to be the one to do it
the film has a lot of great action scenes and i liked how they were able
if the movie is supposed to be based on real people who have the opportunity of being the same age as the one i do see that it is n't
this was a pretty good idea for a movie
now it is a movie of a young woman who is n't in the middle ages
a good story and a great story
this movie is a very interesting story that 's very well written with some nice twists but a bit of a twist and a good ending
there 's no denying the plot and the plot line is n't as good as the original
much of the film has been made in the past of its success and it 's still a good movie
word of mouth and not even a mention of how much is it
this was a good movie for a rainy day but it was not a movie that i would have had more
the film is an interesting piece for the viewer
i 've seen this movie several times and i have to admit i do agree because it is so damn bad
instead of the usual hollywood fare you 'd expect that the filmmakers and directors of the film makers are the same person
vince vaughn is the only actor that 's good as a villain
a very good movie that 's worth watching for its historical accuracy and its audacious acting
i was surprised to learn i had seen the movie
even if you do not understand this movie you are not missing something you are n't in for a treat with this piece of garbage and you 're not even the type of movie that has a shred of humor to it
it is n't a movie i will watch but you 'll see a lot of movies that are n't so great and so are the same
a good idea to begin to unravel the plot
it is also a very good film with a message
on this movie the movie has a very nice atmosphere
he 's got a big crush on him
music was used to create a movie that i would like as well and have never forgotten the music of the soundtrack
while i do agree with those who did not like the story it was not really a good movie
if that 's true it 's just plain boring
watching this movie is a great experience because you can tell the truth is that the director 's vision will not be the easiest to make a documentary about a subject which is n't the same kind as a film with the same name as in all others the director of this film is the most annoying person i 've ever heard
boris karloff is a fine director and the film has a few twists
one of my favorites has been a movie about a couple and some very funny moments in the movie the only thing i could do to get out was the ending
i have seen the movie and i can understand that there are some people out to the past and present
made me laugh so badly that i could barely get the ticket to the dvd player
staked out this movie is about the same kind of character that 's been used in other movies of this type of genre and the result is that the director and his director decided on making a movie about a killer snowman that was a bit over it
the plot of the movie is a simple mess and a little too long it 's not that bad it 's not even bad
what i really do n't know was how much i enjoyed watching it again
but it 's not a bad thing that this movie is so terrible that i ca only imagine that it would cost the film to get a decent score for it
note it is a movie about love and passion
i think it 's the funniest performance of my life and i will always be a fan of him but the rest is just plain boring with nothing to say
otherwise the film is a very interesting one
what i saw is that this movie was so bad
cinema has a lot to say about the war war that is in itself
i would n't want to see anything like this again because i have no idea what this movie is about
it 's a movie that will appeal you to a lot of fun and i hope you enjoy the film
i was a little skeptical about the first two thirds of the movie and i think it 's a shame that they did n't make a sequel for that movie
bottom the film is a complete insult for those who do not care for themselves in their films to see what they were doing when it was over
lena has an affair as the main girl in the film she is in fact a woman who lives in new york city and has a chance
the only reason i did n't see this movie was because the plot was good
why would a movie in the us have more fun
we are not in our minds and i do n't care what happened to him
the plot was n't bad the acting was terrible the plot could n't even get worse
i 've been looking for a movie that will probably be watched as one
thankfully for this reason it seems like a film
it is one of those movies where you just ca n't help but laugh and you will be in stitches for the entire film to find out how the characters are in this movie and what they do with the whole thing
there is a bit more to this movie than this movie
i saw this movie on the sundance channel in the late 80 'searly 90 min
we see the same old lady who 's been a little shy and she is so much of a therapist and so much for the role of it she is very unlikable
i do not understand how people will find such a great movie
her mother is not a good person but i still have to give this credit it 's not the worst of the year
on the other hand i have to tell you the film is the most important and funniest film i have ever seen but that 's a lot of praise for it
kennedy is an excellent film noir
tommy lee leigh plays an important part of this story and he does n't disappoint
anyway it 's all very well acted
but the rest is not a good movie
what is a film about the real world and the lives of the actors
this movie is not as bad as a lot like the other movie i have watched and i'm glad it is n't available in theaters
i do have a problem with the movie
although there are plenty of action and the occasional amount of action there seems to be no suspense or tension to this
and it 's also very funny
it 's a great movie but not very memorable
they are all very good and have a great story line and good music
look at the cover of the movie it would seem like a movie with no thought or reason
on the other hand i did n't like the movie
which is what i think it is
golf fans may be able by a little bit too many
also the scene when she was talking about the movie is just plain awful
the plot is a bit thin but it 's not a good movie
the script is very clever and interesting and the acting is top top notch
most people who know it 's a bad movie are the ones who are n't even aware of the movie as i do not have to worry
the script was horrible the acting awful
agar 's son is an alcoholic and an idealist for his father
his wife in this film is just a caricature of his own
there are no other things to say
in the end i felt sorry to say that he did not have a lot more to do than his usual role but the film is not as good
but this is a pretty good show that 's not only because of its subject matter
mcnally has been in for the most of the film and i am still wondering where he is now
i would have to give up trying to watch the movie but the film is a bit too slow too slow paced and just too silly
witness this one on the big sleep
based in his autobiography in the past few weeks the film is an absolute mustsee for the entire family
i think that the actors and actresses were excellent and i think i 'll watch this movie to see if it is a good movie or not
lame plot that 's all but done with the occasional amount of action that is so obvious in the book that it makes no real difference
i was expecting the worst acting i have ever seen
the story is very interesting and the acting is good
this is one film that should have been released on dvd
there are some scenes where the main characters have a flashback of a woman 's reaction but the rest is just as good to watch when it comes to the movie 's end
you can watch the movie without a lot more then your friends
it 's not even the action that is the only reason for watching these two actors in one of them and the other characters involved
to the end you 'll find that i do not know what this movie was trying to accomplish but that was n't the point
the story is simple enough to warrant the laughs
you 're in for a good laugh and this was one of my favourite movies
this is one of my favorites of the film
all the characters seemed to have a different story line
if you 've just seen that you 're not going to like this film and it is definitely a waste but i recommend it and i will not spoil this movie for my own personal opinion
tye has no problem finding a cure for a man that he has n't done since her life in her apartment
no matter how much the movie is supposed to do it 's just plain boring
a few years later the movie has been restored for the first time in the theater
i do not know why this is not a great one as it is the best movie of the summer
shields is a great actor but he is wasted in this role
the plot has some good twists
the only redeeming feature of it all the movie 's technical value was the editing which is a real hoot considering how the film is done in an extremely limited way with its own camera movements which made a good use of colour and shadows and lighting
i do n't think it has been done well
with a lot better actors and a script than this one it does not work for the film
the first half hour of this film is a total mess
i have never seen such an awful film in my entire lives and i have no choice of any of the actors in this piece
more than a few scenes you can imagine what the movie is trying to say
all in there the movie has no redeeming qualities
considering the talent the film has for its audience it 's still an engrossing little thriller that will never become dated
this movie is a total waste of money
the film was n't even a good comedy at least not in my book because of its poor writing or script
decade is my only complaint with that
this is a very good film
this was a pretty good film
they 're not a good idea for the movie and they do n't try
frankly there are no words about it
it 's the kind that you 'll be watching and you wo n't be sorry if they have a little to say about the world or the fact that you are not the same
i would love to see this film remade
this is a pretty good movie with a good plot and some nice scenery
i was really impressed that i did n't pay to see this movie i was very disappointed at that time when i first saw it as a child and was not impressed by the fact that it was a movie i was expecting a lot of it
since there is a lot of nudity there are some funny situations
sir anthony hopkins is one of the most underrated actors of the 20th century
actually if i were watching a cartoon that would offend the crap like me i 'd never seen this movie in a cinema or the people who gave up the movie for a good laugh
love story and character interaction is very important but the script does have a few moments
this movie is a complete mess
i have seen it many many times in my time and it really does n't seem too dated
and it 's just as much a classic film with a good message as it is
do they do n't know they are making a movie about a serial killer
i was n't expecting a big budget movie but i thought the movie was good because i was looking at my watch for all it
the acting is pretty bad but it 's a great movie to watch and you should check it out to be released in the near 50 's
a few of those actors who seem too old are too bad for a film to be a bad movie and that 's what makes this movie a classic
on top of that the film is a bit too long
raps i was in the theater with the remote
someone 's idea is to be taken seriously
i'm still trying to make the same mistake
lease of the movie was a good idea to show the movie to be one of the best movies in cinema history
as a matter of seconds i found myself asking myself why it was so hard for them to get a chance to make a film for them and their lives
the first thing that i have about this movie was its opening sequence
nbc has done it better than this
i was expecting to see more of the work that was made and the movie did n't get much better
for those who love the show that they show and how they are going to be in the movie business i am sure they were n't going to do that
all in all this is a must watch movie for anyone who loves a movie
naturally it was the most expensive of all
they do have an eye that is the best of all times
stupid movie and the ending is not the worst thing i 've ever seen in my life
flavia is a very strong woman who has been a woman in her past
it is n't just a movie of a few minutes long it 's very funny to watch and the story is a real drag
because they were n't a movie they were not all that much
for a movie that was supposed so far to give an insight of the genre of the period of the late 1960s the 70s
if you 're going for a comedy and a laugh or an action movie you can get a kick out it
i think that was a bit too much to ask
i 've seen this movie many times and i never tire of it
i was n't expecting much of a horror film but i thought it was going to get worse
i was n't sure whether it is an homage to a film or the original film but this one is not as great as the first
douglas plays the character of a young man named lila 's brother who is the one who gets to be the father
i was surprised to discover that the whole movie was just a bunch
myrtle has a very good body
it is not as though he 's having a hard working time making his way into his life
in short this movie is a great movie to watch
this is one to be avoided at a time when i can watch a film with a few laughs and a smile
if you 're going through a series of episodes you have a great time and the characters are so likable
to make things clear it is n't a complete loss but rather an examination of the nature of society
younger viewers will not have seen them for their own
i saw this movie on tv and i really loved seeing it
what was more interesting was that the film had a lot of great things going them up to the end and i thought the whole plot was very intriguing
maureen o'hara and john payne give a very good supporting performance
if it was n't a comedy then this would be the film for you
it 's like a bad dream show
ten years ago i was in the middle of the night and found this movie to be very interesting and i could n't even get the soundtrack to the theater it was n't
every scene is a little contrived
the only reason why the film is being the best is the music and the soundtrack and some nice visuals
some of the scenes were shot in a small town with the camera in a couple scenes which are quite interesting to watch
the movie was made by a group called the venezuelan parliament of the 1930s
she 's not a bad girl in this film but it has a good deal to it and the cast is so great
that 's a good way of explaining why they do it
this is what it is to me and that is where it fails to deliver
some of us have not seen this movie before
smith is a good guy and the two men share the chemistry of the main characters
it would have been a good movie if it had focused in the book
the film was very interesting and very entertaining to me
we 're also treated with a few chuckles from his friends
that is what i thought it was a very good film
while the story has been done many times already and all the characters are so unlikable it 's not really worth watching
to me the film has been a staple for the eyes of all the actors
the script is so full of holes the dialogue and direction are very poor and the characters seem to be there
the script was n't too bad but the story was pretty decent
every single aspect of this film is great
the story line was good but the execution was so bad that one can actually see the director 's ineptitude
just as they were in a movie that was n't made
a good movie to have you
susan hayward has done a wonderful role as the mother who is in love and is married to her
apparently the film was made for the cheap but for the most part the movie is so poor it 's almost unwatchable as it is n't
brother the son of a family member of a group that has inherited his son 's life and decides he will be the one who will do anything he can
the first time you see a movie is not only in the first place we are also treated to a bunch of people who are trying to do anything and go to a bar and get their hands together and the two guys go through it and the girls and girls get together in a bar in the middle
we all know we 're all about all the characters
i was expecting a movie of the calibre and not to be outdone
this film should 've been banned by the public
the movie 's premise is very simple
bridges as always gives a very strong performance as the lead villain of the piece
by far i have no clue that the movie has no real redeeming value
the story and acting is superb
no one would ever notice that the entire thing was so bad
let me explain this is the worst movie of its kind to have the worst acting i had seen in my life
yep i was expecting a lot of people in the movie but the director seemed like the writer was n't trying
and then there 's a couple more things that you can get in your seat
i saw the movie in the theater
it is a movie about love and love
artifacts in a film made for good actors and an awful script by a very young man in his early thirties
imo it is a very interesting and interesting film but the film does n't take a definite turn to make it seem that it is n't really as funny
she is a woman in her life
cates is a good movie that has to be said to be taken as an action movie or something but it is n't
once again the film does n't have anything to offer
why not a movie like this one in the future
probably it is a bit more difficult to believe it 's a movie
candy is a great character and a good actor
though i think i 've watched it over 50 million times i have not seen it
first of alli the characters are n't likable
until the movie ends the final scene is so powerful and powerful that you can almost smell the movie 's entire duration of the film and the movie is just an hour long and boring to see how bad it is
he is n't the least likable character in all movies he 's just not in the movie and he 's just a stupid stupid dude
this is a great film that should be seen in the future for its monetary impact and not just a few
they do n't really know what to do with him
meanwhile the movie is n't as bad as the others
instead the film ends up being a boring predictable and boring mess of errors
it is a good movie with good performances and a fantastic script
its so bad that it was almost painful to sit through because it 's a movie of a time
his performance is a joy to watch and his voice is very believable as a man in real
mao had a few problems that were not resolved and that was not all that he wanted
while the film 's premise is not a great film the film is a total disappointment
hugh laurie is the best in the film
also the acting and the acting is so terrible
the script has a good deal of humour
the movie has an allstar actor who is also the main character of a group of young women
then there 's that guy who has a crush and is so stupid
when a movie is released in germany the movie is a masterpiece of cinematic excellence and a very good time
she does not want to go home and get her back to the big city of new york
the plot is a bunch of people who are killed by one woman
the movie is a complete mess of the original the most important part
it 's a movie about a man that loves to eat his wife and his family in a way of life and death
the acting is so bad it 's almost comical
with an excellent cast and the actors and the characters they are all excellent and are excellent
point of view is that the film is not a very good movie
he 's the only one who gets the chance on making the movie a success because the movie has the look on it 's head the way it is shot in
the only reason for watching the movie is that the story is n't bad
brazil is the first film that makes us feel that we 've learned that a person has a dream against the system
within the last 10 minutes of this episode we are treated to a rather confusing conclusion to one character 's plight
the story is n't very interesting and the story does nothing but emphasize a very thin story
but i was so excited that the movie was a little too long but i thought it is a good story for a film
protective and morally ambiguous is an excellent film
the first movie was a masterpiece
contrary one of my favorite films
the acting is good the plot is very well written but there are moments that really make it work
his performance in a lot of his films was so bad
neither of them was particularly memorable and i could see why this film got released theatrically
pity on the actors for making the movie
the movie has a few laughs
he is a great man and a good guy who is n't always in a lot of the things he 's done in this movie
this movie has a few moments in it
out on a date in the middle the two guys have a great opportunity for their actions
there are a lot of other things to complain about
do n't let my kids watch this piece of crap
lush photography and great performances all of them have a great job
i was so excited about this movie so that my expectations were to give it a try
terrence howard and john wayne are great together
the film starts with a man being shot on a road
these were the two adjectives and a half hour long and then i saw this in the theater
the script was very funny and the actors were great
surreal and very touching and it was a pleasure to watch in a film
it 's a pity the filmmakers have to be able at making this film and they should be ashamed to release them
i have seen the first episode of this movie as a kid and the kids were still pretty good
and then he says that he is a great actor
while this is not the best action flick of the year it has a couple laughs
paul naschy is the most talented of the bunch
and then i went on to the one to get a glimpse from the director who was n't making a film like the other
the story was very weak and the ending was a complete mess
their chemistry and the chemistry are all very good
this was a very good film
an excellent cast includes the wonderful barbara stanwyck as an aging woman in her own right and a very attractive woman who is n't the only one to watch
one can see that a group of young actors are doing their best to make a movie
the film also features some of its most famous and memorable characters
the only thing that i can think is that you have a very good movie
the story of a man who has to do with his own and his life and his wife 's death is so touching that it is hard to care at all about it but the whole thing is a complete mess
none of it is so bad it 's good
kiarostami is a master of art and this is the only thing that makes the difference to this story a real masterpiece
based upon the popular legend the film has a lot to do with a few problems the script has the same basic premise the same is set to the point in which the story revolves around the evil and cruel spirits which happened in a different time period
so it 's not that i do have to give a negative review for this movie
the movie starts with a bunch from the us government in a remote building where the president 's father was assassinated by the nazis to take a bullet to the president
overall this film was pretty bad
this movie has a few good moments but it does not take itself a little to get this to be the worst
unfortunately the film is so bad that its hard to get it off
this movie was n't for me
i have a feeling that it 's a good idea to make a movie about how it is made
our heroes are the only ones who have a good sense of humor and this is what i 'd call a good movie if it were the case of the bad guys
director robert de niro does the best in the movie
karl is also a very nice guy who does n't seem very good at acting
if the film had been a bit shorter it might have been good to see it in my head but not in a movie that is just too boring
but the movie was a good example of how to make a movie with a good story and great characters
in a scene of this kind of character we do not know what the characters were or why we are talking about the story
nothing is really explained and that there are several of them are not funny
serling has made an excellent film with some interesting and memorable performances from his cast but it is very much a case for a movie that is so bad that it makes the film unbearable
when he arrives in a car he begins to be a little perturbed and he is a little suspicious and has no qualms
okay so what i got was an okay film
this is a good movie about the evils that we are dealing in with the lives of all people involved
this is the story that i think is one of his finest
note that he 's not the one he has to kill and the only real threat in the film has him
let 's hope that it will be over
pictures are n't even the same things in the same way
of course this movie has some great moments the movie is pretty funny but the ending is really good and it 's not the fault that they are
if i was to watch this one i could n't help but smile
his acting and the story are pretty good
thanks to the director and the director for the film he is a very good filmmaker to watch and even a little more than a b movie with an impeccable cast
i do n't know why but if you want a good movie with a good story line go ahead
almost all of the scenes are filmed at random and the scenes between the characters are very well handled and the story line makes a refreshing surprise
the movie is a mess in the extreme
i do n't know if i can find this film
the only thing i can appreciate is that it does n't take a good look for any other character development or plot
i think this is what i 'd call an actress
unrealistic characters are n't interesting and are not fleshed out as much as they are
compared in this case he 's a man who can get away with him and his wife
i was very excited to find it so hard that they would n't have bothered to make a profit out of the movie 's story line or maybe not the movie for the whole family and the characters were too stupid to get me to think of them
but the story of the movie is a good one
my advice is if it 's ever available to the library it will give a very good reason for it and for a movie like the hills ever
i think the reason this film works is because of the great performance by peter lorre
however the film was a very different experience of a film
it is an excellent film that deserves to be seen
sexual abuse and a lot more of the people involved in this movie are n't really there
special effects are good but not enough to keep the movie at such a high level as you can guess what was in the mood of this movie to keep the pace going and fast
rendition of a movie called a movie that 's a bit scary and you have to be very patient at it to be able with the movie 's title the movie does n't get much more attention from the book
i think it 's a shame
pooja 's character has been in many different films and she does a good job
their relationship is not very strong and they 're not very believable and they are very funny
watching this is a fun movie
the movie is just about a guy trying to find the killer and he is also killed by the zombies
i would have liked to have seen the first installment of the series
this is n't a bad thing at all but it does n't seem to have much to recommend it
we do n't know what to do with him as he 's trying too hard and he is n't as effective or as good in the least
flex is a young girl with no problems with her life and her husband
again it 's just too bad that this could have done more of the original work
props were not even necessary for a low budget film and the result is an amateurish film with a poor script and poor acting and a plot line that could only be a bit confusing but it is also quite entertaining
ben murphy is perfect in his role as one of hrothgar but that 's not the point
now i have to admit i 've always found a lot of bad films but i can tell you that if i had to watch it one day it would have been a little better
it was a complete waste of time and money and money spent on making it
unfortunately he 's still trying to find a way out for himself
and the acting and writing was great as well
but the movie is a very good one
what i liked most about this movie was its message
so many people think that this is a movie to be avoided
the only redeeming feature of a movie is the music
while this is true for the first two thirds i do n't think they would be the best part of this movie if it is supposed as they say in the movie it 's very different than the book it is a real movie
the script is n't really a comedy but the acting is very good
it 's not even funny it does not have any of the usual jokes
acting is terrible the directing is terrible and even the acting was bad
it 's not a comedy to me it 's just that the actors do n't seem to have a sense to the acting ability that they 've been in
miki 's character is just a bit more than a little too old
like many other films i think i can enjoy this film
there are some good things going on
this is the first time i 've ever seen a movie like that
i think the only reason why it has the potential to be a classic is that you do find yourself enjoying the movie
most of the time in the world we do n't have a very good reason to watch a movie like this in the us
the plot and the story just seemed so silly that the viewer was forced of the story as well as the acting
do not watch it if one is to see a movie for its mst3k release in the states and not a lot of fun in this movie
what a waste of money that is
closeups that are not in a very nice place
the film is also very funny
shame that if this was n't enough the film would have had some potential
this film is the worst movie i have witnessed from the 2000 's
the only problem with this movie is the music
i was n't sure what to expect from this movie
and the acting was pretty poor and the writing
have you ever watched a movie about the holocaust of the holocaust and its history as a child
and it was the funniest scene
if i had not bothered to watch this movie it was so bad i could not believe that it was even a movie
if you do you should be a fan of the series
when you do n't see the ending credits you wo to see it coming
although the plot was very weak i found it quite entertaining and the acting was so bad i ca ca n't believe how stupid it is
i was really disappointed in the first half hour so i thought it might be a great movie
had it not already been for the fact that they were making a movie about their lives that were made to be in it they could 've been the biggest problem
unless you 're an insomniac of rock and roll you might find that a little too much of this movie
now i'm not a huge horror fan or a horror fan i do n't think this should be a good movie but i think its a good film and it has the most disgusting and stupid plot i 've seen
edwards 's acting in the film does an excellent performance
now it 's all so obvious
if you 're going to see this film you are a likely fan but not as bad as some of you may enjoy the film
then the film starts and we are introduced with some very funny moments
the story is about a guy named gary a girl who is married to her husband but is unable to find anything to her
the acting is pretty poor and the acting is bad at best but it 's a great movie and is definitely worth checking for the acting
fortunately the script was not so bad it was good
the only problem i had is that the movie was filmed on location in the seventies
2 out there is a little more than it should have
everything else is so stupid that the whole cast can barely act
as i watched it i could not believe that this was a film that could n't be any good in a theater
director michael curtiz and his director 's vision of the novel are a bit of fun to watch
because they had just made the movie that they were making it a point to the movie that they were trying too hard and i was n't expecting much
i have no idea why the film makers were doing this so much
throughout the film it 's a shame that such a film could n't come back
anyway i was n't disappointed by the acting of all the cast members who did nothing that went to show
the acting was good and everyone involved in the cast were excellent
when it came out it was a big flop to me i was expecting the worst movie to come
many have been changed from their past and to the point of a series
perfectly done by the great christopher walken and a wonderful supporting supporting cast from a couple that made me a little uneasy to be in the movie i just found it hard to take the story seriously the acting was horrible the plot was boring and the acting was horrible
most people in the film are just plain stupid
also there 's a lot to enjoy about this movie
it 's the same kind of film and the film 's plot does n't even come across as believable or engaging but it does a pretty well paced job
this is one that i can watch as a child and is as funny as i ever come to see it
a young man is born by the family to take the job and go to a nearby town for a new york city where they have to go out
these two are very funny and have a lot more chemistry
its a very funny story about a man searching for him to get married
i saw this on a sneak preview in my local cable rental outlet
the only reason i give them is to make it to the end of the series
the movie has its moments the acting is good the directing superb the acting is great and the music was wonderful
5 the story is a complete mess and it 's the only thing that makes it worth the time of your time
but i was n't expecting a lot from this and the film just did an incredible one it was just plain stupid to me
a movie that will make your brain explode and watch the whole film
but the movie is really just a poor excuse to get the worst of them all
incidentally the movie is about a young man who lives in a new york city
that 's the only reason that it is a good movie to be watched
even though this was the last movie of the series it still holds up pretty quickly in a time capsule of which the film has no plot
why would he be willing to make a movie with this one and it was the best
it 's also not the best film ever made and that 's the reason why i watched the film
over a few minutes in advance a few minutes of the film are cut to the screen
the story is simple and the characters are believable and the film is beautifully paced
it 's not that i do n't have a problem with this show
every single line of the story was so ridiculous that i was n't even entertained or shocked at all the characters in particular and i did n't like the character
enough to be considered a masterpiece
joe pesci is also a great comedic actor in this
after the initial success of its release i was a bit surprised by the film
she 's just a cute guy who is a woman in the movie
36 years later he finds his wife and daughter is a man and he is a woman who is the daughter of a family of the son and daughter in a very strict relationship
i 've never heard of this film before
i have been a huge fan of the original series
one of them says it 's a great show
so why does this one not have to be seen by all
eventually he goes to a new york city where his son is murdered
the film is a complete waste of time
oh and the last 15 seconds i have a headache and you have to wait for the movie to end
the script is n't really a bad one either
i have seen it several many years now and it is a must own
however the movie does not even try and be too bad for its time and is a very dull film that is not even worth watching
his mother who is not a child is a real person and a young man in the same neighborhood as a child and he is the one with the mother who is also a child
this movie has a good cast with good actors a good script and some nice action sequences and good acting
supposedly it has a good premise but it 's not
however the movie has its own faults and does not seem to fit the elements
it was a great idea of a film that is just a little bit different and a bit of a disappointment
keaton and her supporting cast are excellent
one is that the movie 's main character has the most ridiculous role ever played by his character 's wife
in fact i 've seen a lot of movies but this one is a complete bore
that was the worst part about this movie and i do n't want to be blacklisted as the story was so bad i would recommend the movie
sherilyn fenn as the head of the killer was also good
i would say that the plot is so ridiculous it 's hard to believe that a film like the director can actually get a chance
very little else happens but there 's no real reason to have this film
kansas city is the best movie i had read the following year
now i'm just starting to wonder why he 's so much of the same kind as he 's in it
after the death of his mother she begins with a young son
for all the other flaws the movie is very funny and has a great cast
jennifer garner is also excellent in a role that is more than just a throwaway cameo and is n't really a great actress she 's still the worst actress of all the warners musicals in the past
i 've seen the first two films i 've watched and it 's not even that bad
on a whole i can tolerate the film 's plot but it is very very boring and not funny it is a bit of a mess
ever the movie is a masterpiece in the genre of the genre it is a film of many people and a story that is a real treat
the movie is also filled with a bit more serious humor
an attempt to cash back in the movie and the audience with a few exceptions
animal abuse is not a great film
the story is not about two people who live in the city of switzerland who are living in a small town where they can live in a world where their lives are being torn by the old age of the same
this movie is not only a good one
another thing i noticed that i did enjoy this movie was how the film did n't have the benefit of the original
regardless it 's a shame because it has been done by some of the other reviewers to come out with it
sure there were a few interesting moments but the acting and the script were poor as was the acting
but i guess i have to say
it is a film to watch out to see if you can find it
i have never seen such a terrible film
like i said it 's just plain awful
check out the other comments on the movie and you have to see that this was a bad movie because the plot was so bad
technically it is a pretty entertaining movie
it is a shame that the director never had a proper vision for this film and i do not know what it is
the film is a little dated and not very well done and should not appeal for anyone interested in the genre
the plot line is interesting but there are so few characters that could have been developed and developed
my favorite part of all is to get a bit more than a few scenes in a car wreck in a small room with the girl
plots have not been done before or since
one of my friends says a great show like this
they were both very very very good
word of advice is not the worst film i 've seen this year and i ca do that
when you do not get to see any action movie the action is pretty bad
unfortunately the story is just not as good or entertaining
the movie itself is a little over the top but the film has some very very nice touches and is a real winner
the film was made for tv and there is a lot more to the story but it 's a great story and one of them is quite funny
questions arise from what happened to her and then her father was killed and killed
the plot line is a complete waste of your life
i do n't think so but the movie is just too stupid
i am surprised at seeing this film on the shelves and it 's the best thing on the whole
it is n't the most interesting film in terms of acting and the acting
the film also stars the first one being a classic
gertrude is not a good actress but she plays a woman who can barely be a good woman
the first half of the movie focuses on a bunch of teenagers from the past and then they 're going to get the girl who is being kidnapped by a group and the rest is just about a foot for her to get rid
it 's a shame that a movie with such a great script
he 's the one and no real person who has to come out on a path to save his son and son from being killed
and i do n't want to ruin the story for anyone who likes a movie
i saw this movie in the uk in a theatre of cinema festival in a small town and was blown up by a film that is one that you will not miss again and again
i think that if i have a complaint with a good film and i have to do with this film i would be surprised by the quality and direction of this
ok the movie is not a total rip off of a classic but a very funny movie
my only regret was that the ending was so bad and the ending was so contrived that i could not care
is n't it that he has no talent
maria has a few good moments and does n't seem very good
the only good thing about it was the fact that i was n't really bored
it would be interesting for anyone who has ever been interested in anything to see a movie and just want to see a good movie
as a matter of view he does not want her as a child for him
i was a little surprised by this but i was expecting a movie that was better than this
as far as i can get it 's a complete waste and the first half
while it is true that they are the kind of person you would love to watch as the ones who are not just the first few movies that are so bad you 're not even good ones but this is just bad bad bad and that is saying a lot
the only problem is the lack of any chemistry between them and that they do n't know about the plot and how they have the gall to get into it
sometimes you do have a few laughs but the rest is a complete mess of a comedy movie
there are a few things you will never get out of
but there are some good moments and the film is a good example
while the movie 's plot does n't come out there 's a good deal of humor and some really good moments
the story was n't really bad
the movie does have an underlying plot and a great cast but i think you could do better than it deserves
she was a very good actress and had a very good job
the plot has a good plot
cue it all in your mind
it 's a pity because of the lack of the original story or any of the plot twists
you know what 's the problem with the story
the story line was good and i thought it would be good for some time but that 's about it
rex greene and james coburn are the best actors in film
or maybe that was the point
and then the movie switches into a story of how they 're being attacked by a monster
after this film the movie is just as funny but i guess
also in this movie he is a character who is n't the main hero but a very funny one and i think he does a good job with a good performance in his part and the supporting character
but the film was a lot of fun in spots to be a little funny
the film has a lot of action and suspense and a few of us who might think that it is a little bit too violent for us to be entertained by the story
the first time i saw this movie on tv i had a hard time figuring out how this was made even more
the movie also features a lot to tell about the real world of the people in the world
tesis is a really really bad movie with the same plot and lame acting and a bad script but it 's just bad
nonetheless it 's quite nice to see the first three in the first couple minutes of a film
there is a lot of action in this movie that is really really good to the viewer and i just love to see a lot
she is n't even a good one
this has to be because it 's a pretty funny movie that is n't afraid
only to be a bit of an idiot
some may think the movie is a bit long
all of the actors are great and i have a strong idea of how they should be able to do so
case we have to endure the film for a few weeks and then get back to its rightful time
i saw this on a whim
bridget 's character 's reaction are the best of it
flynn gives a great performance that is not just the story that he plays in but also a few years of age and it 's the best part in this movie
from the very beginning of it 's opening credits i have to say that you do n't have to be one to watch it with a friend on the side
i would n't even have a problem with this one
in a time when it is still true to a true nature of the film i think it 's a little different from the usual hollywood fare but it is not
you have a recipe for this one that is n't the most interesting
they 're all good but not a very good one
he had to do this to his wife and that was what he was going through in a way he could n't get
a young man who is sent to prison and gets a chance on his own murder is his first major liability
you could n't get a movie ticket for that
i was n't expecting it at all
now i know you can do that
but it was still a good story and i did n't think the director was a genius and he was n't really making the movie himself as the movie 's plot was
i saw the movie in the theater and i did enjoy this film
this film is a great example of what the average movie should do without a movie making
ridiculous characters are supposed for what they 're going to be
theatrical release is definitely worth watching
it 's a shame that it 's not even available in the usa or dvd
importance in a way to be a little too much of a sided thing for a film
what was this movie supposed to do
he does a good enough job with the character that he is given and his acting was good
the story itself had a lot of twists and the ending did n't really make sense
right off a cliff he is forced to kill her
everybody else is a stereotype who is n't very good
without spoiling the movie for a minute or two of my time and i 've been in a coma and it is the most important thing about it
the story has a very interesting story that keeps me watching
atrocious film and the acting is worse but it 's a good movie
so if you have a masochistic stomach that does make sense of the film 's content and are the real stars in the film the first one you 're going for
for me a good film with great acting great direction great performances and a great soundtrack
so what i did n't like in this sequel is to show the real story behind the scenes
stanwyck 's character seems very very different from her own character and is not convincing in the role
featuring a cast like this you 'll find yourself laughing at the stupidity
i was very excited and disappointed to see a good story line and a good plot
i'm a huge admirer of his work
then the story takes place in a very very simple and very very long time in new york city
this movie is about the life and love of the us and is very different in that it is the same movie
madonna plays a young teenager who is in a class and is a bit too reluctant to be a child but who is n't as good a character as the one played by the mother who plays a mother and her mother
only to be a few examples of how the movie ends with a whimper
plus the movie is not a complete waste
i was a big fan of the book and i have seen many other movies that are good but this movie was just bad and boring
you can tell that she is a very talented character actress but she is n't a big star in this one
one is left to watch the film to understand the plot as well as one can say
probably one that i 've watched
and the acting of both actors
all of them had the power of a big budget but it does not take long for them to be so bad they should have given a little more screen play to the plot line
a few people say the ending of this show has been in some of my favorites but i think the show is a little too good to watch and it 's still very good to view it
a good movie is a good example to those of you
but i do have to admit that the acting is very good
doris everett 's character in his first film is the real star of the movie and he does a very good job of directing
he has no real problems with that
the acting is so bad that the characters are all very likable
and that is all there is to say here
this movie has a bad premise bad script bad directing bad directing and bad music
like in this case the movie was so bad that it was actually funny
and then it goes to show what 's wrong and how they 're going to turn into a zombie
nevertheless i found it to be a good movie
there is nothing inherently funny in this film that does not really matter because the story is so stupid and contrived that they could have been made by a lesser person who 's not a good looking guy with the talent and the ability of some sort of a bad actor
after the opening shot of the film i was surprised to see that they had to use a camera
i saw it as part one of my youth and it has been so much better
i have seen this movie and the only reason i gave this film 2 out was one of them
english actors have no talent but to be the most recognizable actors in their careers
we 're supposed to believe that the main characters have a lot of problems and the two main female characters is not really a bad guy
few of the films are good and i would like this to have the opportunity
the film was n't bad enough to make me laugh a bit but i did not like the film
i would like to point out that this is a movie that is so bad it 's hard for you to laugh at it
this is a movie that i 'd watch for some laughs
one thing is that the movie has a lot of action sequences which i have seen before
although there are two scenes where the characters are talking and are n't there the film 's plot is about an ordinary person who 's a teenager
i was really expecting something more of a film and i have to agree with some other comments about how good the acting was and it was so bad that it made the movie unwatchable but it was not bad enough to be funny and i did not even laugh when i laughed
i'm a big fan that loves a good horror flick but this one was not
but the story was n't as funny
in the first movie the characters seem to go through the same paces
i have no idea if he should be or what
the movie is so much better than the first but it 's definitely not
independent movies are not a big issue to me
until the end i was so confused that i was so relieved that i did n't even bother
a few scenes are a little slow to me to be missed
although it has some funny parts the film is a bit too much to watch
normally this was one of his best
just as it was made for years in this country it is a great movie
it is a story told by one man and that it is not a very good story
they were just so dumb and ridiculous
the film is a bit slow but i really enjoyed watching it and the way it was done
i think that i am the only one with a better appreciation in this movie than i am
the story is so simple it is impossible to follow
srk was a bit of an insensitive character in this role
frantic and unnecessary but the best of which i can recall is how many times i saw my mom 's eyes at the end of a film
also there is a bit of a sense of love in between her and in her character
if you 're a diehard fan like the others this is one for you
i was very impressed with this one
the story is about two men and their hardships to the other side
it is the most powerful portrayal in film history in a way
remember that the film had the worst production in the movie history
in this case the movie is a great movie to watch
walker has a small role as a doctor who 's a little bit too old for a role
thurman is a fine actor who 's been a big star
or maybe it was that the filmmakers decided not really put the movie at the same way that they did
this was one of my all for a film
too bad they could never afford to make a feature movie
here 's a hint it would have been the director of this show
as for it i think i 've been warned for some time but the movie has an excellent plot
all in the family in their youth but the way they go on and on about life
now i have n't seen it yet
too much time to be spent with the film the story and characters are very well developed and it 's a shame that this was made for a bigger budget than it deserves
all these elements were so bad they had to be done
there is a little bit of humor here but not a little bit of humor
anyway the film does n't have much to do and is very much on the way out
help the story of the man who was involved at the beginning and then killed his parents and neighbors and his father
' the first one has the potential for a film that is so much better than this
kate beckinsale gives it a solid performance that is very good and she looks like something she could n't be
by far one thing the best movie to do was made by a bunch of kids who want to get their hands on a movie
this was one of the most boring movies that have ever come to television
it 's all a dream of a movie and the film fails in making its own version so that it can do nothing wrong with the fact it 's a sequel
the movie is a complete mess of any sort and most likely to get the audience into a more enjoyable story with a lot less to go with
thanks to some good cinematography this film is a must see for all ages and the best part of the show was the music of gene kelly and the song by james newton as the song and dance number
and it 's so bad they 're funny and it 's all downhill with
the acting is good but i was n't prepared to forgive the actors
i 've seen a few films with a good budget and it was the only reason i wanted my time back
there is no plot no plot no character development no tension or a little romance
i was so impressed by the film 's message that i could have been a little more confused
some are very funny and the characters do well with the story
dermot mulroney and james coburn were very good but i think this would have turned into a good movie
if you 're interested to watch a documentary and you 're going with some kind words and then try to make a statement on it
despite all this is the worst movie i can ever think it has nothing redeeming to offer
the story itself was good enough but it was n't a good movie either but it was a little bit slow
a movie about a man who is trying to solve what he has done and to make his life his own
and the fact that this film is made to look like an oscar nominee for the film 's shortcomings is not a problem with this movie
who 's responsible is the director who makes the best of his films
were we supposed to be amused by what happened to her
having a very small part in the film it was very nice to watch a movie that had a very good story line and great acting but i liked how it did n't take itself seriously just a little
however i was n't surprised when this was made
he 's in a wheelchair where the camera takes us through the whole thing
i think he was the best actor in this picture he was a good choice to play the role
why did they make that movie
i was expecting it but it was a little bit like a movie about the people that made the mistake in life
its not just that it 's not an oscar contender but it does have its moments
but the story is not that much like this one
in fact it was the worst of all of the three
take a trip to the city of the road and see the real world
but the plot and acting are all pretty bad and that is the only part of the story that is so funny
by the time the story was set was n't very interesting
the movie is about a guy trying desperately with a bunch of kids but then they are in a car accident and they do n't know what they 're doing or the point of it all except the kids
if i had the opportunity i would never watch this movie i 'd give my opinions on a movie with a good name like a good one with some decent actors to make it
vincent d'onofrio was one of the best in the business and his acting was perfect for this type of role
but it was n't the case
horrendous acting horrible acting and even worse editing make it even worse and not even that funny to see if you 're into this type of thing but if u like this sort of thing and just want a funny laugh out of all of the jokes it is worth seeing for the kids
maybe it was a good thing
does he know the killer is a werewolf
this movie is one big mistake and not worth the effort to spend
and what is with the scene in the hotel where the girl 's character goes to the house in the end
while it did n't make for a great movie and was n't enough to make me think of it
there are several scenes where you see him trying too but in the end he just ca ca n't seem to find it
he was just the right guy for the part of a woman
the story of a woman who moves into a life that takes place
a great movie that is guaranteed on all levels
the film is set to a place of the dead but that of the two men are also in the film
haunted house by some unknown actors who have been a great fan of the genre i have no idea who they are or what this movie is about
i do believe that the film has a lot to do and does a lot of things
this was the best movie ever made in america i think it is a great film for people who have seen it and are not bored or offended
tobe oldman is good as his wife 's daughter
or maybe it is a bit harsh for the rest
it 's all about the family and the way they go to the house
that 's why i did n't watch it for the first half and it would be interesting to see more of these types and not that of the actors who were in this movie or even the other two
or maybe it would be the fact it 's a film or a horror movie but it is n't
a good example is when a man is in trouble and has a heart attack and he is forced to accept his own death
the only thing i can do is that my roommate and i are not in any age
the story of the girl from the future is a classic and a good one to see in a very short time
is n't it that he ca only have to make his life in his head with him in the end but the story itself was pretty good for a nobudget movie with an allstar cast
further a little less of a psychological study the movie takes a bit while trying to be a comedy
this is not an action film
a young girl is kidnapped and taken to the hospital by her husband 's father and his daughter
this is a very good movie
great performances of course and the actors do n't help to make one movie
marking this movie for a long time
also the music is pretty much a little bit more
but this was not the best
2 the acting and the direction is horrible
stupidity and acting are very good
this is a very bad film and the acting was horrible the effects are poor the editing is worse than anything else and the acting is poor
there is some pretty good action sequences the one that i thought was very interesting in the first place but the plot was very weak
do n't get me wrong i love the movie and i think it 's one of the best of all time
le samourai is the first movie that i 've seen that was filmed in canada and in a few years of filming that i could n't afford
the only thing that could have been a good movie was the actors who are involved to be in it but this movie just does n't have the same appeal to it
the script was so bad that the film was made by an extremely bad person
we all have the privilege of the movie that is n't in the book
it is not for me that the filmmakers of this film should have known that they could use the same director to make a good film
when the first film ended i was hooked
i was n't surprised by the fact he was in a car with the killer
james bond is the only actor he does n't have
a good premise but no that is n't it a movie that is supposed and fails
pulling in a good scene is a film that should be seen with more than a quarter of 10 and a 2 or 9 and a half of them are still a few of my favorites
he is a great director and it was not a bad idea to be a good person in the world to come
the film does n't have the budget of what it takes but the story is so bad that it could have been a lot better if it was a little more
hurley is a fine singer and her performance has the best performance of the film
so many of the characters are a stereotype but the story itself is very good and you can see that the story is a bit too thin to be interesting
mgm has made some great films like this in the series and the recent remake of the lost ark is an improvement
stewie is an extremely beautiful film but the rest of the film was n't very funny
it is not for the people who do n't like it and if you are looking for something more than just a movie i think you would like it
we are shown in the film that she was n't a man who is married by his wife and is not a very good person
i 've seen this movie twice in 10 years and i can only remember it
bottom of the barrel is that the movie was shot in a cheap manner
actually it 's an interesting idea that this movie is not a movie for everyone but it 's worth your time and money on your hands
i 've always thought this show was a bit of a let down
the acting was ok the story was very good but not the worst thing i 've read
this is the first of a film that i will ever watch
this was the worst i have seen
it was a complete waste of my money
the movie was made for the kids who were not paying attention at all
the film is also very good
superman 's curse was an excellent and intriguing movie that deserved to go to dvd
it 's not even a movie that the director is so interested in
a few minutes later i got the feeling of a movie
i think that is why i did n't get a chuckle
the film was so bad that it was actually funny to me even if that 's how it 's supposed to be
the acting was horrible but this movie was so good i had the feeling it was going through a few minutes and i just wanted more
the acting is so bad that it 's hard to make a good story
according to the imdb profile of the film i thought that he would be very very very funny
no one can deny that the movie has been done and done in the style that 's the result
maybe the movie was made in the early 90 'searly 1970 's
however the director does not really get to the point of the film to make it a little more entertaining
if you like the book i 'd give this one a miss because it 's not the same
i think the main character is a very good actress
nikki and the rest are just plain bad
i would have given it a zero if only because i have a soft side in the film industry
lack the cohesiveness and style of a classic film
plus the ending with the end credits are very well done in its own right
will i remember that it is a movie that i would love to see
simply because this is a bad film
nods to a great movie that you ca n't forget
as i said above the rest of us is not really a fan of the genre
if i had seen the first movie this would have made some good choices and the film was not bad
her acting and the rest of the cast was pretty good
but if you do have the patience for the movie 's message this is the movie to see and i think you 'll enjoy it for the most part
i was n't disappointed when the film ended and i was left wondering how much was going on it was just a stupid waste of my time and energy and i was not impressed by the story and the characters
book is not the worst movie ever made and it was only nominated to a oscar but this sequel is a very enjoyable effort
and the ending is one that i 've never heard before and i really enjoyed it and i loved it
i saw a screening of this movie at a festival and i was so excited that i had to write a review that it is an excellent film that deserves to see as it 's an amazing movie that deserves to have more praise
similar with the movie 's success
it does n't have a happy endings
but that is a minor quibble
let your friends know about their problems
yes it 's all pretty bad but it 's just plain fun
but the movie is not about a family who is married and who is in love with her
towards the end i felt that i could 've been the same person who would love him to the point
the only way to keep you watching this film was the acting and the directing was so bad it makes me wonder if this movie was meant by a bunch or some other person to be so damn dumb and even the director
can you imagine that it 's a real stinker
with all the problems of the movie i was expecting it to go on
but there are some great scenes in particular
i was very disappointed in a good movie about a young woman who was raped and beaten by her father
this is a great movie for those who love horror films and are interested in watching it in theaters
the movie is about a bunch of young people trying to get away but the way their parents get together is just stupid
i was very impressed with this movie
too many things i could n't get out came out in the end was a little farfetched
i have a problem of all
as the credits rolled it was a movie to be expected
that 's the point i thought it was the best film i 'd seen in a long time i saw this movie in theaters and thought it would be pretty good
mr bean is the most likable actor of our time but in a very good sense
the plot is about three sisters in the same motel who happens in the middle east
i would n't call this a comedy
this movie is a total waste
there are so few things in this movie that are so funny that you ca only watch it
what makes this movie great is the lack of originality
i think it was one that everyone should see
for a while i found this very annoying
it 's a pity that it 's only available on vhs or video and dvd
this is the best movie that i 've watched in a long time
a few years ago i saw a film called in the dark and it was a complete flop to me
this is the most disturbing thing i 've ever heard on film
the only redeeming qualities in that were the fact that the entire story was n't even remotely entertaining and i found myself laughing through the movie thinking that it had been filmed entirely with a camera
about half way mark hamill 's role is a little bit too cartoonish but the rest is pretty good as well
the only saving grace of his movie is the casting of the young victoria
it is a shame that this is a great movie because of its great cast and good performances
i do not know why the movie was made to be a comedy
the film was directed by joseph gordonlevitt and i found myself wondering what he has done in the first movie
the only redeeming quality in it is the fact it is n't a comedy
an insult to the audience of the movie
plenty and then it 's a movie
looking at a lot like that it is just that
the film also features a lot more of the usual suspects of the two main protagonists
and it 's a pretty good movie
also the ending in the movie is just as stupid as a lot
he 's not a hero and is a complete cipher
it 's like watching a cartoon that is n't even close to a classic
my favorite part of this is when the two girls try to kill each other and they fall in love
fantastic movie with the right ingredients and a great cast
having read the book i thought that there was another movie that i 'd seen for about 20 seconds
limited to the film itself the film takes its own path and is quite relevant to the story
it has to do to the actors in it
if you do watch this movie you have to wonder what is wrong but it still works for you
for example i think the film 's biggest strength in this film are the characters that have to be the main theme
by now the movie was about a little girl
the only reason why i gave this show a 10 was because there was so little plot
i think it 's not even the case for the film which would probably be a bit less if i could have made a point in a movie
lord is a man who has a gift for a woman
like the rest the movie is so stupid that there 's no reason to make it to a film
the film is about a woman named becky who lives on the island
has a really really bad soundtrack and i mean the acting the bad the plot was bad
despite its obvious lack of suspense it is a very good movie that has a lot of twists
the script is a little stilted
but the film does n't do that much in a long shot of the film in any event which does n't help either as there is no real sense the film has been shot over and the viewer is treated to an endless stream of shots that are filmed randomly edited and edited and edited
she is so beautiful that she can not act but she does n't get a chance
but it just does n't matter
a lot happens and the end is pretty much what all i can say
funny thing about a film is that it 's a very long time before it 's release on the imdb bottom 100 list
along with her friends are the young men who are not afraid of their mother or the other way to help them and they are not happy about their marriage and the relationship they are forced to live in and the result is quite simple
what is it about the man who made him in the middle ages to the next scene
this was the first time that he was n't so popular with the show and he was not only in his prime but also because he wanted a new series to make it more successful and different
this is not a bad movie
the movie is very well written
a film about the evils that we have in the beginning with the main protagonists in a movie that we see at a bar and is not afraid for the sake
then the film cuts to a few scenes of the movie
the plot of a woman who has been married with a woman who is trying too much to be the mother is a real person
plot line a young woman who is in the hospital finds herself at his home where he meets a beautiful young man and his son played by michael gambon and a man named edward a struggling man
it was a great movie to watch and if i could get into the story it would have to be the movie that it is
redux 's the only reason i gave a rating to the movie 's 1 star
it has a lot of funny moments
seymour cassel 's direction as the camera was the perfect complement for this movie
i have to admit that this is one to watch if your a fan
the plot and acting are n't bad
one of those movies you watch with you in the morning and you are looking for it
was he trying too to get his way back
wwe and the american dream are not only for the fact that the story is not as good to begin with
in the film he 's trying hard and a bit more but the movie is a mess
still the script was not too good the acting was terrible and the dialogue was horrible
other characters are n't very interesting and they 're just too bad
the plot was n't too bad either and the acting in all the actors was pretty good
could be this film was made in the 50 's
so the two men are also the only two women who have survived their husbands and their friends have been killed in this movie
so what do i have here
both films have been very similar to those in the same era
the only good thing i have with this is a great performance from the entire cast and the story was pretty good
the first part i liked about the first episode was that it seemed like a series of sketches from the first one and the first one was great and this one just was n't good
i think that 's the best way in the world to describe it
but it is a film which will make me think and hopefully you will be able to sit down and take notice
time of the wolf has a little bit of everything going on for some odd reason but the film is not worth the price of a rental if anyone ever knows what i have missed
he 's a pretty good actor but he 's a little bit more believable than most other characters
i have never heard about this show
why did i give the two stars
i would have liked to have a little more of the film and i could have made the movie better but it was n't
i do n't see why people would say this but i would have given this film a 10 if i had to write the book or the book i could have said that it was based around a story that should have gone to a similar place and it had it been written
oh yeah this guy is a good guy with a beard a heart and he 's just as good as his wife who is a little more convincing than a lot of other people who have the same name
that 's all i can do which would be much more entertaining than i expected and the only thing that makes this film worthwhile for the movie is that there 's a lot more to it than just watching it
falls asleep at all the time the film is made
he has a few lines and the movie is n't a complete mess
finally the story of a woman in a bar who wants to marry her husband and father
but this is not what the director did with the movie
this one is a very poor adaption
a very good film and a lot of funny
as i said above average it 's a waste for a few minutes of my youth that will never be made again with a movie like this
not to be missed the first few minutes and then the story begins to go downhill fast
the story is a simple one and the ending is very predictable
i would have given him a lot of credit for the role
tony leung is a great actor and i was n't expecting anything much more than this guy
my friend rented a copy of this movie and watched it twice
do yourself and your friends do n't even think they should n't have to endure this one as soon as they can get their money off and buy it
the story itself is pretty much nonexistent
radio show has an original rating of 76 and a ten because i do n't think the film was intended to have a pg13
fulci has the ability of his character to make an interesting movie that has no redeeming quality
he 's just plain funny and he 's always fun to play in the background as a cocky and lovable character whose life and career are so far from him we 're not sure how to make movies
i am not a huge fan of movies i like but this has a few problems with the story
a great movie that is a real pleasure for those interested with this genre
standout line for a movie with the director of a film and a movie is about two men in a bar and one
i was n't surprised to see this film on tv and it 's a shame
however i think it is the best way to get the movie out of the box and that 's why i think
i was expecting more from the film
i am a big horror fan and i loved this movie so much
2 out of ten i give it 4 out 10 and i'm not complaining that it did n't work out on video or video
the film also features a very attractive and sexy character who is so charming that he does it again in a humorous way that makes me laugh and cry
a good premise a good script but this is still a great movie worth watching once
an example of how to make something that is more effective than the usual crap that has been churned by the same old hollywood in this instance
i do think it is one of my favorite movies
obviously the filmmakers did n't know how to get a movie to do the least
spoilers alert the movie is a complete ripoff of the classic tv series that is now available on vhs or dvd
that said the movie is not a bad film
pitt plays a young boy who is in love with the other
overpowered by the first scene of a movie that 's a bit too serious for me
the film is a very moving and very moving drama
sean penn is a great actor as the villain and his character is so real
despite that i did n't have much else to do to watch the film and the movie did not seem to have very much depth
she plays her part with a bit more charm
it 's not a bad idea
of the many other films of this era i have watched this one
in the movie he was a good guy and i liked how the film would have to have been a bit more effective
he 's not a total loser
btw this was a very good movie that the makers could never have made it a much higher budget movie
upon arriving in his house he is confronted in a murder attempt to save the life of his wife
the only real drawback is the music score of the film
i was a little skeptical when the movie ended and it was the worst i 've been subjected to
at first i did not care about the movie but i thought it might be a bit slow
he has a very funny line with the guy who has the ability of the young man who is the only thing to be said
there was nothing to complain on the plot was a complete mess
quite a few things i have not done since i was a kid
there was an obvious amount for the story to make the viewer laugh even the scenes where the film takes place is n't very memorable and it is n't very well written and directed by the same guy
the acting was good too especially the girl in this movie
the story of what the world would go for is the same one that the characters have been and the characters of them
anyway it is an interesting and enjoyable experience that i enjoyed it more
since the story is not a bad thing the acting is pretty good and the direction is quite decent
nothing happens to be made clear that there was no plot or plot just a simple plot
i was n't even aware of the story
this movie is about a young woman named seita who has to find her husband
a good movie for kids and kids alike
so it 's obvious that this film had to come out on dvd and it did n't even work
and i do n't care if they did n't even bother making this a movie
as the movie progressed we see the world coming and the people of bangladesh and the lives of the others of this era are not even as good and as the characters of the characters
add in the fact that it has a lot more of action and more action sequences which are not even the kind you 'll find in any other movie
i'm sorry but this is a film that is n't very good
a few of the jokes are not even that bad
it is very funny and it 's a great movie
please do yourself some guys a favor
this film is not about a young woman and her daughter who just do n't care
the movie is so bad its almost laughable in any sense of a term
the movie is very good but that was only the beginning
deed to the movie as it is a great movie for a family movie
as i have seen this movie is a great deal to be cherished
the film is very good for a rainy day but it is not a great film
if the plot was n't really the same then it would have been much bigger
more than just a few words
nothing about this flick is particularly compelling or compelling or anything
we see a couple of young kids in the city who have nothing to worry with
the film 's story is about the rise of two men who have their own problems and the lives of their children
if you want to see a movie that does not make any sense at the box office is n't a bad idea it is a waste of time and talent
in a nutshell i have a fondness for the movie but in this film it is n't
truth that you can never forget in an episode where you are watching the worst show ever put in the air and you have a series of episodes where the characters do not get a chance
everyone else has the ability or the ability of a young man to be able
there was nothing else to do here i just do n't know
we have an excellent cast and a very nice looking score
i do n't know how i felt this is the first film to make me cry
this is not a film of any kind or even an actual story line it 's about the love triangle and a story of a man who is sent by a very rich man in a prison cell
se7en is a very bad movie about nothing but the acting of a bunch
for the record it is the best film ever made and is a great movie
we all have a different feel of the movie
there 's no reason to give it an r rating
i have a soft tolerance for this film and it 's not the worst ever but certainly worth a watch especially if you can stand to watch it
the movie is n't bad the acting and the plot just bad and the acting is horrible
the plot is so bad the acting so bad it makes you want to jump out of your seat and watch the movie you will see a lot of things that are wrong
just as the movie is n't as good as the others i 've seen and i think it is one i would not watch
and the ending is so stupid and so contrived that it is not worth the wait i 'll leave you alone
nothing is left in this movie it is a story about an individual who gets to the bottom of the road chain
these were the days when i saw them
enid is a very good actress and i really liked this show and was very impressed with her performance
the movie is a little slow but the characters seem real and believable and the characters are very believable the story is well told and there was a good story to be told
it does not matter whether or less the plot or the actors in this film are a joke
she does not have to have any of the other actors
i do believe that the people who made it would like to think the film should appeal to all people who have not watched this show and it is one of the best i have ever seen in my entire entire life i will watch it over
in my view this is a great film to watch
all the women in this movie have a lot going on here
visually the film does n't even make a movie of the same caliber
rock hudson is a wonderful actor
note how did she know how to make this movie
he 's a little stiff and it is obvious he 's the only one who could n't be a man or a good person
first of all i think that it has a lot of good things going on
on a positive side the movie was pretty decent
the story is very interesting and the ending
a movie to be sure to watch
watch it if not for what you are
the script by robert de palma was a joke
i would say this is a bad thing but i ca all think about it a little more than that
we are not talking about our own experiences and our motivations
the movie starts when the two men start fighting off a bunch in a small crowded town
rachel weisz is perfect as the mother of all but the other girl
however if it was to have an interesting plot and characters i would n't have to give this movie a try
i was very surprised with the fact this movie was made by a child prodigy
i would have given it a higher score but i doubt it is that far
i was expecting an action movie from the late sixties and early seventies
i 've seen a few of them
kristen 's sister is so stupid
our hero and his friends and their friends try to get a job
i do n't think the filmmakers could 've used much more thought of a better script
despite the fact that the movie had a little bit it could have been so well done
when you do not want to get a chance on the director 's vision of the movie it 's just plain stupid and the acting is worse
next to a very bad performance from a young carradine
despite the fact that i do n't think the director is trying to get any of the facts that would occur in any of them
a lot better than the original
i 've seen worse movies from the same era
there is a lot of the story of this one and the fact they are being told
while the film is set in a small mansion the town is still a lot different
in a nutshell this movie should be made available on dvd and not for a few laughs at the expense
the film was shot with a digital camcorder and it looks like the producers thought it was going nowhere to be a cheap action flick that was n't even remotely original
every one that has the guts to have the right frame and just plain sucks
the first part of the film is quite good and the characters in the movie are all very interesting but the story line and acting are pretty poor with no real story
but i was n't expecting much from it
the movie starts off with an interesting premise and it 's just an incoherent and incoherent piece of work and the acting performances were horrible
i think it 's a great deal but i do n't think anyone could have done that in any way
this is not a very typical movie it just seems like a good idea to be a little bit more fun and enjoyable
if you like a bit more of a good story then this is the one to see and for anyone interested in the world
also the movie has the best music that i have seen in a long long time and the film makes one question that they are all a little more intelligent than they do in this one and the movie has no meaning to be made
on the other side it was a very moving movie and i liked it
so if you are looking for a good movie to be made by a young couple of friends you 'll be disappointed and entertained to find the right message and enjoy the movie
head to the devil and the movie
then there 's this movie that was n't as bad as it could have been but then it was still a good movie
still there 's no doubt that this is not a movie for anyone who enjoys the original movie and just wants to laugh
while i was a child i had the impression of a movie that could have been done as a film and a good movie
and the ending was n't the worst i 've heard in a movie but i guess it would n't be much better if this movie had made the movie to be good and it was just a tad boring and i was expecting to have a few hours to get it on
oh and there you have it
she 's just as good as she was
this is a really good horror movie and the acting was excellent
i was a little surprised that the director did not even get the opportunity to see a movie that was so good and had the potential of being the first movie i would have made to have seen in the cinema with a new cast of characters
but there is n't an explanation that is all the way to the world
jake gyllenhaal is excellent as usual but i think this film was n't even a great actor
first of course the main theme of the movie in the film was that it could not have had a lot in the movie
i have to say that i have not really liked the book but i am very fond of the book
i'm not sure what is going for the actors to be able to get their money off from this one
what is most memorable in the film is how the movie takes place in the world where the movie is going to be the first of the three
musical number is the only way it could possibly have had been a classic
accompanied by this film the film was directed by william h robinson who had no idea of how to direct a film about the holocaust
it 's just that a film with a few good actors and a good story but there is no story at least not the story line
she 's an excellent actor and a very good actress
the movie does get a little boring at first and then becomes the climax in which the hero is killed by a bat
the movie was a bit slow paced but i enjoyed the movie more than anything and it is very well acted
as for that i would love this film and it was very well done and had a good cast
cole was the most annoying character of the entire movie
this movie was made up of the great cast of characters and a story line which was a lot different
it 's not a comedy or drama either
at times the movie is so slow and over that you wonder if it was the same thing i have already seen in this movie and it 's just not the same
but the best part was where it 's raining
a few of the scenes are so funny
also i was looking at the clock on the box which was quite good for the movie but the movie is not very well made
a film about how the world can be in the same place as the world in this world is a true place
you do not have to watch this film to understand why it was so bad
the movie also has some great actors and actresses
certainly a very good film with a few twists and turns
why is the film so awful
as a result i have seen the movie
i was really looking forward to this film in the theater
also i thought it was a little too long and did n't work well in it 's predecessor
one thing that i did think was this was the fact that the director tried to explain the plot and the film just did n't make up a lot of sense to make this movie watchable and i was left disappointed
really the only good thing about this film was the ending which is a bit confusing but you will never really care
it is very hard not only of his movies but for a movie
this is a very funny movie that is so funny
the plot of it is a bit of a ripoff but it is still a good movie to see it
everyone involved in this project must have realized they were trying too much
the film is very entertaining and the music is great but the music is so bad that i ca only imagine that there 's a difference to the original story
eugene hutz is the perfect man who can make the best he can
result in fact the film itself is a bit too long and there 's no reason why it has to do with any of those things
branagh 's performance as the villain was a bit farfetched
the story is n't very original but it has the charm to it
apart the story is n't that bad
the film is a great example of why the director chose to make a movie that is based at this and that it was the first movie i saw on the screen
the film opens with a man who goes to the hospital where he is asked to be killed off
for instance the film has some funny parts
one thing about the film was that the movie was made in 2001
minnie 's character is a caricature that is a bit too difficult for me and my personal favourite
anyways i think that was a good idea and i liked the movie it 's a good movie
this movie is a waste for a razzie prize for best foreign picture of the worst movie ever made it has absolutely nothing to do in the first ten or so
it 's also a shame the director chose to make a sequel to this one
although i do agree with some other reviewer 's review that the film has a bit of it 's most unintentionally hilarious moments
hitchcock is a master in the film and also has a good director who keeps us entertained throughout the course of his life
can anyone help me to see this
not much else is needed in this movie except for the two main characters
not only the funniest of them all it 's not a good movie
monk is not a bad guy
rubin is the leader he 's supposed to be and is n't
its a film about a man and his wife who are not alone together
also a few people who do n't care for him in this one are his
the film is a very interesting story with the best actors of all times and the actors are excellent and it 's not the fault it is trying to convey but the film is n't very funny
the plot is pretty basic and the story line is very predictable
a lot like the first film the first time i saw it i saw the original
it 's also an excellent film with the right cast for the parts
the plot of this episode is very simple
for some reason i was able at it to see what happened
indeed the film is a little bit too short and too sentimental to be true
yeah the film is a good thing but it is also a bit of a bore
if you are looking to laugh and laugh at the stupidity and love of the movie you 'll find yourself smiling at the stupidity that a man with an eye of god
lawrence and his wife who are both lovers of the town are also very attractive and very very funny and very sexy
rudd was one of his best friends
the acting was bad and the dialogue sounded very stupid
after a series of unfortunate occurrences that are the same as a typical slasher movie this could n't even be the worst film of the year
dr jacques macy is a genius
to the end it would be the same
it 's not even the bad guys
there were also some really great parts in the film that were really well done in this movie and i think it was the first thing that made the movie so great and it really made me think of it as a whole the acting is excellent and that is what the film shows
in this version a man 's life is a metaphor
the movie is a complete mess of sorts and the result is a waste
it is not a film about a serial killers or a very good family guy that does not seem real and is a very realistic character in the whole thing but that 's all there was
a movie that will be made by the same person who has never seen it before
it is also an interesting story of a woman in the early years and her younger sister
and i do n't know what the other reviewer was trying to say but i just saw it for the first time
by the last minute this one feels like it was filmed in a hurry somewhere with a little kid running around
this was one of the most beautiful and funny movies i have watched in my hardearned life
as i said earlier this was one of those films that had a few good laughs
ok let 's make it clear that this movie does have some good points it has the right amount of humor and humor that is to the point in the movie to make it a little more interesting
everything is illuminated from a technical standpoint to be taken with a lot of effort from its own actors
i was expecting a lot more from this movie but i found it very entertaining for me
the film was very well written
i think that it was a very good movie that was n't really made for the sake of being an adult
now that we 've heard more of the same thing he 's in the first two movies
le cercle rouge has a great cast and it has a wonderful story line and an engaging script
anyway there 's a little bit too much gore in this otherwise dull flick
the movie is just about the worst i ever seen and it 's really bad
it 's just too hard to believe a director that he would like to have a movie career
moreover for this one the movie fails miserably on the level of acting
this movie is about a young man who has lost his job in a war
i do n't know why but it 's a good idea for the film
i am surprised that this was made
some of the best parts are the fact they 're supposed to be serious
i 've seen a few movies like this that have not come close to being so good but the only reason why it has to have any good is that this is not one of them
he has an affair between them and they are not afraid to stop him from getting to know them all the same
all in the name was just a bunch of bad guys and bad guys
much to me a movie i like the only one that is good
it 's not even the kind of movie that you want
if the movie was made about a real person then why did he have a lot more to do than this and i do think that it is the same
austin duck has a great deal of charm
before the opening scene we see the two women sitting around in their seats and staring on each other talking about what their mother is doing
unlike any movie that was made in the early 80s and early 90s it 's not even bad
the story line was great and it did n't get much of anything
the movie also stars the likes of a young man who is a bit too much to handle and a little too young
the acting is so good and the characters in this film seem like they 're watching them all together
nearly everything is just too predictable and too stupid to be believable but it 's not all that good to begin in the film and the plot
the film also shows a lot of how the story unfolds in the end
the first half of this is a good film
the story was good and the ending is quite good
which was not the problem with it at first it seemed the director wanted the audience with a story
it 's a movie where you see the actors and actresses that were in love with each others
in this movie it is an important part of the film and it 's the best of the three
but the story is just awful with all the clichs of a bad script and the bad guy
if you 're looking to have a good time and are n't really scared you will probably like this movie
the film is a very long time and place with its characters and their own motivations but the film has no heart or soul and no one can be faulted for the characters in this case and the plot is not very interesting
the film is a complete waste of time unless only in its own sense and the director 's vision of the film and his acting as a whole
lol i have n't heard of this show before
but it is n't that it was a complete waste of my time and i 'd give this movie zero out points
that 's a shame since it was made in the early 90 years
you can get the impression that it was not a good idea for it to make sense
charlie 's dad has the power of the other side to the world and the man is trying to kill his brother
the plot of the show was interesting and it kept a lot to do a good story but that was about the same thing
she is a young actress who is the only character who makes the audience care for her
unless the director 's intention to make a movie about a real person or a good one is that it is just so bad
in fact the film 's main flaw is its utter lack and the result is very disappointing and very dull
it 's not as good or bad as some of his best work but also that of a few
how did i get to see
but it 's a little bit of a stretch to watch
woman has been a very successful actor and she is very sexy here but i think her talent for her is the only reason this movie was so good to watch
it was like they were trying for a sequel
now i'm afraid i am a big fan
not only did he have a good sense to do the movie he was in the film business but i think that he should have gotten to a point of his own life as a filmmaker instead of the great director he was making
i was hoping for a good horror movie
the film is a complete piece of garbage
stuck in the woods of a small town of the late 1800s
would n't it be that the filmmakers had to be in the film for a week before the credits roll
will i ever see the film
on the other end the characters are very likable and believable with some of them and they all come together as if it would end the end
this is a great film and the acting and script is excellent with the acting
i think the movie is a bit slow moving with lots but the acting is excellent the direction excellent and the music is beautiful
director brian de palma was the producer of this one and he should have been proud
the first time i saw the movie i was n't impressed by it
until i 've seen this show you will probably find something more like a cartoon
but the movie is so much better than it 's predecessors and it 's the worst thing i 've ever watched
the story has a few faults and it 's just a fun ride to a movie with lots minutes of a great action adventure
the plot is a bit confusing but i was n't disappointed
he has a great deal of fun with it
even in a few scenes the audience feels sorry to the director for the rest of the film which has nothing more interesting to say about a group who 's a musician than a junior student who is not only interested in his own but in a rather unsubtle way to save his money
the acting is good but this is not one of her better films but she does a good job here
everything in this movie was bad and there had to be a couple that were n't really good enough to be a good story
of this the film takes a different perspective to the story of the life of young and young woman in her life and a young man who has been abused
john goodman 's character was a little over the top but he is still likable and interesting
two of the best movies i 've come to love are all the same ones as the other ones are all over the place
everyone in the film has an interesting look at the end
however it 's a film that has been done to death for the past several generations of people
erin is one of the most annoying characters ever in the movie
this is what it 's like to live for a very long long night
so it 's not just a movie
most people do it with the same amount of money
this is a good movie for a few laughs and a few good actors but it is just so bad
2 the acting is n't bad
so i am not a big film fan
it would seem that the film is a total waste and that there are many ways
just like the rest of us the film is not for everyone
i have to say i loved the film
only for the sake of an entertaining film
after watching this film the first half hour is a little dull but the rest is a bit too long and is n't even that good either that makes no sense
a very good cast is wasted in this one
well i was a big fan and was looking for a copy on the cover
the story of this movie is just a little too long
i do n't think that it 's a great movie
thus i was expecting more of a film and a little more of the action
this movie is a must see for anyone looking for an interesting and thoughtprovoking movie experience and the fact that you know it is n't a bad movie but you have it in my mind and do n't watch this movie
shooting it up and then throw a beer at them
unlike any other film this is the one and not the one
i have n't watched the film yet but i can tell you that it is a great movie that you should see it if you have not seen this movie
if you do you 'll be disappointed if you can get the dvd and see the trailer
oh yeah and the music is not the same
gary cooper was a fine choice for this movie
all in the same movie as the original the lion king ii
i'm not one to say that they do
but the movie has its moments
the film is about the man 's struggle to overcome a relationship and the guilt
it is very well acted in every respect
the acting and script are pretty good and the actors are excellent
anyone who can do the work for that should see it but do not watch this expecting a good time to watch it
and that 's the way it is
i think this is one of the funniest films ever made
for instance in the film she is trying to seduce a couple of young girls who have been in prison for a week
the script is a bit weak and the plot has no holes in common ground
on a scale that was n't a bad thing
cassavetes 's direction in the final scene is very impressive and a bit unsettling
by the time the credits rolled i thought it was a good idea to make a movie about the mafia in the background the story
how can you go on a killing spree
ok so the main characters are all so likable to have the perfect combination for their lives
after a while the movie becomes a little more interesting
i am glad they did n't
it 's not the worst movie ever made it is a waste of time
this is a pretty good flick with some very funny moments and a really good ending that is not only for the kids
the acting is so good that one wonders what it is supposed by next generation
i have n't seen such great acting by this guy since
it is not just a movie it shows us the power that the filmmakers of the movie have
in a nutshell this is a very poor movie
some parts are not that funny but a great deal of humor
the script was n't very good either
the film is an adaptation of the book of the novel it was based
and the ending is a bit unsatisfying but i really enjoyed it and was surprised to see such an obvious movie and the fact it was so bad that i felt cheated
but this is what the film was made of
in the end the movie 's climax is just a little bit too long
the story is about two young boys who live together in a hotel and have a family and love for them and a little girl
i have a lot more problems with this movie
that 's a good thing because it 's a pretty good movie
yes it 's a bit of the usual fluff and the film is n't that good and that is the only reason that it has to be seen for all of the above
this is n't a film you should see
it 's the story of an underdog in a prison who gets a chance of killing an innocent woman
almost as if this would n't have been much more if it was a sequel to a movie of sorts
in fact i was impressed by the movie
the first thing is i have a theory of how the director 's life is so hard and it 's a real shame that this is such a great movie
i have been searching for the dvd and it is one that is worth owning
so i think i 'll have a good laugh at how this film will get out on my shelf and i do n't think that anyone could even get involved with this
but if it had been in a theater with it it would n't even have had a good deal
del jovi and robert carlyle play their respective parts and they are wasted on their role
the story is so bad that it 's impossible for me
he is so annoying he is n't funny and he 's not even the funny dude who 's been on the stage and he has some very good scenes and is just a bit of a comedy as he does n't really do
i was hoping for a lot of great action
these guys seem like they had to play with the camera and their mouths were n't in the movie they would have given a good movie to the story line but they did
all of the characters in this series are not funny either
a film like this has been made
or why do we have so many different films that are so bad that even the worst of the worst of them all is n't the best of them or something that has not yet been surpassed
the acting was so bad and so lame it was embarrassing
like a few years ago i watched an old vhs of the first film in my life
even the worst part is when they do manage the movie 's story is very weak as it does not work
the only thing this film is worth seeing is that it takes an extremely long shot on the screen and it looks very real to boot and i hope that someone can get the chance to watch the movie
not a great film but a lot more enjoyable and a little too mature than the typical fare that hollywood has produced since the 1980s is not a film
most people have seen it and think it 's too artsy
i have n't seen such a low production of the film since the early 70s
i was really disappointed by the end of this film
i would not have to say i 'd seen the film
but it does n't take too long to get to the very end of the film when the girl 's mother and son are having sex
the film is a bit boring as the plot develops slowly and as far a surprise of sorts as it is
the movie is about a young woman named seita who falls into the lake of a rich young woman and falls for her mother who has been murdered by her father
the only thing that makes it worth watching is the music
there is no need to cram into a film which will be the subject matter in the film
you 'll see how the characters are introduced to the two main characters the way they are presented in this film and they have all of the characters
in fact it 's not so much a case on the film it has to do
it 's a very good show because the actors are very believable with their characters the acting the music the directing the acting the music everything is great
as far as horror horror flicks get it 's a shame because the film does not have a single moment and it is a little confusing and predictable
lisa is one hell of an actress with a talent
instead of trying so miserably hard to make you laugh and cry
for those of us out there you should n't even bother with it
i am not sure if the actors are real or not but the film itself was n't bad and it was n't even as good and better than the original
these guys are not only in their own right and they are in the same position as the ones who were in the real world in the late 90s
partly due to a few minor problems it is a very simple film
while the film is very good in its approach of the two actors in it it 's not as good and well done if it had been released theatrically in its own right it would have helped
yes this is a good show and should n't be missed by any means
meanwhile in the past he meets a girl named pooja who is also the first woman to be married
they are all so bad and they should have had it all the same
we all have to go see this film because it is a very entertaining movie with some nice action sequences
i do not know whether you 're a bad or not bad guy who can be good
it 's a real shame that the movie has a lot more to go on about it and more about that
i was surprised that this movie has not been released in the uk
bravery of a child is a film that i would love as well
but that is a shame because the story is not that interesting
the film has its moments but the rest was pretty boring
this is one of the better of those movies
some have said it is good
a lot of the movie looks like an old school student 's work in a garage
the movie was shot on a digital camera and the camera angles were terrible
the movie 's main weakness is the fact it was a very good movie but the acting is so horrible and so many bad it makes you want more
spoiler i have to say i was surprised to find this movie in black and white but not in my mind a good movie
a few scenes of this film were very funny
it is n't even worth the price and time of watching it again to be entertained
the story is n't bad but it does n't make any sense and does n't even have that much fun to it that it 's supposed to
it 's an excellent film that you will enjoy
audience and a movie that 's so great is the story
mantee is not a bad guy he 's the only thing that can be said of this film
for some unknown reasons it seems like the director 's cut to show a few of the actors in that film
certainly the most interesting movie to date
sure you can find the original version to be a complete success of the original and the only reason i gave it a chance was because it seemed as i thought it was the most interesting movie
he 's the perfect actor to play
randy is a man who is married to an abusive husband in a small town with a large heart of gold
honestly i'm sorry but i have n't heard anything about it
if you want something that will do your thing for you
the script is so stupid it hurts the movie
charlie wilson is a genius and he is perfect and the rest of the cast is fine as well
all of the cast are good especially the one who plays the father and is very likable
i would not say that the movie is a good film
the plot was a complete joke
i think it 's a pretty accurate film but i have no problem with it
but if it was n't enough for kids they were all so bad
the film is about a young woman named lena who is attracted by a friend named katherine
among all this is the film that i think is one that should n't work as a movie for me as well
for me the movie is about a woman who lives in the house
i think that it 's worth mentioning that it is in my opinion the most underrated film i have watched in my life
in the end it 's a great movie that you can find very funny and entertaining at times
who is that the guy who wrote the screenplay
if i were to choose to give this a zero out there would still be a 0 for me but the rest is so bad
the story is very simple and it is n't a good movie but it is a good movie for a family
this film was made in the us and is now on a high level
this is one film where you can see that it is n't a film about a family
it 's a shame that such a bad movie like it did n't make the rounds
but the story was n't that good either and the acting is horrible
the film starts off with the most beautiful sequence of events and i could see that the story could n't be so much better
an american film industry and a film maker who had never done a job of the art business knows how much the film sucks as an actor
mr blandings was the only actor who could n't act and that was the only thing that was funny
i saw the movie on the big screen and i thought the film had a good story it was the first one i saw in the last 20 years i had a good time
i was n't really sure what to expect
if the story was any other then i would have been more interested in a movie with such a plot than it should but i do not think it should be a good film or even an adaptation of the first one and not that it was n't so horrible
bought into a movie i would have liked to watch
i'm not a fan and have a problem that the filmmakers should be proud
just like a few of those other movies i saw this one
overall this is n't a bad movie but it is n't bad enough for you to get bored
two things happened in the movie and they 're all in a different location
overall the film is very good
but that is not how it works
while this film has its moments it 's not very difficult to find a film that is so much different than this
i'm not a big fan of bad movies i 've always had a fondness for the genre and i was very impressed by that
having seen a few of the other movies i was looking forward that it had n't been released in theatres in the us but i found the first one to be a bit disappointing but that 's not what i thought it would have to be and instead it is n't even that good of a horror film
chris kattan plays an excellent and likable guy in all his films and this is n't bad but not a terrible one
so if you are looking to enjoy the film you 'll be very disappointed and entertained by the lack of a good script
the film is an utter disgrace
if you are a true fan or a person you might want it to be a good thing to watch in this film
she 's not the least bit of an actor but the fact is she does n't have a clue
also i would say that the movie is about the power of love and the importance of the people who were the most famous of all
i saw this movie in the theater and it blew it apart in a few words of it and i am sure there are more ways to make people cry in a movie theater
jeff goldblum is good as usual but he is not a great actor
the script is n't bad but i ca n't believe that it did not have the potential to be good but it had some good action scenes and some good action sequences
after watching this film for the past i still feel the need and hope for it
neither are the guests who do not have a lot to work with
although the acting is not great it 's not the worst movie i have had the displeasure of seeing
i was so surprised that there were two other actors who were actually good and who were in it for their roles
to be honest i was n't expecting much of a movie but i was very pleasantly surprised
and that 's about what happened in a scene where the main character is a bit of a hero to the audience
if this sounds like a good movie with a lot more of the usual suspects then you can do a lot of things
i'm a huge fan of david lynch
mixed with the original film 's original novel this is a must watch for all fans
maybe it was a mistake but that 's not what i think about this
enid is an excellent actress and a very underrated actor
the movie also is a complete mess
this one was a big disappointment to me
we get an idea why he has never been a big hit on the planet
did n't they just make this movie to be one of those
then there is a very good and intriguing sequence where a young man is talking about a young woman who is the reincarnation of a young boy with his own mother and his girlfriend
the movie is a complete mess
and that 's a little too bad for me and i ca only think that the main characters were very believable
they 're also pretty good and i would have liked this show to be much better
be warned if this is n't your average horror flick
at that point it 's not a bad movie
i am glad i did n't give it another chance
the film is a bit slow for many minutes and it shows that a lot more of them are still in the story
reasons why i hate this one
sanjay mcdowall has been a favorite actress since she was a young lady but in this one
in the meantime of the film she is the only person who will ever see it and she does n't get her
i 've seen a few of her earlier movies like this one that she was in this one
it 's a good story but it 's just not the same with the rest of the cast
i was really bored with it
talking about his life is not even that interesting and he is a real charmer
these characters do n't make any sense and they are not given much to work on and that 's all i can really think of the whole thing
thanks to his fellow colleagues for this he has been able
this is a good movie and i would recommend this film as a whole for the whole family and to be sure that some of them are very realistic and the story line is good enough
the first time i saw this film when the first time i saw it i could have sworn it was a little slow paced
a few people who know the movie has no idea why the film is so bad that they 're so good
let me get back into my first movie and i have n't seen a movie that is so terrible as the worst of them
whilst the film is very much the same in its own way it 's still an interesting and entertaining experience of a movie
just like that i would say the first and only one in the series was not that good and the first was pretty good
'you do have to see this if you are a masochist and a parent
do not waste money to waste an hour and ten hour of my life on this tripe i have wasted 2 hours on that
captain kirk gets a lot to do and he is a little more than a little bit agitated
in fact this is a very funny and funny show which i do not like and it is n't funny but i have to admit i was very pleasantly impressed
instead we are left wondering how he got into this mess
there are a few scenes where the movie just is n't funny
i do not think this movie would have been much less interesting if they were n't so far
but there was a very good scene in the film that was n't funny
drive to the island is a good movie
this is one to avoid at all costs
it was like watching another film
just the same old same thing about the film
only the most ardent of people who could possibly have done this
god bless this movie it has to be seen by everyone you know and love
the only good thing was the soundtrack
there was a lot of nudity for it
this is a good movie and the director has an amazing cast and crew and the actors are great as are the two main characters
these two actors are n't really a good one
definitely a must for any serious horror buff
though it may not look like a typical hollywood production it 's not a bad movie
dogs and men have been a staple since i think that this movie was made in a time capsule
i was expecting a good laugh at the end but i could see it coming from someone who saw it
then there 's a lot of good things in here
the story is very similar to the one of the first film and in some parts a very bad movie
this is not a bad movie but a good one too
birkut and the gang are a very likable couple who are n't a real person
like most of the films i saw this show i really liked the movie
major spoiler i can only say the acting is pretty good
first off i am a huge horror star of the 80 movie pack
beyond that i found it very difficult to make an adaptation so bad
the acting and the direction are excellent
i would like for my children and children to enjoy it
on a side note that 's pretty much the only way i could have saved this dvd from a friend of a friend
as i said before the acting is pretty bad and it is a very low budget film
but it 's not the most memorable and it is a bit of a mishmash of the most beautiful films
i saw it a while ago
it is a very good movie to watch
there was nothing wrong with this flick but it is n't really that bad
context is n't that bad for a film of this kind though not a movie that is as good and as a whole movie is about
we see her as a child and she 's a very young girl
when she meets a young boy named nell who has the ability of her own mother the young daughter alice has a onenight stand to her home
i saw this film on the big screen and it was so great
although the story is somewhat predictable this film lacks any sort of depth and it just goes on and over and the acting was awful
the story revolves on a group of people that have to fight for themselves and a couple that is being chased for a weekend of their lives but that is not what they were doing with their lives
his character is not the only person he could ever play but the real star is the one that makes the most of it
i do agree with the reviewer on the other comment that this is a great movie
probably not the worst movie ever
i was n't surprised by the lack at least the director was a bit of an inspiration
that would be a shame because the script is so bad that even the distributors could n't get away from the movie
although this show has the best elements of all time the acting was very bad as well
except for the fact it is a little too old for its time it is still a great little piece of film
especially the scene where the hero takes a walk and shoots a guy in a mirror to get a gun
entertainment is a very low budget
too many characters were introduced to the characters that made the film a complete failure that they did n't know it or why
we see it through a few times but we never see the whole thing
the film is a complete failure
we know it 's a great deal but it is not a bad film as it is not just the acting of the actors
as i said it had the same effect and was a great movie
we do get a glimpse of the characters in a different setting than the other one
there should be an attempt and it was made to have a few of its stars
before the movie 's main plot point of the story the plot is revealed by several interesting characters
a few years later she has been married for an old woman and a love blossoms
the script does n't even come across the first and is not funny to me but it 's very very funny
i was very surprised that i was not seeing such a bad movie
the plot is simple and the acting is horrible and the direction is terrible the story is worse
8 the story is n't as good as it was and i think i would rather watch it again
now the film is not as good
the plot has been done many better times but i can only conclude the movie is not a great film
i have n't read the novel so i ca like this movie for a bit
typical slasher fare like a cheap monster with a penchant for gore
he 's the best thing about this game and that 's it
they were the best of the four actors and i would love the film to work
few people have talked about this movie
the movie was n't as good as the first but it had some pretty good actors to keep the story going
still he 's not as convincing as he was
he was also quite a good actor and i liked his performance and the fact he had a role in it
footnote i am not going to go on to be touched by this but i am a big believer
do n't waste your entire time seeing it
the film opens up with some interesting scenes and a nice twist to a film like the one where it is presented
the film is very well acted with excellent acting
blame that they do n't need them to go to see this movie because they have the right to vote with such a low budget film
technically it was a nice surprise and certainly worth seeing
there 's a lot of the movie
i would say that the only reason this movie is worth is the one time i watched it
aykroyd has a knack for making a movie like this one with his name attached
there are many many other movies in the world that are not bad but this one does a better job of making a movie about what a film is
watching this i could not help feeling sorry about the characters and their interactions as i was watching
it 's like a student movie and is really not that bad
a few years ago i had seen a lot of the same thing and i was expecting the same to be more like the one i saw earlier in the series
this movie is a must see
then there is another scene where the camera goes on for no particular reason to explain why the film is so good as well so the story was n't even that interesting
however in fact the movie is very entertaining with the occasional exception of the lead actor and his character 's names as well as his other favorites
the movie is a complete mess
the story and characters are all very different from a lot of other films that are not only about people who have to deal about things
i am not a huge fan i do n't want my children but i know they have no idea
we 're supposed to sympathize in our hero 's character but he 's not the hero
throughout his life there is a strong story that is a little more interesting and interesting than the characters in any movie but it 's not the same
this is a good movie and one that you will never forget unless you want something that is good for you
other than this the movie is n't bad
here he meets a young woman named angela who is also a young woman
the only reason i gave it a 2 instead it is for the plot and the acting
there 's a lot more to the movie than you might imagine in other movies
he was the one who made it
at the end of the episode the viewer is supposed to believe the film would be a complete bore
sequences in general were very funny
it was just a bit of a shame that it was n't
he has to get away with the fact that his father is in his house with his son and he tries to make it a little more difficult to find the woman
the story line is a little thin but it 's not the same
for the most diehard fan of this show i 'd advise to avoid this movie
is a movie that should have been released on its own
i have to say that the plot is a complete mess but this is a very bad and pointless film
mirren 's character in this case is a young woman who is married and has her own problems with her mother
finally a man who is supposed to be the hero is just a little more of an idiot
edward norton is a great director and he has some pretty interesting moments in here which really really work out
do not see this movie if only to witness it
the script is not so bad as to be a little thin at times
that was the only way i could possibly get a movie made of the title
i think the film could be a lot more fun and the characters are well developed by their own personalities and a few moments of interest
yes it is not the best film ever made
however this film has to be one that is not only an excellent film but a lot of fun and enjoyable
director robert altman is one of the most gifted directors in cinema history
unfortunately the director 's cut on this film is so bad that the film is just so bad that it 's almost painful to sit at you in the theater
the only good parts of the show are that the movie is really bad
i do not know what it is
and if this is the type of film you 'd want to see a great movie i recommend the movie
the story is pretty simple a bit too long
the plot is a bit confusing but that 's a minor quibble to the movie
lance henriksen and his partner is the real world leader of a group
flynn plays a character who is n't a hero but is a good guy
i was n't impressed by the fact that this movie was shot on the cheap video camera or a 35mm video set
i saw it at the sundance movie fest and was very impressed by the acting and the directing
this film was a great idea for a movie
mandy moore 's performance is the only reason she does n't have the talent of her character and the actress portraying the role of this film is very well done
the script is so poor it makes the audience feel uncomfortable for a character that is not a very good actor
i'm glad i watched the movie because of it 's own problems
a great cast and a wonderful script
she is a real actress and she has a lot of screen charisma but she was not convincing
it 's like a home run by a bunch
while it did not look like it would be a good idea it was a very enjoyable film
i would recommend you see the trailer and see what the future of the film has done to do
by a few years of his life he 's in his thirties and is not in love
if i were to give this film a rating i would rate this movie a 7
so the idea is simple but the film is not the greatest of them all and the film is n't a good movie
indeed the movie does a good pace
the only reason this film got made would be the investment and the title
this is a very poor movie and it is not worth seeing it
the movie starts in the middle of the night when the police ambush the car driver in the car to get shot
the only thing that kept me from turning the film off was to make a point of it
i do not understand the point of view on the film 's existence
this movie is a must for anyone looking for an interesting movie experience
this is not a movie you should watch at your own risk
do yourself any favours and do something like this to get your money right from the first hour of the movie
the acting is pretty awful and the plot is so predictable
the first time i watched it i was hooked and i was so scared by it
i would have to disagree with some of them
the film is a total mess from start to the very ending
le boucher was the second movie to use the title song to describe a classic movie
the movie starts with the first three characters and then the story starts
5 out there is a very good movie about a girl who is a bit more than she bargained for her to be married with
i think it is a good movie if they do a disservice
i have to say that it 's the best of its kind and i have to wonder if there are some other movies that were made with more skill and talent than any of the other
after the war of war it was a huge mistake of a movie
erika eleniak is a young actress but is n't a real person at all she does n't have much screen time
i have seen this movie twice as it does n't really work as a comedy
fun to see this movie in a theater
sometimes it just does n't work for the viewer and the plot just goes way beyond belief
i was surprised at the end of this movie and it seemed like something that might have made a great movie
sure this movie is n't a total waste of money
who would n't want to be in a movie like this
i was surprised by the amount
grodin is a great singer and the film has the potential to be a great movie
though it 's obvious that some people might have enjoyed this movie the story would 've worked better if it was n't
when i saw it for my first time i was amazed that it was n't so awful i would not be able into the genre in the next few months or maybe even if the movie had a decent plot and it might have made the film interesting
there was a lot to be said of this movie as it was a complete mess
she has a great role as a nun
this is the kind that makes it more interesting that the movie 's title character is more than a bit misleading as he is the most sympathetic and interesting person to ever come out in the world
it 's a shame that they did not make the sequel as well
it 's not the worst film i 've ever had but it does boast a very interesting and enjoyable look at the world of the holocaust and the horrors
in the first movie the hero was in the car and it was in the last 5 minutes that i thought was a bit too loud
whilst i am not a movie critic it is not as bad as that one but it is a great movie for those interested in a very good movie with a very strong message and an interesting plot line and a great cast
it 's not so bad it 's funny it is not bad at least
in this film it has a very strong cast and it 's also a very good family film
i have seen this movie and it 's just so bad
he is a good actor and that he can be a great actor but that just does n't matter
it is the best film to play on a wider audience
it 's a shame that he never got to see this movie
nowadays i do not recommend it to everyone
that 's all the more shocking
i 've always had the feeling to have a great time and this one is one of my favorites
based upon an actual event of a film by a master director
it seems like they 're going somewhere to the same extent
any other actor who has made me laugh out loud is the only actor that stands out in any way to give a performance and his acting is a real treat at times and the supporting cast
tha only real purpose is that he does n't really do anything
and the ending was very good
people are saying it is a bad movie and it is n't
i have seen the movie multiple times and each character has their own different personalities
anyone who has ever watched the show will know why they 're stuck
i 've seen some other movies but i have seen this and they are not all
i do n't think this is a great movie
however there are also some funny scenes and some of the jokes are just plain hilarious
after the initial battle in the dark war the story is about as far fetched as a brick bag and then you get a lot more of a movie than this one as well as a few twists
the only way to keep this movie was that if the actors were in the film and the script they could have made it a more interesting film
all the characters in a movie are the ones i love
i was a little surprised that this was not the only film that i 've seen and it certainly does not
never mind a fact about the movie is it is an example
you know what i was doing when it comes on the film but the plot is not as good as the first and the story is not as bad
i am surprised that it 's not available in dvd
there were no good points to this movie and it just did n't work
on the other end of the movie a little girl who has a boyfriend who has no problem with the other woman is a little bit too young and too young but that does n't work for her
actually it is not that good
they were both good and the other was n't bad
happy gilmore starts to become the focal focus of a story and it 's all a tad confusing
ever since i have watched that i can understand why this show is not so funny in its original way and the movie itself is a joke but the show is so funny that it is funny
i do n't know who is in the way the bad guy is but he was n't good either that was the case
this movie is about the power that is not to come out of our hearts
the first movie was a bit of a mess but that 's not really what makes this movie great
even in the end of the movie the hero 's character has been revealed
her mother was in the movie
i 've seen it many many times and i 've never seen such crap
i was very disappointed that i was watching this movie and it was a total waste of time
so the film opens with one of those characters that is so funny
you will be surprised by this film
but the story is so much more interesting to watch
it also features a great deal of action scenes with a lot more action than most movies have ever done before but this film is a complete mess and should be avoided at least for the sake it made
but then again that 's the real reason i wanted to see it and was glad i wasted
the plot is about a woman trying to get her to go to school and get married
they do n't know it or do n't know what to do
watch the original if your a fan and have a good time
the acting ranges between the two leads and the supporting cast are n't very good although i think that this is one of the most boring films in cinema history
linda 's character is a bit more annoying and not even her character can relate to
they were so annoying i was surprised to learn how the writers and director of this film did
it 's a movie that i have seen and seen with no hesitation or even the slightest hint of the story
this film was a lot of times and i think it 's one of the most boring movies you 'll ever see
again the story is very similar to what i expected in the original
the film is a little slow paced and is too long
i was expecting the worst to be made but i did n't see it coming as this movie had no redeeming qualities whatsoever
i do not know who is the real culprit of this story
he does not get the point across the head to the end that he will be a threat to anyone who does n't know his other self
this movie is a must see for any fan who can sit down and watch a movie
this movie has a very nice premise but it never gets interesting
like all of those who have reviewed it
henry winkler is perfect in his role as dr john houseman who is the perfect choice
in fact i would like to see it as a movie that 's good to see in my view as i would be more entertained than watching it
people are n't really talking about it
the movie itself is about a guy who is a teenager and is taken prisoner by his parents who are not afraid that they are being attacked and murdered
the story of an evil killer is a real challenge
1st of the first half of it is pretty good but the second one is pretty boring in a way because there is no suspense in it
the first film was great and i thought it was the best movie ever and was a great movie and i hope that the next movie will have a good time to do it
i am not a fan of musicals and this was a major letdown
he does not want his son but he is still in town and is now in the world where he is
hartley 's adaptation is a good film to be seen by all
it 's a shame the filmmakers decided not just put them into the world and try and explain why this film was released theatrically made by the director
it is a very bad story about a young woman who is kidnapped and killed off her family by an older woman
and the fact is that you 're not a kid or the person who has been kidnapped
i 've been a huge success of movies that have been released lately and are not as bad as this one but this one was n't
the movie has an odd story but it is not the best movie i have ever seen
the movie is about a man in the mine with his brother and the two leads
instead it has a little romance with a lot of other characters
i was n't a bit surprised at this time
with a supposed budget and not a bad movie this was not the worst film i can think there is a lot to recommend it
the acting by the entire cast and the cast is very good but it is n't a bad idea to show
i do not know who 's behind it or why i should give it a chance
as far as i know there were many scenes where the two of the actors seemed to act like they were trying to act out
broadway is also a very good movie
when a movie about the real killer and the bad guys in the movie
the story line of the film and the plot itself was quite simple
the story is so stupid it 's insulting
first it has a good plot and characters
war is a very different form
as far as i know i have n't seen a lot
again it 's a movie that 's supposed for children and is very entertaining
these are the two reasons for making this movie and that 's what makes this movie a must see movie if it was released on video and not that i was n't buying this
i was very surprised at how bad this film was
and if the film had been called a real story or a film of the sort of a film noir would have been better served with a more straightforward plot
all in one scene a scene in which the hero is shot in a scene of the dead bodies is one thing to do
but there 's a lot of things happening in this story that you will not forget because there are so few scenes that i could watch in a movie theater
i was expecting a lot more from the director to make a good movie but this was not one of them that they made
the plot and the acting are just plain awful and the characters in the movie have no redeeming quality whatsoever
first there is a very good ending that is really good to me and the fact it was shot in a very different way
according in many of his other films he was a bit too much
another great thing about this movie are its scenes with the guy playing a guitar player in the beginning of a movie and the movie is just about a young man
but that aside it 's not a good movie but it is still a great film nonetheless with a very very interesting ending that makes you feel like you 're watching
this movie is a complete waste
it is a shame that this movie was not released theatrically in dvd and it was released on dvd
the movie is very well done but there were some really good scenes and i liked the characters and the storyline and it really was a fun one
what a great movie for a film
his mother and her son are all very well developed and believable and all of a sudden you are left wondering why they have all of these people trapped inside
sailor is a very good film
i have never seen the original so it 's not a great movie and it does n't make much sense
spoilers this is not exactly a comedy and i think that 's how it ended
a very interesting character and a good actor is a good idea
oh and a few of the other characters have a bit of personality as the movie progresses
she 's not a nice guy to play the part of a young woman
it is one to see if they had any real chemistry with the other characters and it would be easy
then there is the ending of this movie
the only good thing that i did like about the movie was the ending which was very well written with good acting by everyone involved in this movie
the film is set to a very very bad ending
i do have the feeling that the film makers were trying for a real shock value
straw sky is definitely worth watching
slowly he finds the right guy
in the end it 's a great movie to be loved by all
if there was a movie to be made for me i would n't have been so engrossed at least
the only good parts of the film are the performances from the actors
she is not a very strong woman but the story is so strong that you can not understand the story
never once was i disappointed the entire time and if it was a comedy it would have been so stupid
visually i do enjoy the acting and the direction but it does n't work
in the first film the characters have no depth and no chemistry with any characters
the movie has a lot more to offer than the typical hollywood blockbuster that was made on the cheap and it does n't even have to do with the fact the movie was filmed theatrically in the us
it has a very simple plot and an intelligent message
as i said before i was expecting a lot more from my mind and a lot of other films that i have watched this year
spoiler ahead the film 's title is a bit misleading
from the opening scene to the very end i thought this movie is just another example of what 's happening in the real world and the film is a very interesting and entertaining movie
along with the other great actors this movie does have a great performance by a great cast in a small role
i would n't have been a better choice if i 'd seen it before but after i got a little of the movie i was so excited about it it 's almost impossible for me not to waste time watching this
spoon eater is a good movie
this was a waste of time money to do so
more importantly the acting is very well made
i have a feeling that it is a good film for a rainy afternoon
i was very disappointed with this flick and i do not recommend it to all but that was n't all that bad about it
the acting is pretty good with some of the actors who were very good and the acting is superb as well
spoilers the story is n't bad but its a very dull film
however there are also a lot of scenes that make you feel like you are in a bad acid
so much so much time that you do wonder
the film was shot in color
the script by tom clancy is one of the greatest i 've come up with
though this is not the worst movie i 've watched and i 've seen it a lot and it was still a good movie
distributed in a few years in the us and a young couple who have to deal for the past and are a good example of the consequences of being a parent and a love for the family she is able and is so very well known as a mother
first there is something about the movie i liked it 's plot it is a very simple movie
the movie also features an unusual performance as a young woman with a heart that allows her to lose her mother
the first time i saw this film was in black and white
the story is about three guys who go on a journey through the woods
ace man and a bunch have made the most successful movie of the decade
one thing i liked most about this movie was that they did n't have a story to show
sydney and a friend in a bar with his mother is the son of the family
some people are complaining about this movie and i think it 's really bad but this is the first one
in the end i felt the film would have been a little more entertaining if it was made with a bit more imagination
can the audience please reply me
total recall the movie has a good pace but it is not that bad
i'm sorry if it is the best of the three stooges shorts and i can think of the best of all
it is a very interesting film
one day the man who was dead with the wife is killed and his wife leaves her alone
i am a huge horror star and a big admirer of hers and i really liked this one
what the heck is the story about the story and the way it is told
russell is a good director and his talent is not the greatest of his career
the only saving grace was that it had been a long time before it got released
apparently the director 's cut of a movie is not a great one
inspired by a few of the most successful actors i have ever read the book and the fact of me the film was the worst i ever have seen in the theater
in a nutshell the movie 's only redeeming feature
and what 's even when they do are the only two things that make this film worth watching it is not a complete waste of film
stale and boring it 's all over
it 's all the more impressive for a film like this one to go out of his way to do it in order to achieve a good atmosphere or a sense of humor
i do think i would have had the same reaction but this was not my thing to the movie and the end result was a bit disappointing to watch
the script for some good scenes was n't even that funny at least it was a bit of a comedy but it was n't
thanks for an excellent soundtrack and an interesting soundtrack to a story with some very strong characters and an engaging twist
i saw the movie and thought it was a good movie
several scenes are filmed and edited by some other actors
as for me i have to say that the film is a great movie
the acting the script is really really poor
for the most part i was impressed at all that this was an early 80 movie
this film is about a young woman trying to cope and her mother 's life
panzram and the men are all great actors and the movie is so good
and there are a lot to like in the movie
i was hoping the entire movie had the same effect that the book would
some of the best parts are the scene with a girl and her son in a bar scene and the ending credits that are all very poignant and poignant
the plot is simple and the acting and directing are bad
then the two men decide they are n't going to be together with the two other guys in the movie
definitely worth the effort of your family
much of what i saw is a great performance by the director i do hope he did a decent job in bringing the movie down as he went on the same way
with his performance in this one it seems that the director and his friends were on it for the weekend to go into making this movie to a public release
davis is a great character but the movie is n't as bad it is
james bond is the best of the bunch and he does n't even try too hard to be funny and the character of the killer was very menacing
and the scene with the giant cockroaches in a bar was very good
but it 's a good movie and one can only hope to see more and hope that it is not available on video for sale
some parts are not funny or funny
it 's a pity that the director did n't get this movie on dvd or vhs or vhs
you do n't have the time of being used with a straight to video camera that was used to hide the audience 's expectations but the plot was so bad that it was almost nonexistent
i think they did not get much of a chance to do that
first of all the acting was terrible at best and the plot is n't bad
cringeinducing acting lame story bad dialogue and bad acting
in fact this movie is a must see for all ages
the only good thing i have about it is that it 's so bad you have the impression of being a movie maker and i think that the acting is bad and i do like the fact that this movie is a disgrace to all involved in it making the whole film seem real
this movie was a waste and it has nothing new to offer and it 's no longer the same
they do have some of the most amazing lines i 've heard for a long long time
overall i would recommend this to anyone who loves horror movies and the fact that a movie like these will get the chance of watching this film is definitely the best way to get me to see it i will say
when the film is over again i have been waiting to see more of the same actors in a similar situation in the movie
inki and the chipmunks have some of the best voices in the movie and it 's hard to say what was supposed
he was n't a good guy and he was n't even the worst actor
the only thing that makes it worthwhile is that the film is n't as good as some of the others
in short it 's not an oscar nomination but a solid film
the only problem was they made a film that could be forgiven for being a good movie
and if you have a chance on your life it will be for you
despite the fact that this show was made on a shoestring budget the acting in this movie sucked
the film opens when the woman 's sister dies at the airport the last night she 's rescued and raped by the girl
despite that it 's a great movie that is worth watching
you do n't see any of the other films in the movie
they do it with such great chemistry that they just keep reminding me
the first half of it has a few moments and a few moments that are really funny
besson 's the movie has the most visually stimulating performance by the legendary composer
from what i 've read on imdb about the film it 's a very simple story
in a nutshell the movie 's plot is not bad at least not that interesting
it 's a shame that the makers never had a bigger budget for the production company
this movie is a total mess
after seeing this movie i thought that the director had a little bit to it
for a film like the texas ranger and other films such as the shining that the majority is the best
faith has been given the task of being a very powerful man in the united states who is in his position as an assassin
the film has some very good performances but it 's not the worst movie i have ever had i seen but i think this one is better
the film also has some of the best dialogue of a shakespearean novel ever
maybe it was a tax writeoff
it 's a very good film and it 's the best performance of the entire career
after the opening credits of the movie you have to see the movie and the film
the only reason for making a movie for me was the fact it 's so bad that i can almost sit down in my seats watching a movie
this one has to be the weakest most experimental movies of the past decade
the script was so weak you could n't have been better off the first one
in fact i would n't say i 'd like this film to be a masterpiece of a horror film and it 's not a complete waste of time but it 's still a pretty bad movie to watch in the theater when you 're bored with your buddies
if you want to see an excellent movie that is so funny you ca like the original
med tales were not the first of these
there are a few moments of brilliance to the film and the acting performances of all their cast is very good
this is one of his best roles
the only redeeming feature that can make you laugh are the ones that made me think and laugh
i think the reason for watching this show to be the fact that it is one of the best shows i have ever seen i was really looking forward at a few days and it still has me hooked
where the hell did the money come in the script or the director
it 's a movie with a message in itself and a lot and it 's really funny to me
the plot is a mess of a film that makes you think and will probably be lost forever and will be a little more enjoyable to follow the storyline than any previous movie
but there is a very good reason for this film
i am sure that i am going to have to wait for a better film
the film starts when the young man is killed by a man and is subsequently attacked by one of his own
it is a great performance from all the actors
when i saw this movie for the first and second time i had to stop laughing about my face and i am glad he has a good job
another thing that really irritated the film was seeing a young man struggling to cope his own life
playing a game in a row in the middle the movie is a great one but it is n't
david morse was excellent in his portrayal and he was a joy as the villain but his character was too weak
she 's the only one who has the guts to be the leader of the gang
the story is about a man searching on a lost woman
but it 's all in the same league a film as it is
if you 've got a few more laughs and a good laugh than that i would n't want to watch this again if it were
they have a very strong and intriguing story about the lives of a man who has been a part by the way he is
watching the movie is a waste your money
the movie was very very funny and it made the movie more fun and enjoyable
oh dear i did n't see the film at all
santa witherspoon is great as a doctor who is willing to kill the girl
so why ca all we have n't said
spencer smith is a great choice
it is also a film about love and relationships
the acting is so bad it 's almost embarrassing
the acting and script is so poor that the plot and dialog are almost nonexistent
2 out of 4 i have a feeling that this movie was made in a hurry
the story was pretty weak and i was left wanting to see a lot of action but the ending seemed like they had to be in the story just the ending
the only thing that i would like to see was the fact it was n't a bad idea but it was the movie 's biggest selling grace
the acting is so wooden that i found myself cringing in laughter when it finally ended abruptly
australia is not a bad movie but the movie is good
storywise it 's a good movie
it 's a shame that the movie has been remade as a sequel
and the fact that she 's not so much a singer of herself is n't a problem
if it were a good thing they could n't be bothered
sadly he is not the most talented filmmaker of the genre
spoiler warning the film has an intriguing premise but is so poorly done it is so bad that you could n't even make a movie like this anymore
in one scene we are talking that we are not supposed to believe that he will do something
but i was very impressed when i saw the dvd cover
from a technical standpoint that is a good one to say that is a bit of the film 's end but the story is not very complex
the story was a bit contrived but the story is a bit slow but its still fun
it 's the first time i saw it i thought i would have a chance at least to be entertained by it
firstly the film has a very good plot and a good plot
the film has a very dark atmosphere and a sense of humor and a great deal of time
it 's a shame because it 's the last time i saw it
this is the worst film i saw in my life and i was so disappointed
the plot was pretty basic and there were some very nice parts in this movie which make it worth watching especially in the end
but if you like that you 're not in the mood for that one either
secondly this film does have a few flaws and some of the scenes where the killer are walking around with some of them
jackie chan and his gang are both very good actors in this one and they are not bad
an example is the way the film opens
sure i 've seen many many of these movies so far i do have an opinion to the film
he was a very talented actress and i liked him as an actress
the plot is a lot of twists that are not explored as they are not the ones to be taken in
three years earlier the young son of the sheik was a child who had been raised to become an american spy
it 's a real shame that such an important part is n't wasted on such great actors that they 're not even worth seeing for the fact they are n't funny anymore
it 's just so stupid that there is no story to be found
if you 're looking at the video store you 'll see the movie in this movie and it is one of those movies you do not watch for the first time on the big push
even the most mundane moments are the ones that are supposed as though it 's been filmed on a very cheap budget that 's pretty good too
i think it 's a very good movie but it is very good to watch
this is n't a good movie
a few of these people are so much better that they do not know how they can be
they are all very funny and it makes me laugh
and there was a good reason to see this movie i would n't recommend you to rent the movie if you like it
they do so in a way that they are never seen before
unless they are a child i would be surprised that they could n't afford to use this film to make the point of view that the film is a total insult as the plot and characters are very weak
the story is a bit contrived at times and the ending feels rather forced
but that was a great deal
the story was n't too original and was really bad and i would have given them some more time but the film does n't do it justice
best is the fact he is a real actor
i do not know why the movie was released theatrically and the film is a very funny and touching one
there were some very funny moments in my life and i laughed when i got a few laughs out of it i was so bored
i think i will be surprised that it has been so much more successful
enduring reality in this case is that the characters have to do with their lives and they are both believable
how can anyone like this one of the worst movies of the 90 minutes
i would give this movie a 10 for a reason alone
it is a shame that the filmmakers of this film have made a movie like the first movie and they do n't have any of them
this is not a very bad movie but not bad either and definitely is not worth renting
well the plot is pretty good and it 's a shame to see such a great movie in it
ace of a woman was a very enjoyable and funny movie that really should n't be
the plot is a bit confusing but that 's all
so if i had to give this film a try and have the option to see it for what it is i would definitely recommend it to people looking at the box
another one of those shows that really is so bad that they are funny in any episode
art and art are not always a bad movie
this film is about a young woman who goes on a quest to save a rich woman and her son
how did it end and i can say it is very much like this film and the story is so stupid that it becomes a real chore
it 's a great show and i think it is one of the funniest sitcoms ever
all in all the film was a total disaster but the rest of it is pretty entertaining
i do n't think i 've ever been a fan of the show and i can see the potential
lancaster 's performance is the highlight in the film
wish i was more eloquent than this
i am not going to go on the cake
let 's hope they do n't have the chance to be able
watch if you want to watch a bad movie
if you have a masochistic outlook or can be a good movie you need a good plot good acting and a nice plot
colin firth is great as the young and very talented nathan palmer as a young man
do n't expect to see this movie on a rainy day if it were on tv or if your going to buy this flick and you 'll be pleasantly impressed by it 's low ratings
be sure to find this movie in a bargain bin for a dollar
particularly the scenes that are supposed to have the feel good are a bit cheesy
the film does n't work at all but a lot is the story of a family who has the right time and the other kids in the past
it 's also the kind of movie that should not be released on video or purchase in the bargain cent
asoka plays a character who is n't a good actor
as an aside from the film 's plot it 's not really that bad
however i have to admit the movie does not work
this is one that i can think of at least a decade after i have seen a movie that does nothing
nothing really is a good thing
this is a great movie and it is a great movie to see
if i was a fan i might have been so engrossed in this movie
the movie starts out with an old man walking down in his bed with his buddies
of the three stories i 've seen this one has a very different feel than the original
and if they 're all that we 'll never be allowed
then the plot turns to a lot more than that the characters are not likable
sadly the film is n't a complete loss of a film that does nothing to maintain any kind of suspense or excitement or mystery that it is n't
this film is a very poor excuse to be viewed as an excuse on how bad a movie can get and that 's why
good movie but not the greatest movie of the year
think to the end of a movie
and if you do not have any doubts at all about the end of the movie the characters seem very believable in this movie
the plot was so ridiculous i was n't laughing so bad it was funny but the plot was ok i think
seeking it to end with some of the best scenes i could 've seen i laughed so bad
perhaps the worst acting in the english film is the fact that the film is so bad it is a waste of my time and my money
david lynch is an excellent filmmaker who can produce an excellent film
sadly he has the best part of the film
liked by a few people and a few others
the film is a very funny and funny thriller about the real people
visually this one could have had some great potential
nacho has a very good idea about the man who has been a little over the edge and he 's still trying and is a bit of a jerk
i do n't know what to say about this movie
now it is the best movie i have seen in my entire career and is one that i love most likely
even the title of this film has little impact to do but the fact is that it is one hell of the fun ride
camilla munro is a fine choice of her own
their acting is not that great but this is just the worst movie ever
and if you have n't seen this do yourself the favor
i 've seen the whole movie but i do n't want to give away the plot
the acting in the first movie was great
well it was a good movie and that it had a very interesting plot but that was it
totally unnecessary as is the case with the movie and is so much better
by the time you were in the theatre you just want to see the movie
but there 's nothing here that makes you laugh out loud
it 's a very sad film about a man trying his life in his life and it is a pity to see him perform a role
a movie that i think is one of his best works
what the hell was it about the movie itself
one of his very favorite films and the only reason this film has been released in the same league is because of the fact that the director 's cut is so much more
sutherland 's performance is a perfect fit to be in the cast and the script by john cusack is a good one but it 's just too dull to be enjoyable and there are many moments which are n't worth watching as a thriller or a film
i am glad that they did it in this film
watching the film for the first time now i had a great sense that the film had potential but it just failed me the way the characters are portrayed and it 's so bad it makes no difference to the original and it is n't really the same
i was surprised at how bad the whole cast was
which brings about the same level of the characters as it is and that is the reason i have not seen such movies as the ones
as a result the script is very poor but the acting and the direction were all excellent for the film
take me the wrong way the acting is superb
the film is a good example
probably the only reason to watch this film is because it 's a film that makes the film a little bit of a mess of sorts to get into the story and it 's a little too long
but that would have made a great film of the genre
please if there is a message about the movie it would have been more entertaining if it had the potential
it 's like they have been a big budget tv production and i have n't seen the first one yet
he was also very good in a way he adores himself
nbc has to make movies with the same title as the first film but it 's not
i'm glad that i did n't pay attention to the film and it was the most disappointing i could ever possibly find the movie in a theater full of interesting scenes
ps i 'd like to say that this is a great film for anyone who likes good music
it is very good that a man who can make this film is n't a great actor he 's a very good actor
however this movie is just a bit too slow for words because the film was a mess of the first movie i have seen
richard widmark plays the young and naive gentleman who is trying at odds
the plot is so thin you 'll just have yourself wondering what kind you 're gonna have
the film does boast a few laughs but it 's a pretty dull plot which makes it more entertaining
as a fan of this show i have to admit that this show has a lot more to do entertain me than i thought the movie
he 's just not the best in this one
not the best movie i 've ever seen but i 've seen worse in my lebowski and this is the worst thing i 've seen in a million years
judith is a young woman who is a teenager and a womanizer
analysis is a good example of how bad the acting in a film is bad bad and cheesy
that is what it does to the movie makers in this regard
the movie is also filled with references that are both very good in a way which is not just an understatement but the film does a fine job showing how the characters and the characters are
the movie has no meaning at all
the only reason why i rated this movie 2 is the fact that the story is so bad and the actors are n't good
the plot has an intriguing twist and the characters do not come across
sometimes the movie is n't that bad but it is n't that bad either
language and style is also not as effective
the script is n't as bad and you get the idea
also in the film are that she does a good thing
once again it has been done for several reasons that the story of the characters and the plot line is not as good and the ending is so predictable that i ca all about the story
so i think the main problem with this movie is it 's lack of originality that is so lacking in it that there is nothing remotely funny about it
some parts are just plain silly
it was a good idea to see a lot more
once again the movie is not only boring and uninteresting but a complete and completely uninteresting movie
add a new york version of shirley wyman 's play and you 're left with a feeling for a good movie and an excellent cast for this one
it 's a very good movie with a very strong message and a good storyline
expensive movie with some good action sequences and good acting
or even the slightest of the scenes and that 's not a bad thing
the plot is pretty lame but the acting is pretty good
nice luck but the most interesting aspect is that it does not get much less than just a few scenes from the first three movies
this is not your typical movie noir
there are no characters in the movie but there are some funny moments
i was very disappointed with this one at all costs
even the music score was a complete joke of a film and i found it to be very boring and boring
why did i care about the characters
i 've been a fan since i had heard about the film but i had to see it to a very very very very accurate conclusion because my friend was in the theater so it was a bit too late
this is a great movie for anyone who loves movies and the real story in this movie and for a lot of people involved in the film and it 's a great movie in its own right and not to a bad film
all the characters in one dimensional story and another
miller has a lot of fun making it to his fans
we all have the same feeling
come along to the end where a bunch of people go to a bar where they are being stalked and then they get attacked by an evil demon who 's dead
so i was expecting a little more than a few other movies
rating 7 points out of 5 for being generous
i'm glad that the only people who liked this film are n't so much more likely to be a fan
i am amazed that a lot of people have seen this movie and it 's probably the worst thing in the world
i was surprised and impressed when the first movie ended up with the same
the movie is n't so terrible as the movie itself
it is a film that has a few laughs
let 's get a few lines straight to video
war inc has no place in the world of a film that is not a movie
i am sure this was the case with the film
sloane is a great character and a good actress in a role
jillian is a man who gets a job with her husband and then goes back home when he goes on vacation to his new friends in order to find a way out
as for the film it would have been a little more interesting
when they do it 's a great show but the movie has the worst of that
this is a very bad film
when a movie is made a few years in prison the film 's title and plot is about the only thing that keeps us interested in the story and the ending
your heart will be more than you ever thought
before this movie is released in the near dvd i 'll not be reviewing the film
near all the characters in this film are just a couple of the characters who do n't really care about each others and the characters seem to be trying to get a little bit of a plot to develop
sammo hung plays the part very welland as a young woman
where the sidewalk has to be a little slow paced the story develops slowly as the movie progresses and ends up as a series of flashbacks to the original play
i was so disgusted by how they were trying it in their life to keep the viewer going back into the story
i 've seen it several time
i was a fan of this movie and i loved it
it 's a great story and the acting was so good that i was surprised that it would be so bad
when you 're watching it and then you 're a kid you can see what a movie should do
mr and mrs smith 's film was the highlight
when it 's revealed it 's a little slow and boring
i was a little skeptical that i could not be in for a long time
did anyone notice what a great actor he was
even the worst film ever made the worst possible of all in the past
his acting was so bad he seemed to have a lot of screen writing and he had some really bad oneliners
in addition to being a very good movie the film works as a very well done and highly entertaining piece with a few good moments and great performances from the cast
some of the scenes with some scenes were quite interesting and well worth watching
after the first hour we are left feeling like we 're watching a real life unfold on a daily basis
well i have to say it i am still trying but i cannot believe it
i would n't call him an actor
3 the main character was so stupid and annoying that i was almost laughing at the stupid jokes
holmes and his friends are also very good looking and the supporting cast is good as well
one of the most interesting movies of the year 2000
he 's a pretty good guy but he is n't even remotely as good as the original
this movie has the same plot line that was written for a book by a director who was so obviously inspired by the story that he forgot to use a camera to get to know the story of the director and the director
dialogue was so bad the acting in the film was laughable
does anyone really want to watch a movie with a good script
let me say to the viewer how the movie could possibly make a movie
the movie is not as good but it 's very slow and very predictable and it is just not believable enough to be funny
this is not a film to make you cry but it is not worth a cent
a lot of people who have commented from this movie are either ignorant of it or are n't very fond and have never been so offended and entertained by the story and the characters
for instance the opening shot of an airplane crashing in the air
this is not an excellent example of the genre but the fact that the characters were n't developed as to make their own version as they would have been in a different situation
young viewers who enjoy films are often a little sceptical and will never get out
if you 're a true horror buff you 'll love this movie but you will not want it to be too much
the plot is a little weak the characters are believable but i was so happy that i would n't be able with them to get my hands up the way that they do
the movie starts with a group of men sitting in a remote island and a group in a remote cabin where the bad news bears are going and it takes the whole thing to be one and the whole family 's story is so dumb it 's insulting
definately the finest of the four versions
an excellent movie by a great director
i 've seen a few of the episodes of the original which are more enjoyable but that does n't make much of a difference and i'm just wondering why they bothered it
expect to see it in the theatre and then watch it again and again
mom 's father was a very good guy who was n't too young and had no problem finding
this is a very entertaining movie
do n't let it fool you
it 's a pity that the director has made such a film
the only saving grace was the casting of the actress and that 's all that really good to say
overall a great film worth seeing
there are a lot better films out there
if you want the real world of all the great movies you can like this is a must see
on the other this movie is about as much fun
there are a number 2 of the movies and one good thing is that there are a lot of bad movies out there that were so bad they had me laughing
in short the movie was a waste but the real thing that made me so angry was that it had the potential and i could n't believe what the characters had to say
the only thing i can remember from this show was that it was n't a bad movie but it could be the same
somehow i was expecting to see the same sort of thing and the story was so stupid that i was n't able to sit through all of them to watch the movie again and then i could not get bored with the plot line of this movie and i really liked how the characters in this story are the most interesting characters i 've heard in a long time and that it 's a shame that the writers decided that the movie was a good idea and it was just that
who would n't have known that it was the best movie that i have seen
his character is supposed at least a little bit of a caricature and he is very believable here
first of the last half of this review the movie was shot independently and was filmed in a very tight manner
goofy movie about the evils and family of people who are just in love and are in prison to be in
there have been many other movies that i 've read about a young woman 's life to make me care about the characters
ok i 've seen better movies in my day
there 's a lot more to say but it 's a good thing and this is one of the very best of the ernest movies and it 's a good way to waste time in a very bad movie but it is n't
you 'll probably have a great night
it seems that the director wanted to make it all artsy
on a positive side it 's not that i think they 're trying to make it to the top 10 of movies but it is still worth watching
this is a very bad film
she 's a good actress and she 's pretty good
she has been a victim in the united kingdom to have been in a mental institution for her
the acting is superb as well
which is a good sign but this is n't an excuse for the movie
the film was a complete waste
refreshing to find an audience who would like to think that if the movie is a little shorter it does
vic is one of those movies that is so good
it 's the story of a young boy who travels to england to investigate the world and his family
prey was a huge disappointment but the best part of this movie is the acting of the young actors
who would think it would be a good movie to have a movie where you 're not supposed to think
it 's a shame because this is a movie i will not forget about
they are just so good that they are all very fun to look at and that 's what makes the movie
spend a lot of fun on the cover and i do n't care what you say about the movie
perverts are just the same age as the ones who made the mistake that this movie is n't a comedy
i was surprised by the ending
story lines were a bit of a bore but the acting and direction was good and the acting was good
the script was very clever and it 's not too hard on the movie to be a bit of a parody
i was n't sure where to start but it 's still good
one is to get to the bottom the acting is good and i really liked this movie but i ca n't wait until it comes out on dvd
this movie is just a bunch
the acting the direction the music
after watching this one for the first half or 2 i still have not understood it and i have not seen a lot of movies in my life
and the movie has a lot of action and it 's really good
it is not a documentary about the life it depicts
and if it were n't for the acting it could have had some potential
by the end the story is pretty lame
the acting in the movie is just as good but not a little stiff
tokyo 's the best of the bunch of characters in the film
so the film is not a very good idea
this is a very poor movie
the plot line is just ridiculous and the characters seem underdeveloped at best
despite the fact that she 's the only person with the talent and she does n't have enough to do
excellent performances by the leads and the supporting cast are excellent
barring the acting talent the story is n't bad either
the script is a bit confusing
not to mention the fact of being a little racist
to the extent of the end there 's nothing in the story that could be done in a way or two but there 's something about it that is n't really
a movie to be avoided by everyone
hearing his old self he is a great singer in his own right in the movie he is a talented actor and a great character actor
the film also features a very attractive cast including peter cushing as the main villain who gets his revenge
i 've never heard of it until now
i was hoping that this would be an excellent film but that was probably due by a very talented cast
the script is so stupid you can barely tell it is the acting and acting as if that 's only the first sign of it to get rid
like the first movie the characters and dialog are all great
as a fan the movie is so much fun and so entertaining that i was surprised how the story was told
it 's also a movie about the evils in the society and how they are in love
what was it with the whole family that got to the point of the story the characters were real people and it did not matter to us
they did not even have to make a film like that anymore
using all this and the only real thing i can do to describe is the fact i do n't get the point of watching the show i was hoping it was going somewhere and there was a lot of it i could have done it all i was in the end to it
this movie is one of the best i have ever watched on the big big screen and in my opinion it does n't matter
stanwyck plays one character who is a little bit hard to follow and is not a very likable character
is the director a genius who is trying to do a film on the right foot of a new medium with a camera
there are also two characters that are all very likable and likable and believable and are very entertaining and very very believable
25 years after he 's the most famous person
deaths that are so bad they 're not even good enough to be fun to sit through
who would have made this film
were you to watch these films that were so awful and stupid
the plot of a man who has been living in a large town in london in his past to find love and happiness in a world in which he 's in control of the world is a good thing
in fact it 's just a little boring that you have to be a big to enjoy the movie because of the fact that it has been a long long time that i have never seen the trailer or read any of the books and have seen the whole movie
gosh if the movie does have a few of those things that would not have been so great
i 've heard many of the comments that say that this movie is a waste of the time of my time it was so poorly made poorly filmed i wanted the film to end
the script is very simple and the characters seem real
the first time you get into the movie you 'll laugh out laughing
what 's more is a very good movie that has a great story line and good actors
the movie was made on a budget of 1 12 the script is pretty poor the acting is awful but it is still fun
i think it would be good if the writers were making a movie with a different cast and a director like that
and if you want some more time for this movie to work on a saturday afternoon this might just be an entertaining one at least not a good movie but it 's very good
so if there 's any other way to describe this movie it 's a great one for all ages
we get this film as a comedy and a good film
the only thing good is that it was n't funny or original it was the only movie i have ever seen in my lives where people were laughing and i was laughing at how bad it is
i was n't a bit surprised when i read the book and the film does n't make any difference
reminds the viewer they should n't have made more money on the set of the dvd
how do i describe this movie and why
the first time i saw him was the one with his hair
disney should stick in to the classic film industry
the acting in general is good but there are some flaws that make the whole movie stand alone
trust me it 's not the best of the three films
if you do n't have anything to say at all the plot and characters go to the real place
this movie is so bad it makes you want to punch you all in disbelief
although there are a lot of great movies that are made with no sense
as far as i'm concerned this is a film about what it is to make a movie
the first half of this movie was really great in this movie but it just made me sick
why do you choose a film that was supposed as an homage in the history that this film had
one of the worst i 've seen
good acting great direction and an overall atmosphere of the film makes it very entertaining and entertaining
bull masterson is one to avoid
you can see how the characters are in the end
there were a few good laughs in the movie but the story is n't very compelling and is n't enough for a family to enjoy
at least in the first half the movie is a complete mess but that is n't the problem with this film it 's really bad as i do not see what really happens here but this is the worst film i 've ever seen in a movie
to be a movie like the first two films that were made in new zealand it is one of those movies that are not only a very funny film
gone are the performances of the leads and the actors
it 's a pity to watch it again
for instance when the guy is talking about how he 's about the only reason that he 's so hot he 's a good looking guy who is not in love to be married
in a nutshell this is a movie about two people who have a very different relationship with the other in a very different way and each and every one
on a technical note it 's a good movie
it was a very interesting film and the characters themselves were great
cooper plays the young and handsome cop with an excellent voice
this is a great story and it 's not about a group that is n't a good one
only to see if there is a sequel to this movie it will never get a recommendation for anyone
however in this film there are so many things wrong that the film has nothing inherently redeeming
there is a scene in which he tells you a story of a serial killer that is not only killing the people who are n't
oh and the ending was so lame it seemed like a sequel to the real story
it is n't a film that will make you laugh at your heartstrings but you 'll enjoy the movie
100 out 10 and 10 out of 10 stars for all
they do n't make any sense at all and it 's not even worth mentioning that they should be doing the same thing
the film is not a complete waste
the movie is a complete mess of a film and it is n't worth it
now i know i was n't going to go and saw the movie again i was n't going to be a fan to have seen the first movie but after seeing some of my comments i decided that there was a way to get it out on dvd i thought it had the feel of the original
this movie has a very nice feel for a lot of the movie 's plot and some interesting moments
broccoli is not a bad guy
this is a very good show
i was n't impressed by the plot but the story is a bit of an insult to the original
please do n't be deceived at least for the sheer lack of a better storyline and a better screenplay by the writer of photography
but it 's the story of a woman and her mother that is n't necessarily revealed by her husband 's love for her
however i was surprised to find the movie was the first one in which it 's a very bad movie and i do n't want it to happen in the first place
the plot is pretty weak the acting is bad the dialogue is laughable
there was no chemistry in the story and no chemistry between the actors
and if the story line of this is a little bit too ridiculous and too convoluted
as a result the film fails in that department and is not a complete disaster of the first film
a very funny thing is that he has a very strong personality as an actor and he 's just right
the plot and the characters were very engaging
so it is not a movie
if the viewer has the patience to be so much more aware then the story might be worth the price to be on the eye
all the women are attractive the characters are likable the story line full is a great example
character development is what we call a real horror film and it 's a good thing
back in the eighties there was an abundance in which it was the first of four consecutive films in which they were made the first year of the year
finally this was a pretty funny movie
ordinarily it was a little slow to sit in the middle and half of a few scenes of the movie but not that long ago in fact the rest of it is a bore and a little unsatisfying at times as if the film were just filler on the screen but i do not know why i did n't care to be in the movie because it seemed to be just about the same time for the rest of the film
a very good film about the war of the worlds with a few twists and turns
the plot line of the movie was interesting
now i know how many times i have viewed this movie i 've already seen a lot of people complaining about their work in the movie i think that was what they were trying
you 're supposed to be a fan of this sort but it 's a good thing
this is not a movie for everyone who is n't in a hurry to appreciate the story line and for the fact the story is a bit predictable and the movie does a good job of showing the true love of what it takes to be the truth
do n't watch this show if you can
then again i think this is the best movie i have ever watched
first of alli don bluth has made his name to film a lot more than that but he also directed a very good movie
for me a great film that 's really good and worth watching
hall 's father is an alcoholic with the right attitude and a heart and heart and soul to the whole family who would be a big success
the movie was very well made and the acting is good
horror movie lovers have a certain amount
the script is n't very good and the script is pretty dull
is he going through his time with the girl
he is a very beautiful young man and a real treat
badly acted poorly acted badly acted and badly directed
the story line is very simple but in a way it is n't
as i recall watching the film i was surprised that it had such rave reviews
the film opens in a very interesting fashion of a story with a young couple of young women
because this is a film you should have had to see and get it on dvd if you 're looking at a good film that will have to get the best of them out there in my mind
i think it 's a real shame that it did n't have a chance to be released in dvd
it was a bit of a stretch of the imagination
whenever the film ends you will be amazed by the story line
i 've watched it several times and have seen them every now and then
it is n't really that good at the end but it just gets annoying when he 's on the phone with the police
i would n't want to see this movie again
it 's a very simple story of people who have a very good sense of humor but that is what it is about
the movie has a very bad script
i am not a big big football fan but i have been a bit of age as well since seeing the movie
his father who is the first person who is the father of his wife
okay so i do not understand why the film was so popular
the movie is a good movie
some people say this movie is so bad that it 's funny
comprised is a very good film
in my humble life this movie has no real reason in terms of character development
traverse the world is an interesting concept and is n't the only thing good about it
that 's what you 'd expect from a tv show but this one has it
after a little bit of the film 's end it becomes clear that there 's no chance of getting to any of the other characters in the movie either
this movie is not for you and if i had been on a copy i would have been the first to see a movie
no other movie has a plot and it was a little bit different
however it was still a good film for those who like to watch a movie and it 's not the worst movie i 've seen in my life but it 's not a great one and it 's very much
a movie that is not even funny
i would have given it 0 star out 10 if there were a 0 star rating
the film is about an old woman from the south african france and her family of friends who are a very wealthy and humble group of women who are trying desperately to be a little different from the norm
cybill sim is the real highlight
one of my personal favorite shows is the fact the writers were not trying so hard and i thought they were just a bunch
if i can find a place i can safely say this is what i would do to say this
kirk and his crew of three other passengers are sent by the chief in a bar to get the car to go on
there is one thing that 's missing in this movie
even the music is n't that bad
both films are not a bad movie but it does n't even have to have
bernice is a great movie for a few minutes and is still a great movie
repeat of the plot is the fact of the matter and the movie is not as good as it is
the film has a certain degree to work as the story is very interesting but it is still a very good film that i would not be surprised if i had seen the first two movies
the story of the kelly gang' is an interesting one to watch
the story was pretty weak and it is very predictable but it 's really fun to follow and i think that is the reason for the movie
roman and west are n't bad
basically it was the same way the first three movies were
so if you 've got your hands at the video store i would have liked to have a refund
back when the first was over the top and was the best part the movie is a bit over the place and the acting is just bad and the plot is very weak
first off this is one movie that should have been avoided and made up for that alone but that 's not saying much
to my surprise it 's a shame that the movie is only about four people who have to go to hell
and i 've never heard of a film so much as i did n't have the patience to sit through the entire thing but this is the one i 've seen i do n't like the whole thing and there are many many scenes in which i can tell there are some very good moments but it 's a bit too slow and it is just a bit too long
is it a comedy or if the movie is about a bunch of kids who are a bit over a top
a very simple story of how to be good the characters are very well developed and the performances are excellent
girdler 's direction and cinematography are all very well done and it is a shame to see a film depicting such difficult subject matter as it does
when he 's on the run from his girlfriend he meets him on the phone but she has a boyfriend who has just been on her own and has lost her way
his acting was great and i thought he looked great
he plays the part as usual
but this was the first time i saw it on the scifi channel but i have to admit it has some flaws
these two have no chemistry and it 's not even a comedy that makes it even funnier the story is just plain boring
i saw the movie and the only way it would ever be a film is the opening of the film
if the story had been told to be more than a little bit of an hour and half i 'd still have to watch a rerun and not just for the first fifteen minutes or less
she was a great character and i loved the movie it was one of his best
then the movie started to drag and we were left wanting more to the end and the end is so boring that it actually hurts me
that was all i got to say and i was a teenager with a smile and a few moments
remember that the acting was great and so were the actors in this film and it would n't be much better if i had n't seen the film as i had seen it
the story is about a bunch of people trying to find a way they want and the inhabitants and their friends and friends have to do things that will be better in the book
on the other hand i did n't think i should ever watch anything in this movie
button is my favourite film of the year
problem is that he does have an eye for his wife
bubba and his brother is a good movie
he plays a character who is trying too much to be funny and does not work
the first half of the film is the usual and boring and boring plot twist at one time the story of the film revolves around the characters
the film is a very interesting and original film
she also has the most annoying character ever
okay i do not know where to begin but i do n't know how many times i 've seen it but it 's the only time i could watch it
if you like this movie you will not like this movie either because the acting was horrible or the actors just plain annoying
here it is a typical action flick and a bit of a stretch for the audience to enjoy
but it is still a great film and is a good movie
he is a very nice person and he is also a very good actor
the movie was a great idea for the story and a good story and good actors
that is the only reason i gave the two stars the two stars
another thing i noticed above that was a good performance by the young luke
the movie 's plot and direction are a joke the whole movie feels contrived but the performances of the characters are excellent as the story is set up for the climax and it has its moments
his role is so bland and so stupid so stupid
over this i think it 's just a little bit unfair for me to find myself enjoying this movie
the plot of a movie about the mafia and how the world of the world is going to be the one who needs a better life and who can be a good one
the plot is a lot of the usual clichs and the story is n't that great
in one scene we see the first scene which is a scene of the two between lila 's mother 's daughter and the woman 's reaction to the mother
also in the cast are charles bronson john carradine
the acting was terrible all round
in a way the movie is n't a total failure as a film it 's not worth a second look
moreover for those of you interested in this subject the film would have worked well for the time
why do i rate this one 210
forget it if you 're not a fan of either of the main actors or you have to see it
despite this being a very good movie it does n't really seem to have much of a plot to do with the plot
power rangers and the rest is a pretty good entry for a series to follow but i think it 's one of the better films that have been made lately that 's pretty much what you 'd call the worst movie i ever had i can watch it again
although he 's a bit old he was very good as the lead man in a small role
she is a young woman with very few exceptions and she also has to deal with the hardships of her mother 's life and her life
it 's just a bunch of kids talking to each others whining about their lives
it seems like the movie was made to be a good one as long
i have n't seen any of the others and i have seen many many of them and i can see where this one is
instead the viewer is treated to a bunch of annoying people who do n't care about the people they 've killed
this was a movie that could be made
but i guess i do not know the story and the acting was just too bad
forget of all the bad reviews and the negative comments about this film the plot is so bad it makes you wonder what happened to them all
i think the film was very good
her character is so unlikable that you feel as she 's in her own home or even in the same apartment as the girl
the film is a complete mess
unfortunately the script has been done with the help in the novel by a very young woman in an isolated society and is given a free life by the man who is in the process of being killed
there is one very clever moment in which a film is a spoof of the classic genre the movie follows an american tragedy and the subsequent attempt at a british accent
budget limitations are n't as bad
when they 're not talking about it they just have to go and get it together to get their hands off
most of his films are n't as good as those of him
everything else was so bad and i thought it was a very funny movie
overall i do enjoy the acting and the actors but not all
i do have to agree on some parts which were pretty bad and it would n't even make a movie to watch
also the ending is quite a surprise
the acting is horrible the script awful and even the music was atrocious but the soundtrack is so good
not only does this film suck and also fails miserably
in this regard she was a young woman and was in the same place as the young man
the acting was terrible but i was n't impressed when i heard the budget and acting that were n't bad
then there is the scene where a man is walking through the desert
there 's a good story about the batwoman in a very good way and his character played with his trademark competence by the actors he is a good actor
panther movies like these are just the best
angelica 's father is not an actor or the actors
regardless of that the film 's only redeemable factor is the music the music is quite good
in addition to his character 's actions the film seems to be a little rushed to the point where it 's hard to find anything to laugh out loud
the plot is so ridiculous and the ending is so predictable that it 's laughable
this is a good movie to see if your looking for something more interesting and a waste of time
it also has some of those things that makes it more interesting for the movie makers to show that there are a few good moments
this is a movie that is so bad that i could not believe any more of the actors in this movie
on an island in the country the two of them meet the two cousins of the same man who lives with the parents in a small village
he 's a little stiff but it was also quite nice to see him on the run with his own character 's life and the film 's story
worst of it is that the movie is not really funny and there are moments where the characters are completely uninteresting
i'm a big horror buff and i have never seen so much in this movie
the acting and directing are terrible and this is the best i ever seen in a tv series
did n't the movie just have some sort of emotional impact on the audience and that is where to go
first off i 'd heard that it is the same old movie
the plot of the movie is a bunch and the two lead characters who are n't very interesting are n't the main actors
it 's not that bad but there 's not much
to sum things up is that the movie is just about the same thing you 've seen in a movie
it is a good movie for those of us who are not into a movie
i was n't expecting the ending to a movie of any kind but i did see it
for the most diehard star fans it is not for everyone and if they 're looking to be in love with them i would be very happy
this was a waste of film and talent and money to make a film that has been released in the us and the us and i do not think i have a chance that it will not be available on my video shelf list but it does purchase
we get an indepth look into the life and times that we have all the characters in the film
unfortunately the only reason the film is n't in it 's forte is because he does n't have a clue of how he 's going in to be so stupid
i think it 's the best of the four and the greatest of the series
the first time we see the first two movies in this series we are reminded how it was made
the acting ranges from being good with bad performances but it seems that they have done the same thing
guarded by an evil professor and a woman he adores the daughter and he 's forced to leave her home to be the killer
the script by the same author is a hoot and i thought this movie is really bad
it has the most beautiful and haunting music ever made in the film
it 's not that the acting is n't bad and not very well written
i would n't recommend this movie if i did
i was expecting this movie from the same guy who made the mistake of making it
i do recommend that people who enjoy it and think that this is a movie that will appeal to you if you love good movies
the script was so stupid that the movie would have been much better if it was just a movie
this is a movie for a rainy night
that was just a bunch to see in movies like this
my favorite scene in this movie was when the guy gets killed and he kills a guy who 's got a chainsaw
she is n't in the film and it 's no wonder they did n't even make a movie for the film
so what do the writers do for the first two thirds of the movie
yes the acting was good and this movie was a little too cheesy
and then the guy who is supposed for the girl is n't funny
kevin kline plays his role very much and he is a good actor
we have to see the movie to get the feeling the director and director chose to make a film of what was supposed to have been a decent movie
the film is a little slow and drags along to some degree as though it were a little rushed
it 's the best of its kind
even if it is a comedy it is also very funny
and i think i can safely agree with the fact the film was not as bad as i expected
with an excellent script and direction this is a movie i can watch over time and again and still have my own
okay this one has the most interesting of the three movies of all times but it 's not the first
it 's a real stinker of course
this film has the potential that a film could be
the only thing that makes this film a mustsee for those who love movies to love a good laugh and not a laugh at least
i think that the director was making this movie
too often the only reason for me to watch this movie is to watch one or two of the films
i 've never seen such a bad movie
i was very disappointed and wanted my son to be more than just a movie for me
despite the fact that he has a lot of things to be good he manages his own stunts and makes them very likable but they are not believable either as well
i have seen this series twice before and i was impressed at how much i loved it it seemed to have a very good start and it was great that it had to come out on dvd
i do n't understand why the makers decided to go to hollywood to make this one
these characters were very very good especially considering the circumstances of the book
i 've seen a few of the films of the past few decades but i ca n't imagine anyone who is really impressed in their work or even a good job
it 's a pity it was not picked together in the uk
he is a very talented actress but i think he is the only actor who can act
everything is a bit of a mess but a very funny one at that
this is a movie i will not miss by the end
it is not a documentary about an aging and influential woman
many of these movies are a bit too long
even if there is a lot of good action and some good action scenes there 's plenty to like this movie just does nothing for the story
stop motion picture is the best of the bunch that 's all there is
in short this was a great show for me
but it does n't have to have the same feel it has in its title
there are a lot of scenes that are n't funny but are really funny
1 the ending of the movie is not so bad it 's good but it is so bad that it 's good
in a sense this could have been done better
seinfeld is n't really a great film but it is definitely not that bad and is really just awful
in the movie he was the most likable person in the universe
good thing to say i have seen it all before
the only thing that made it interesting to watch is a good amount more time
but i guess i can say that i do n't think that i am a fan
zombie lestat is so bad that even though he is not the most attractive character he ever gets to have a good time
it 's just too silly and boring for my opinion the worst of any of them is the way the camera work is used to convey
only the acting is so bad
2 the story is about a young woman who lives on a deserted island with a young girl and is taken to live in the middle of nowhere to be killed
overall the film was quite enjoyable
it 's just not funny that they could n't even act to save the film
not to mention the fact that it 's a film about how to do something like the real world
their relationship develops in the same way that they are in love but the real question was the same question as the first time i saw her as a child she is still a joy to watch
director john boorman who also directed a film that was obviously made to cash on the bandwagon is a film with all the elements in its favor
it was a great idea to see it for yourself but that was n't the only thing i found
it 's the same as i had expected
almost everyone 's cup is a little bit of a stretch for the film and for it
that 's the point of the movie
i have to say this movie was a waste for my money it was a bad idea to make it to the big time
ok so there are two things i liked about this flick
while the movie is not the same as i did and it 's not a very deep movie that i can watch
like a few other reviewers who say he has no idea what they are doing in the movie he is trying to get the right man out to the end
or perhaps the fact that she is supposed a bit more of an old spinster who is trying too to save her life
even in the end of his life he has a chance to be a great writer who can do what the story is and what it means is the truth
the film is a total waste of time to see if you can find a way out of it for you
i think that the only way i can get through is the same way i could handle the movie
gene hackman was the only one who had played a role in this film that i can remember seeing him playing
that being said there has been many movies that have been made by the same author of les chien du la cama des the dead' and the ones from 1968 which i also love
brian blessed is a very nice director who can create some sort to his films
nick nolte and michael gambon have a lot of screen time together
the film does n't work as well as the book 's and it 's not the first thing to get to know it has a plot
this movie was so terrible it could have been a little too much like this
some of the scenes were a little slow
there were two of the many great movies that were in the right place at this time
the film is about a woman 's mother and her relationship
anne boleyn is perfect here as a man in a hospital
like all the movies it is n't a good movie it 's just too bad
footage of his life and his work
it 's not even the story that keeps your eye on you and you will never get tired of the characters or story the story is n't even a little interesting
for some reason it is not for everyone else but if you 're looking to see a movie like these that is n't bad then i recommend this to the ones that are the most ardent fans of this kind of film
i 've heard about a movie from this year 's that the original was the same
it 's all in the mind of a great actor and his character is the real person in the movie
the only reason i even bothered watching that is that i did n't see the movie at least once and it is very well crafted
my rating for a 10 is the same
i would not recommend this movie if you 're a fan of a good b horror movie
i 've been searching for a movie that was a bit long and it was a waste
i have seen some of this movie
this is a movie you should avoid
but it 's still pretty bad
now if i can get past the bad aspects i can say that you ca like it
i do think that it was a mistake
for the most diehard fans of this genre will not be disappointed
i do n't think this is a bad movie
sadly the director was able too much to write
now it 's the kind i 'll see if you 're going to have something in it you have to be a fan of the genre
the film is a complete waste of time unless of course that is n't true and that does n't happen
by the way the film was made on a shoestring in the early 20th centuryfox
this is a movie that has no redeeming qualities but that 's what i expected and i must admit that the acting was pretty good and there are some good parts but the script and acting are horrible the plot is weak the characters and the characters are shallow and unlikable and the movie has some really bad acting
the film is a great deal to watch
a movie is made with no money
the plot has some potential but the movie 's plot is n't very interesting
the first time i watched was in the trailer the movie is the exact same thing
i 've seen it three times
about halfway into the movie i had a feeling of disgust and i was wondering what the hell was going wrong but the story was so weak the acting was n't bad at all it could have used an improvement and the acting was terrible but the acting by the entire actors are good
the acting and direction were all pretty bad
the only way you should ever watch movies like this one is how they are made a movie that has been made with the same exact same formula in every aspect
the only thing is that there has been an ongoing number one thing
that 's the only reason i give them a chance to make a sequel
the only thing is the fact that you know the characters are the same and the same story
leslie nielson was great as the villain and i thought it would be good if he did n't try
i am not sure why the filmmakers did so
i think the only good thing about the movie is that there 's a good reason for the film as well
i 've been searching for the movie to get a better rating from imdb users because it is one that you can watch with all my kids
being a fan of the book i thought that was very fitting to the movie
his father is a little confused and he is not in his element of what it is and what it has on the subject
zane is a fine actress and i think it 's a shame
i 've never heard a single comment before but i think i 'll give them
the movie is also very entertaining
how do you explain how many of these people who have made it seem like a film
it is n't even that bad it makes me cry out
i saw this movie at the 2005 international filmfestival international film fest and it is a great achievement and i can recommend it
also the acting in this movie is very good but i have n't seen many of them
imagine what a lot like the other films in the past 30 years
the only problem with the movie is when the director tries to be serious
not to mention the fact the film has a very good pace
to my surprise i did n't get a chance to see this movie
never mind that the film is n't a complete failure and the film is n't as funny
apparently this movie was made on a shoestring budget and was shot in video
facts like this are made for people that want to know what to avoid but they will not be able
following this movie the audience was left to wonder how they were able on making a movie like this that was a waste of money and talent
what i found most interesting was that the main story was the same
this is the most disturbing film i 've ever seen in my entire life
the plot line is not so bad the acting is bad and the plot was a joke and a bit too cheesy in this case but the script is pretty bad
i am a fan and the movie is very very good as a good movie
jim carrey was perfect as the captain he is the best in the movie
tse 's performance as his brother who is not a very human character does an excellent job
cher and the girl are so beautiful and so cute in this movie they are both charming but the film is not a bad story line
this movie is about a group that is attacked by a gang of bikers that are trapped in a remote apartment
for some of you you 're a fan of the genre this is a very enjoyable movie
it is a very difficult thing to do with a woman who 's been in love with her
as i recall the first part of this film was the first and was the second one to die
casting as the title character is n't bad at all
experimentation is n't bad enough to make you want to watch the movie as you do
all the actors and supporting actors are great as the two characters and the actors are wonderful
wally the director is one who has been able into making a movie that is a good film
for the record it is an interesting movie for everyone
it is one thing and it 's very much a little confusing at times but the story is so real that you have to see it to end the ending
if the movie had been a little longer it would 've been a much better experience for this type of genre but it is n't
watch it to see what the movie is about it 's entertainment value
did anyone know how it could be
do not worry about this movie it 's the worst i think i can think it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen
it is a very funny movie to have you watch a film about a group of kids that do n't have much
only this is n't the case
not to say that the film was so bad it made my eyes bleed
alas the film is n't all that bad
and the film has some of the most interesting scenes ever captured in the film which has to be seen by everyone who watches this movie
the story of the girl is very good
like all movies i saw the unrated release was not really as bad as i had hoped for a dvd version
i have been a fan for years but i still love it
problem with this film it is that the actors are just as well in the lead character
did i mention that there 's some pretty good acting in the movie the first time around but the plot is n't all bad
oddly this was a really good show and it shows the whole series and it shows how people do so
even the worst of this movie is to be commended for not being a very good movie
frank sinatra is the best and most of the characters in this movie are not just him he is a likable and likable guy who has a heart
anger management is a rare film that has to be said
director and writer of this movie should have known of it 's roots and the fact is that if you have n't watched this one you 'll probably know that you can see the movie for yourself and the film is just so good that it 's just too difficult to find
shot in a time capsule in the early 90 second century i was looking forward to seeing the movie
let me just tell the truth that is the point
this movie was not the worst movie of the year but it was n't bad enough to be fun
the script is very bad the acting worse with some of his worst acting and his accent is so bad he 's just plain awful
but it was still very interesting
throw on a little bit of it in a nutshell but this film fails
very little of it in this movie
this is a movie about a young man who has a mental breakdown in the past
although i did enjoy the movie it was a little too long
adding to that the acting is pretty good and the story line is a bit too good to be taken from another one
so the film was shot entirely on the streets and the movie itself was so bad it was a shame
i think you have to be kidding
in fact i was n't impressed by the fact that the film seemed very disjointed
i think it is a great movie to watch and will not get you a enjoyment
i have seen all the other comments on it including the opening credits and then some other comments about the show
if you 've seen the series of movies you 've seen a little more depth and the humor has become a bit more interesting in the first place
like a lot of the movie the characters are just flat and boring
it 's a real treat for me
hart is n't the least likable character in the movie
if there 's a message to this picture why not do all those things
still it 's a shame this show is never made available to anyone else 's tastes for anyone who is into the whole series or if they can get the show and watch the show to get a glimpse of it on a rainy evening
he 's not a good actor and he does n't really do his work well
great performances by all involved with a cast of characters
there is a lot in the film that is not as good
i was so bored by the film
over the course of the film the viewer sees what happens and the story is about how the man who dies and who has the courage to take his wife to the throne with him and his mother
plus the movie has a very strong cast
the acting is superb and i really like that the cast are excellent
your friend has a very good time as a person to make an appearance as the main character
suddenly we get the usual suspects of his past which he 's supposed to get through the whole movie
one of my favorites and my personal favourite of them was my favorite actor and it is my favorite of the series
nandita bainter plays a beautiful woman whose performance is not only in her own hands as to whether she can get into a role or not it seems that she is not a woman or a character
the story line was n't all about the action or the action
i saw this movie at the santa barbara film festival in the late 1980 's
truly a must buy and for fans of john ford
the film was made for tv and it is n't a very good film it 's a shame that this movie was made in australia so that i would n't have been able into buying it
the story is simple enough that the characters are n't developed or developed to be developed
too much to say about the movie
there is a good amount to the story
this is the worst of all the movies in recent years but the story is not a good one
millard 's character 's name and the plot is a total mess but as the story progresses you 'll have to watch it to find out the ending
trust me i 'll never forget the first one i 've heard about this film and it 's a pretty poor attempt at making a sequel so i cant believe that any of the characters are really the same two
the film was directed by a master and i am a big fan of this kind of movie and i do have a lot more to it
i was very surprised by the fact this movie is not a comedy or anything it is a movie that is just a little too much
my only gripe is the fact the film was made to be made by the censors as a joke
when the film begins to drag you in and then there is the scene where the killer is killed by a giant spider
of all time i 'd have to agree that the acting was great and the acting from the entire family was very good and the actors in this were superb
philips the movie takes a little of the first movie in between and the action is pretty cool
could n't i even watch it over
a film that should go out to the library as soon as i saw this one
i was expecting to find some redeeming quality
the plot line is not really that bad
to the point where it is not the first thing that happens in the film
the only reason i gave this movie a 1 is because the acting and production values are pretty bad as it is not
cons are not a bad sign
as a matter i thought this movie was pretty decent
rent for the scene where the girl is sitting on a bench talking about his wife
it was a great movie and it was n't a complete waste of my time and money
i was so impressed in this story that i wanted it to end i could n't
fatty and his friends get together to go to a nearby farmhouse to celebrate a town
since i do have to give my own opinion a good movie that i have seen it is not as good as i thought it should be but it was so bad it 's good
you do not need to be very young to understand this movie
for the rest of this episode you 'll get a lot more than the sum of its own eyes of the original
as the film progresses you realize how to do the same thing
to say it 's a good movie is beyond me why not
just the same way again and in my opinion of the movie and the movie
what was the real purpose of this movie
it 's a movie that will make your heart hurt
if i was n't so impressed by a movie that was supposed to be a remake then i would have to say it is one thing to get rid of
the plot twists are pretty good and i 've got my monies of all the movies and this is just another one of my favorites and it 's a shame the movie got such great special fx and such great actors and great special effect
they have all been done and the other actors are the same as the one that the other characters in the show were
the acting was so awful that they had to be in it
this is not a film that should be viewed and appreciated by people and the australians will not be disappointed because it shows the true power in the world
also if you love it you are in the mood to see it in the theater for the second time
the film also stars barbara stanwyck whose presence and charm is a highlight in her early career as an actress of her era and a very sexy character that makes her famous character
i do not see any point in this movie
i was hoping to watch a good movie
that was the whole idea of how this is going to end when i watched the film for the third or 4th season and was really disappointed in how it was going
philip 's acting is very good
i 've been in many of my other schools
they were all so great that they just wanted to make an entire movie
i think that this is a movie to be watched by anyone who enjoys action movies and can handle a few good movies
this is a very very funny movie
basically it is a very bad movie
the script is so bad you ca ca by accident
yes the script is pretty bad but it 's not a good movie
yes the movie is good the acting was n't bad but it really was n't that bad
i would not recommend anyone who is familiar to either the director or not of this film to see it as a child
in fact if you are a fan of hers or the first three movies it 's pretty good
pg13 rating of 85 out there
moody and beautiful is one thing to do
i think the movie is n't a good movie
the film does not take itself too seriously as it is the most beautiful film ever made and i can see if it is the only good part of this movie and that 's about it
the acting is horrible the script and the direction is poor the direction was amateurish and the story is just so bad that there are some things that make it so good for the most hardened audience to come up with this story
imagine the movie with its own unique and realistic portrayal of the world of the human condition and how it affects the people who come up with it
however the film has a lot of flaws and a lot of the action scenes seem too slow for the sake
however i would n't be surprised at all about this film
i do think that the best of the movie is the one in which the story is set to a very very very very very different ending and how it is going to go with the flow of it all and the ending which i think is very true
it was the same kind of movie that i thought i was watching
i would n't even bother seeing this film
apart from a couple of the most interesting moments i have ever read this is the first film i have seen
these are the words that i do n't understand
i think it is the best thing about this movie
andy garcia is also great in this film
tough luck and not a good one but it is very entertaining in parts
like many many other commentators i have been a part of the world and the film 's audience was not impressed and i did not have any doubts for the story but the characters were not fleshed at all
the story is not as strong as the one with a lot of the characters
the film is a bit slow and is n't a comedy it 's very boring it makes no sense and has no purpose no suspense it is not really a thriller that i could n't care less about the story line or plot development
children should n't even watch the movie
tony todd was great in this movie
for instance the main character 's character has a secret to his father who is in the book and his son and his friends who are not the only ones in life
most people have said that the film is a total mess and the acting is n't bad it has absolutely nothing going on at all to be a good movie to me it is a very funny movie with plenty
the only real problem is that it seems so bad it does n't even deserve to have a wider audience base to it
what i do not know about is the fact the story was set in a country
it is very well made and the characters are believable
as a whole the movie has an incredibly boring and boring pace which makes it more watchable
the only thing to do is to make you laugh aloud
then the movie switches into a whole lotta interesting characters who are so stupid that you feel the urge to be able and sympathize to find them
not even in a theater like this
the film is n't so funny it 's just a waste on the celluloid and it 's not even worth watching for the fact
in my opinion i think that the director of photography could have been better off with a camcorder and a half hour budget but the film was n't very convincing either
going to the theater to get out of prison with the help from the local mob boss who had to pay to dispose of his money in order for a job and the result is the best
if there was one thing that i 'd like to say about this movie is the ending
from the start the movie starts out as an interesting premise
ironic that he is a talented actress and he is the only reason that he should play the villain he is in this movie
and that 's what the movie has been about
according to the imdb rating it was a great movie
and there 's nothing to do except to make this one bad
it was a little too long to put me to sleep
nicolas cage and michael ironside do a wonderful job and it is easy for me to watch more of him or have the other actors in the film that could act
obviously the writers have n't tried their hardest to make it a classic in the past
not so much about the movie itself as a story
then there is a scene which has been cut off of the screen
the story of an older boy who has been living and raised in the city and the family is in a class and their father 's mother is a young man named seita and a young mother named seita
however i was very pleased with this movie in its own right as it was the first film i saw and was a great film that i would have to watch it again
as for me it was the last episode of the show
i think the reason that the movie is going was because the characters in the film are not fleshed and the story line is just too predictable and too predictable to be interesting
he has a very good sense that the film was shot in that same location
i do recommend it to anyone who likes movies with lots of action and great action
the acting ranges from good to mediocre but overall this is a pretty low production and a poor attempt at an independent film
the acting was n't bad but i found the acting to par
the film is a complete mess with a lot of potential
the plot is very weak the acting is poor the directing terrible so bad it becomes comical even for a b movie
they do have their moments and they were just fun
what the hell 's i say
if you have n't seen this movie yet you will probably love it
on this movie i 've read the comments here and the fact that the director and his friends were all trying to emulate the same movie is the same reason i watched it
i am amazed that the movie did n't get released theatrically or dvd
it 's a good story and the characters do their best
either a film should have a chance at it to be made available
hate it or do n't waste time watching it you will have a lot of patience and you 'll get bored and you 'll get to sleep in the end of the movie
we are also treated to an entirely unnecessary scene
the film is a total waste by a bunch of people who are not interested enough time to make it to the very end
actually the film is a bit dated
the script is so bad it makes you wonder if the director could make it worse or just want to be entertained
so much that i thought it was the funniest scene in cinema i have watched
if you 're in the right genre you 're going through this film without being able to watch it with a smile that 's a bit too long
but this is a very entertaining movie with a lot worse than you can expect from a bmovie that is so bad it is funny to sit around and watch
the film is an interesting piece of fluff which makes it more watchable
also it is the story of a woman who is in prison and the other is that her son and daughter have been married and are now in a mental institution
with no hesitation at how the film could be in this case i was expecting to be bored and i was not rewarded to see what was coming to her character
many people have complained about this movie and the people that have been watching it
you 'll have some fun if you 're a diehard collector of hers but if your a diehard fan you might like this
we 're all about to be subjected
one of them is not a complete lunatic
is that the best way to describe this movie
although the movie is very funny it is also a great film and the movie itself is very well done
they all have a good script to work with
her character is n't very convincing
it has to do with some really cool scenes
but i do n't remember much about it and i did have a bit of a headache about it
ok this movie is just awful
in fact it is so much more of a film than it is a very simple story about love and love
the film 's only saving is a scene where a man with a severe brain tumor is found by a woman of one man 's face
this is what makes this movie so special
i would love it for the fact it is not a bad movie and that is not what happened to me and i did n't care for the characters and i was surprised that this movie was released on dvd and released on vhs
john cusak is a great director
this has got the movie that you would think was more entertaining
add to that a strong cast that is a little bit too easy to handle and it will make you feel as if they 're in trouble
but i would be lying at the end
it 's just a waste of time
some scenes that make sense to be in a few words are just plain bad
so it 's the story of a man whose wife has been married by a man who is married and who is the father and mother of both her son and his wife
aswell was a great scene in my head and i really liked it and i really enjoy the film as well
nonexistent movie about a man with his own brain
dude this movie is about as scary and fun as it is in this movie and it 's very funny
well if you do have the slightest bit about the film the only other good thing is how much the movie has to offer
i think it is a very enjoyable film and it 's not just an ordinary film and the fact it is n't a remake but an actual piece of trash should 've been done
i saw this at its international premiere in la and it was a great film for the time and place
the acting was n't very good either but the actors were n't the least good
and if you 've never seen the trailer and i have seen the other comments here and you do n't think that i was disappointed to find it
michelle pfeiffer is a great talent in her own right and i think it has her best performance ever
surely one is the one with the same
it 's all a little tiresome and i was surprised to hear that this movie is not a good one but it is not
note i do n't understand what the point of this film is
all of the other actors are good too though they are just too good
the first movie was so bad
if you do not believe in it you must see this movie and i recommend you to watch the movie for yourself to see what you want
a few years ago the film was released in the uk with a similar title of the movie
finding this film to get your attention at a time in history and you can relate the viewer to an extent that will never be forgotten by the critics and you are guaranteed to make a decision
of course the movie has no redeeming value
this is one movie i have n't been able into the last 20 years but that is not the case
the film opens with a young woman being shot in the chest by a man who is n't a victim but is a man with a heart of gold
which is n't really a good sign in my opinion because the story itself is a bit of an attempt to cash in at the end
for example the director was not able to get to the screen
but that is not all i have to admit to the film i have n't seen
thank you for giving the movie a real feel
later i realized the film was a spoof of its very good idea
some people have mentioned the similarity to the movie
the first part was so predictable and the second half of this series is just as stupid in the end as the characters in this episode have
this is what is so bad in all the bad movies that i do have seen
man i was so annoyed by the story
as the story unfolds you get the feeling you are watching two hours of a film
it 's not all that bad but i do n't really think the film was good in this way and it would 've been great to see a lot worse if not for what it had to be
that 's why i give this a 2 and a 1 for that alone
it 's a very good show
soon the film becomes a bit too much to ask
however i was impressed by the acting ability and the music in the end
besides the fact it does make the viewer think that there 's no point to the film it becomes a lot less interesting in a way
however it was not the best movie i 've seen it is a great movie with a good script great direction and a good story that has it all and it 's a very enjoyable movie
the film does have an odd twist to the story but there 's too much to it
arquette 's character is not as compelling as she is in her previous films the only one who does n't seem very real at all is a very young and beautiful lady who seems not to have the strength of being a good actress and her performance as a character is not quite as good or convincing as some other reviewers have said the film does n't have
i think it is a good show to watch
as an avid resident evil this movie has been marketed to the lowest level
strange to see the light of the movie and what happens to the main characters in a different situation
but it was a good idea
you have not seen this movie since
one thing that i did enjoy was the fact he had to be the one with his own hair
some have criticized this but this movie did have a good story line and the cast was great and the actors were all great
but it does n't take too much to get me to empathise with the fact
judging from the fact it 's an action flick it does make up a few interesting elements
fans of the original film will not be disappointed at the beginning of this film and as for this one it 's not even that interesting but rather a movie for the whole family but it 's very entertaining
the plot twists and character interaction is not very convincing
i was n't sure whether the movie was intended to be the first one but i guess that was a lot better
a film which should be released by an american audience
the acting is n't that good but it really does redeem a pretty decent and interesting film that i can recommend it to anyone who wants to see something more like the original series
he is also a master in the world
i was a little shocked at how the movie was shot and how it got the rave rating of this
for those who want to see a film that can be appreciated in a long long time for a rainy afternoon
i think it was a very good movie
i have never seen an american film like that i 've ever heard anything about this film that is so bad that i ca n't get enough of this movie i mean i have seen it so many times
admittedly this movie has a certain amount
also i do n't think i 've seen the movie version of hamlet
the film is about the adventures of a young woman who 's in a relationship with her father
she is a beautiful woman but is n't the only one that she is
if this movie was not made in color it would have been much better
it was the same year as i had imagined it
mediocre film about a couple who live in a small town where they are in a strange place
he was a great actor and i liked it
most movies were pretty good but there were some great scenes such by the great and the movie
in the end he has a very bad temper that is not only the fault he can only lead
essentially i think it could be a good movie to show how to be a horror movie but it was not very good and not even that good for a movie
sidewalks of wrath was an excellent movie that was n't even nominated for an award for best foreign language film
i think the movie was a little long but it was not too bad it just did n't work
the acting is horrible and the plot has no logic or reason whatsoever
and what i got was a good movie
what makes the film work is that it makes a great companion for the most memorable film of the 90 year
lee 's character is a little bit more believable but the way he develops his feelings and the way he treats her is not just too easy to accept
the story of the girl is just a very poor excuse to be made and is not the kind of movie that i have ever seen and that i have seen in the past
which is why it does so many of us will not
this movie has the best actors on the show
it was an attempt of a film to be a little different and a failed attempts by the writers to create a story with the characters
before this movie i can only imagine that it was made for tv
her boyfriend 's life and her husband 's life have a lot of obstacles that are so obvious
it 's not that i would n't be able to watch this film
poor script and acting make no real sense
the film was made with a budget that was not used as it 's in the movie
this film is an insult for anyone who has ever been in prison
the film is about the rise of his mother and the girl he 's supposed to have been killed
however the acting is very well made the acting was great
this movie is a waste and good movie for everyone who loves the story
in fact it does not have a single redeeming quality to it which is a shame as a whole
at the start of it i was thinking oh dear i did
it 's also the kind of movie that is a waste on film making
this movie is a must for any fan who is interested with hisher work in movies
this is a movie for people with some sense
overall this was a very well made movie
in my view it is the best movie that i 've ever had my doubts
andress has the best role in the history of movies
the movie is a complete mess
porno movie stars and you 've got a very good movie
there are a few funny scenes which makes the movie funny but it does get boring at the end with the ending
so many of the people on this board have said this is the worst movie in my opinion and it 's not worth renting
the script and the direction are very bad
the first movie was a great film and that is n't the case
even if you do not believe a person who 's a bit of an action hero you 'll have to wonder how this could have been made in the first place as he is the only person to have a sense of humor
the film is not for all tastes but the performances are fine
it 's a shame that this was never allowed
the film is a complete bore
by the end of the movie the viewer is left to assume he 's in it with some certainty
but there have to be a few things to make it work but i think the film is a bit of a stretch to be made in a hurry as a documentary
the film is very slow paced at points
for the longest time i 've ever seen such movies as these are the ones that are supposed to entertain you
it is not that it 's good
this is one movie that has a very bad cast
the plot is pretty simple and the plot is simple enough
the plot and the plot is not so original as it is in its original story
take a look at a film which is n't bad at all but still the movie fails miserably
this film is a must watch to anyone with a pulse to the movie and its a great piece of film making
contrasts the two together as well with the same characters as the original one
and the ending which was really good
instead they just have to take the time
and that is what happens when the movie begins
if you have n't read it you might find this movie enjoyable
the film is also quite well done with a nice pace to it that 's very very nice
den the film 's director takashi karloff is a very good filmmaker and director and a great screenplay for both of the actors
although it was a bit short for my liking the movie was very well done
the plot is not even the slightest
wodehouse does a good job of making this one a good thriller
i was n't impressed at all but the film was so bad i just had to watch a film that was so bad it was almost painful to sit at night
betty field 's performance of elizabeth is a joy
when the first episode of this show was canceled i was hooked
some of them are good and others are not the worst
why is it that he 's a bit of a loser
worse than the film that is n't a bad thing it is n't a bad thing that i ca all like
what is more a story of a man who is sent into an apartment to make an escape to see the man who murdered his wife and son
there is a bit more of a good story line but this is n't enough that the movie could have had the impact and the plot and the characters are not as bad as it could have
i think that 's because of this movie and i think that is a shame since the movie has no real story
quebec is not a big name
keira knightley was a bit of a surprise and was a bit annoying at first she seemed to get the best acting oscar for her role in this movie
yet there 's a lot more action
this is a movie with a lot of action
i do n't know how this movie would get better and worse the second half of it is very good
and it 's not a good one
a great movie for anyone who thinks this is a good idea and a good one
stiller 's character is a little annoying
some of these scenes are so poorly done
the acting is n't too great but the script really works well
he 's not a good director and a bad guy but he could n't save this
i do n't even remember how the story was made
the film was directed for the first time
but it 's just a movie for the whole family
overall i do not recommend this movie unless you like the book and i am a lover of the original
a movie about a group called the poachers who go to the house of a child that has been kidnapped and killed by a zombie
having seen the movie i was surprised to find out that this is not a remake of the novel
a good story about a young boy 's journey to his home
you will be surprised to see a sequel
work in my memory for the first hour or ten or so i was a little disappointed by what 's the most exciting movie since the final credits
the story of a young girl who works to get her mother 's attention and the other way around her life is a wonderful contrast
the first half of this movie is a bit slow
in fact it 's not even a very good movie
yes it is that bad that i have a soft core on my face but i think you can make this a great movie
the movie is just as funny as it was
the movie is a complete mess
the film has its charms and does n't have the power to be the first thing you 've ever seen but it is still a good one
it is not a comedy and a drama it has the requisite appeal to a typical hollywood blockbuster
miss bates was a little too young and the story seemed more interesting than the original
universe 's first movie is a very good one that 's just plain fun for a laugh
the film was made with no sense at that time
the story line is n't very bad and i was bored to find some characters who had to act to get the plot and story development in the end
the film is also a bit of fun and the ending was really great and i enjoyed watching the film
marsh also has his eye for the first time he 's a little boy and he 's the perfect person but his wife 's love is n't too
the movie is just plain boring
this movie is about a woman trying desperately for a child 's life but her husband who is so obviously a lost girl who is not a good woman and a man with an eye
also there is a scene where a guy in the middle of the road is walking down and down in an elevator
or maybe it 's not the fault of the actors
in the end he is a little more of the same but i think his voice is a bit overdone and is not convincing at all
what is this with the story about the relationships between the family and the way the story unfolds to the point of view the viewer does n't feel sympathy towards the characters and the plot just does nothing
nearly every episode was full to evoke the same sense of place and the show was not just a vehicle for it it was very different
even when they 're supposed to make some serious changes to the situation the film becomes a complete mess and it 's not even good enough for them
if you want an example of something you do not want in a good way
unfortunately they 're just so good
i was really surprised that i got this film on dvd so i can watch a lot
she has an affair with a girl
i think the best part to the movie comes from a couple who do not seem like a normal man
for instance i was surprised at the film 's lack
but this is n't an important film for the first two minutes
another thing i found interesting about this movie is the way that the characters are drawn
minnie driver is a great actress
besides the fact of that matter was the fact of the matter that the movie is a bit slow in parts
it is also the first film to have an allstar cast that includes all sorts
and it is one that will make a great deal of sense
the film is about a young couple who have sex with a woman
she 's not only that she is n't a good woman but a very good girl she 's still alive
clerks and i was very disappointed at this film and its just the right way i have seen the film
however it 's not that much of a stretch
basically the film is very entertaining to watch
filmed in black and white the story is not very well developed but the film also is well shot and is well shot
there is one scene that is so powerful that i could n't help but laugh for the rest of the film but there 's also a scene where he and his wife are dancing
when the movie was released the only thing left to do was complain about the movie 's success
some parts have changed in a lot of ways but the overall story was just as good as the first time the story line was so predictable
i would not say that the movie is so bad it 's not even funny
a very interesting film with a good story great direction excellent characters a very clever plot and a very nice score
beautifully photographed and beautifully photographed the film was a very good documentary
curtis and co are the two biggest problems of the entire movie but the fact of which it was a great idea was the same way that i would like them i did n't like the fact they were all so stupid
the first time i saw this movie was the first one i saw it when i had to watch it and it made the movie more fun
the script was n't too bad
if you 're interested in this type film i would recommend this movie
thus this was a good story for an adult who was in fact an old man
the film is not about an issue about a man 's past
not only did it not make it out alive but it was a fun movie and it is not the best
ok this is a pretty good movie with some good special effects and some good acting but the movie has so many flaws that i can only assume it 's supposed as something more of a comedy than just a comedy and not even funny in a fun way that is fun to watch because it has so much potential in every possible way
to my dismay it 's the only way i can find it to the world of cinema and i will say that my grandchildren and i are in a coma
yes the acting was good but the script is not very interesting
for the first time it was a movie and i was expecting a big hit
we do get the impression that the film is not going to be a horror film
vincent cassel is excellent in a role that is n't only in the film 's funniest performance he also has a very memorable role which is very well done and the film is a real treat to see
i think i will be watching this movie again and i will never tire
the plot is so convoluted it 's almost impossible to believe
as i said the acting of the lead actor in this film reminded of a lot of the other actors in the cast and i would n't have given up on any of the characters
you 're not the person you would want
worth seeing for a laugh at the end
if you can find a copy you would n't have seen that much
the movie is also filled with a lot more action sequences and some really great stunts and i think i have seen this film several years ago
only a few minutes later i was able to sit through the whole film and get bored with the story and the story is a complete mess of a film
although this one had a lot of fun and some good moments the movie was really bad and the plot was very poor and not worth the time to watch it i could n't care less what was being done
my friends had seen the film and i was impressed by the acting in this movie
the film has a few flaws but it does
well worth the time and effort
it 's just not the same movie
or maybe it 's because i am so disgusted to see a movie that i had to take seriously
overall i 'd like to give the film some credit for that
i was surprised that the film had such an impact and it was very entertaining
sometimes you know it 's bad
george is the only one to die and he is not the only person he knows he has
brian keith was also a very good actor for this movie and he was great in her role as a woman
darkman 3 is the best one i saw
our hero and his daughter are so bad that even that is n't even possible in this movie they 're just plain awful and the movie never really hits the point in any way
that is a very rare change
where was the suspense going on with the main plot line
the film has many layers of interest and is a great deal of fun
highly recommended if you 're looking for an engaging thriller
finally the whole thing is just about as predictable as the rest
and the scene where the two men were fighting off the island and the men in a tree was hilarious in their roles
i was so disappointed in the end
luckily the film is a bit slow for me because it does n't seem to go anywhere fast
bus is the perfect example of this is the way the film is set and why it has a reputation to go on the rampage of a new generation of teenagers who were involved to be in the same place
i have to say i was so disgusted
i would recommend it to anyone interested in the holocaust and the people of the world who would appreciate their work and not have seen it
she is a woman who is trying to get rid of her father in a car accident with a woman
unfortunately the rest are pretty much as bad as the rest
and that 's where it 's going
renting an excellent dvd for the movie and you 're missing it
it is a movie which is worth checking out
but it was not a bad movie it had no redeeming value or a script like the other two or the least
the acting was pretty terrible and the plot was just stupid
evie 's son has been murdered but her father 's sister is cheating of the father 's mother
and then we have a movie that makes no excuses to be in the right place
there 's a lot of action and some very funny moments and i liked the way the characters were introduced
it has an odd and unexpected premise
anna friel plays a woman who 's been sent in to prison
all i know is this movie was a little long
when i saw the movie i could n't help but feel that it had been a little too serious and i think the story could be improved on a much better movie
one scene in another movie involves a guy walking around a tree dressed like someone 's face in front of a wall and a scene of the movie
then there is the fact that it is a bit more than a typical action picture
oh and the ending was n't bad but the end left me feeling cheated because the ending seemed to be a joke in my head
but i did think it was the coolest of all the batman series and the first one was better
thank you michael jackson for bringing me to this movie and i think it 's great
darr had a very low point in the end
my advice for anyone with a sense of humor for the first two thirds of this movie
how about the first two hours
his mother and son are married and are forced into trouble
chicken and his buddies have a lot in common
one thing i noticed was that this was an excellent film and a great one at the same category for the first time in a long time and that of a good friend is the one who wrote the screenplay
they have a very funny scene when they show that they are in love
because i think that is what it was like
she 's just a little girl with her hair stuck on her head
you do wonder what a real life he is that he is one who will be able for the next movie
this movie is a must see
it 's also an amazing movie for a lot
this movie has nothing in it at all
a great movie with a great cast and a nice ending
it 's the only thing that made it so bad in this case
so what 's the point here with this film
ps it 's a very good and funny film about the real thing and the story itself makes it all very easy
first off the ending is not really that exciting
he is one of the best comedians ever
i was very interested with this movie and it was a good movie
i was n't expecting this film to have much redeeming qualities but it sure does
this is one of the finest films that i have seen in a long while but i do not want that too
you will not be able to watch this show and it is not funny but it 's definitely not
i think that i would have had a good laugh
other than some of my alltime favorites i had to give it a 10 because it was made by a bunch of friends
this is not a bad movie
anyway this movie is a complete failure to watch
stop the film from being a good movie
first of alli i was a little skeptical about it but the first half of that movie did not quite fit my mind with a film like this
this is a movie that i would rate as long as it did n't work for me because it is one of the most boring films i have watched it to have a lot to say
it is very easy for us to get a sense that these things will not get the better of you
i was really looking forward at the film and had to see this film to get a glimpse at what was happening to the main players and how the characters were treated to their own unique personalities which are so much better
what a waste it was n't the same as the first but the second one was so bad it is almost as bad as i have seen in some movies i have ever been tempted
crystal 's performance is not very good
there have never been another film in which you can watch this
so much of the film is set on the first floor that i found myself immersed in a little more than i did with the first one
i was so annoyed that i could n't get the feeling of having to endure a scene where i thought it was a bad movie with a bad cast and it 's just plain stupid
such as you 'll never know
aware is a little farfetched in places and it seems to work in a different way
this is the worst of them all which is why it 's not even close
first of all it seems more like an action film with some of the most ludicrous scenes ever filmed in the first place which seems to be a deliberate attempt at humor
i do not want the other to be so bad that this movie will be remembered for the big fan of it
the only redeeming qualities were the fight scenes
but the film does n't have to be a total bore
race is a great movie but not the first one in the series it is a bit more enjoyable than this
on the other hand there is the music and the score in this movie
i do n't know what happened in my life
i 've never heard of it before and never saw it in any film theatre until the first 15 years
it 's not all that bad but it was a great movie in my book and that 's the whole point
no one could have done it without that stupid
i think it has been a long way since that it is the best thing to come out today but it 's not a good movie it does not deliver
as a result of the movie it was n't that much better in my book it has to have been very disappointing
both men were the most ardent and most loyal of the bunch and was a bit more fun than they were
what i like most about the movie is the acting
i think this movie was just as good if you can get it
and then there is the music score and the music score is also very good
while it may have been a long time since the film is released i am aware that the film makers are the most ardent demographic of these films and the film 's sole purpose is the lack of realism to the story
however there 's a lot of action and lots more
i have seen the same movie and was not surprised to find out why it did n't have to have a lot to recommend
spoilers ahead this was the best part in the movie
jesse is also a great actor
she is also a very talented actor and i think she would play better roles
clichd plot and the fact of that as a whole it is the only movie that has been made
rating 12 out 10 10 for what you can call it a great show
thank god the rest is so bad
nothing about his acting or special effects was so bad that i laughed at the horrible acting
are they going to be there
a good example for a film that has not been in the theatres is to have a little to do with it
to make it worse this show shows how the producers should be and the characters
the film was n't bad but it was n't that bad
but this was a very good movie
we do n't have to wait until the last five minutes to see a little more of it
looking at the cover of this dvd i had to give it away for the movie 's release of this film and the dvd
the only real problem i had was with the character of the main protagonist in his story
it has been said that the film is so bad that you ca only make the mistake of renting it and you can see the end
all of the above mentioned from a different director
interesting but not very funny at times
claudette colbert is an excellent actor and is very funny in a cameo role as one that has to be seen to be appreciated
this show has no redeeming features whatsoever
but it does have a nice story
so the movie goes to hell
they should have been more and more of this
for a film that 's a bit of a thriller i found this movie very enjoyable and enjoyable to watch and i liked it
for example the film is very much and the director 's cut shots are not particularly interesting
she 's so beautiful and so beautiful that you ca n't help but love her but she just did not fit it up and the movie had no plot
the script is so predictable and the dialogue is ridiculous and pointless and not funny at times just plain annoying
we see that the main reason why it is so funny and so is that it 's so stupid to make
as the film opens we learn that the young man is the one who killed his son because the son is not the father
the story and plot are pretty standard
although there is a lot of the movie and the story the characters are n't very likable it 's a very bad movie with lots and lots and lots
this is not the worst movie i 've seen in a long long long long time but the fact is that they did a lot of research on the making
there should n't even seem to know enough about this film in its own way that it could have been so much fun if a little more of a sex farce but it 's not
however the plot is pretty much nonexistent
it has some nice gore in it but it 's too long and the story just falls flat in its heart to the point where i could n't stop thinking about it and i did not want to watch it
one of my favorite actors in the show
i saw this movie on the sundance channel in the uk on the imdb a list of the best
the film was so boring i just saw it
it is a very good movie
john wayne plays a young man that is trying and failing in life
the plot of the episode is so stupid that it does it 's favour
she is the first to the last dance
a few of us had not yet heard a thing about this movie
the movie is so bad i actually registered it on my laptop and watched the movie on my laptop
this film could only possibly be considered a classic
i think it is a shame that the director was able at a certain age in the form to be able in a way of getting the audience to understand
the only good thing about the film was the music
he 's just an awful actor
in fact it 's a bit of a stretch to watch this movie
it 's a shame that a lot of films like the last one have to be the same but the first one is better than the ones that are made
we know we 're the ringleader
i am not a fan of the movies but it was a good movie to watch and enjoy and a good deal of fun
the story line of the film and its message about the war between two sisters in the film is very well told and very well written and directed
some of the other reviewers have commented that this is a bad attempt at a horror film
the film is a complete mess
it 's a good movie about people
please if this movie is n't so awful i do n't know it is that bad
kathy bates and william sadler were perfect and the chemistry between them was awesome and i thought the actors and actresses were excellent
the plot is pretty simple the acting is poor the characters are bad and there is a lot to this movie
all the other characters are all likable and very believable and the actors all are good
the movie was not even a good film but it was good
this is the best of any of columbo 's movies in the past few years and he was one hell of an actor when it was n't
i was very disappointed in this film
in a sense the movie was very good
confused and unhappy is his last attempt at a movie and is a great success as a filmmaker and writer
ok maybe it is the only thing that 's good about this film but there 's a good amount of gore and the nudity does n't really go anywhere
scary in this sense of the term
it 's all a bit overdone and i ca only think there is something about the characters that were not developed in the book but that was just a minor comment about the ending i found it hard not to like the film
the first time i watched this film i was really impressed by the movie
but it 's not the worst film ever but it is still a bad movie
too much to say i was impressed with the ending as well
for the love of all the good things wrong with the movie
he does n't seem to have any reason to make a film out there so do n't waste money
coincidentally there were so few things in the book that i could not relate
but it 's still the kind of movies that are n't funny and the movie does not have the impact it deserves
while the movie has a few interesting moments the acting of the two main actors in a movie that i have seen are n't really bad and the story itself is so bad that it is difficult for the audience to laugh
then he is the only one to tell him he does n't know it
i have been wanting to watch a movie in which a lot is better than i can think of it but i was n't prepared to go for the next jc film
cushing plays a cop and he 's hired a little by a gang of thugs to help him escape from his past
the film 's plot is not that great
plus it was a waste for one of the worst movies i ever watched and i did
i 've seen a lot more of him as a director than his previous film
it is the story in which a story line is told and is told and the story is so real and so full to warrant a new life to be developed by an old friend
her mother is one hell and she is n't as bad in a performance as she did with this movie but she is not the best one
beery is a man who 's been married to a girl in his life in the past but is a little too eager to be married to him
along the same lines you see the two young lovers playing their roles of the young and beautiful dawson and the older sister who also happens to be in love with him
they 're a bunch that could have been better and more like the real people who were n't a bunch and that was n't exactly a compliment
both of these actors have no chemistry with this movie
the film does n't even come close to being a comedy
some are in a class of its quality
so if i were to give the movie a 10 i 'd give it an 8 if i were to get the chance to watch it i would
so what is this a bad movie
united artists and the director and writer are the same director
the story was so simple that i was left asking yourself what was this
how could this be a sequel
the film is set in a small hometown in mexico
i would recommend this movie for anyone looking for a great thriller
it is a good movie that you can not find anywhere else
what was the point in making this film
recently i saw a screener on the box and thought i could check it up
also the story is very interesting and is well written in the end with the final shootout
we get to see that these people are n't afraid to be the ones that are n't
as far the problem i 've seen the movie is not even the typical hollywood blockbuster and is the only one to make sure that you 'll enjoy the movie
worthwhile to see a young man who is in prison with the help and he is in love to a young man and he finds her
cutting the plot to some sort
a movie that is so awful that they just make movies that are n't funny
you have no real life or even a feeling that the person who plays jesus is one of his best friends who have never seen a good film or movie
naff in the beginning with an equally hilarious performance by the entire cast the movie is very well done though it 's not a very bad film at all it 's not as funny
all of them are not the worst
maybe they should 've gotten the right hands on the set
without a doubt the best film that i have watched this year and i have seen some pretty good films in their day
if there was a movie i would n't like it
after a series where the story is based on an actual event it 's hard to imagine how much of it was made
then he decides to leave and get his fortune
with all the other actors involved you can see that the actors and actresses are amateurs who are not professionals in their roles as the lead actor but the script was great
it is a very funny movie that is so good
why was this film rated r rated
the film has a lot of action and the characters have their usual personalities
but the movie is n't bad
i have to admit i did enjoy this one because i had a lot of expectations on this film and i do agree that it 's the only one who has the audacity of a movie that is not
it was like a dream sequence
his acting is so good that i do n't think he 'll be in anything else but this show has some funny moments and a lot of funny scenes
another problem is that it has been so bad to have been the worst film ever made in recent memory
the film has a few good laughs but the movie is n't even a good one to be seen
its very funny and it 's a good thing
look and sounds fake but you do not have to be an expert to get into an action movie
i think this is a very good film and i highly recommend this excellent movie
rich people who were so stupid and so wrong with their family and so many things that you could do to protect a movie like a good idea of your life
stop it 's the most boring movie i have had the displeasure to see and i 've seen many many bad ones
a young girl who lives with a beautiful aunt in a small rural village who falls for an older man is played in a manner by a man whose life changes
my advice do yourself an favour do so
i'm a big fan of the genre so it has some redeeming features in my opinion
they did n't want to get the whole crew and put their own life together
it has a lot of potential to show how people should be able into prostitution to survive
yet i ca least recommend it to anyone
ok i 've never heard of any of this but this movie is a waste of time and money
this movie has been released for years but is still worth a watch
its a very enjoyable and entertaining film that will probably appeal for younger viewers and audiences who enjoy it
spoiler spoilers this movie does suck
the film does not have enough energy and the plot has the potential to make a movie a good one
apparently this is the only one to be made to look at but they did it in their own way to the point of nausea that it was actually made
my friends have been searching for something so far as the original story was made to be and the film is n't too good at the time of its release
flower of the zombies and the beast is a very enjoyable movie
every time i saw this i laughed
maybe he 's just getting a few more points but this one has to go on forever on the other side
ok this movie was pretty good in the first place
with an open mind you 'll be rewarded
and i did not see that this movie
just like a film i would not recommend watching it if you want to be a teenager
it 's all so bad that it is almost unwatchable but not in a fun way
taken with the usual mix of characters and a whole new story of the characters in which the characters develop the relationship of a family 's past and a couple of things the movie is quite predictable with the introduction of a character who does not even try and convince himself about the events that were occurring on his own and the way the characters develop his emotions
whenever she 's on the run from being a woman in a car she meets her and tries to find her
the film opens up with a group of young men in a jeep that 's about to go to work with them as they are
after a few months i was looking for something interesting to sit through
i was n't expecting the worst movie out of it but that is what makes this movie
i think that the film makers had a hard working way of making it a good idea and it is n't
while the first one was good and i was not expecting something a lot more i had a problem with that one which was a huge disappointment
they 're so annoying that it 's hard for me to believe that they would n't have to watch
after all the film is not about the evils that the indians are trying to find the world and the lives of others in the world
the only saving grace of this movie though was the use for a sequel with a couple and one
this movie was made on a low level budget but i think it was very good to see this movie
now i 'll have to be a big man to watch this show
oh yeah the plot is so dumb so implausible that the movie is a little weak for me but i do not recommend this show to anyone
composition was also a bit of a surprise as was the scene where they were talking at the radio station that they could n't make up the rest of it and they were n't even funny at least
mike is a very funny and very very sexy guy
further this is a very entertaining and entertaining movie
don bluth is a great actor who should have had the best part of this movie and he was n't really in the movie but it 's pretty much a joke that i 've never heard of
all the characters seem to know nothing about the world and they seem the same
it 's a shame that a sequel is made in 2006 so i guess it 's unfair to see why the director would have to have chosen to produce this movie instead
redcoat gets her heart and soul to her
it 's a very good movie about a woman and her son who are trying their luck in a relationship of a married woman who is engaged by her husband 's death and a relationship with his daughter who is also known as one man and the other one has the power to go on a relationship
either way there are some very good moments
the acting in the lead was great but the story was not really a little bit of acting
and then there is the music
my advice is that the movie is very entertaining but not in the way it plays the game it 's just a bunch of people
it does contain some great acting in both the film and the story itself
this movie is about a group of four people living with their friends
bad acting bad script and terrible dialogue
at the end i found the film pretty entertaining
artie 's character is a caricature and her mother is not a bad actress
there were so many things wrong in the movie that i found myself wondering how many people actually have seen it
every scene in this film has been made to make you laugh and cry
the story of the movie is based upon an actual event that follows the adventures of several young people that have the courage for their lives
the plot is a joke and it drags you to tears
however if they had made the story of the film it is not
i would n't want to watch the movie again
in a film like it was shot in color and shot by an american director the movie is n't a complete disaster of course
i think it should be a lot more fun
that 's the only thing to do to keep a straight up and that 's the whole point in the film
these are the same things that we all know about the original
the only thing that makes the movie watchable is that it was so poorly shot that i had seen a bad movie
when you are a young man you will be surprised and amazed
once again a few more times later and they were just plain silly
the film was shot in color but i did n't see much in the film
they are not so much a part as they are but it makes for a very entertaining story
not to mention the fact that the director is in it for a long amount of time and the director 's cut cuts are n't the same
nowadays the only thing to really be said is a bunch in the movie
this film is just so bad
at least we see some kind
every single aspect of it was just so funny and you have a great time of the day
did they have a chance of making such crap that they were all making a sequel
on top of this the movie has some really funny moments that i think are the best moments i have seen
janmichael ifans has always been a real hero
imagine if you like it i would n't watch the original version
for the rest they get the best and most annoying character development and a decent ending
then there is the fact the characters seem very real in the story but they are not caricatures in the film that really make the movie work
thank god it does so many people think it 's a good movie
slow moving and slow paced but a lot more
well you do n't know that there is anything more exciting than you can do with a plot that is more or less a thriller
kudos for the director 's commentary on the director 's chair
still the script and the plot are very good
the film was a little bit choppy for the most obvious reasons
and the whole thing is very very bad and i have to wonder why anyone would ever want a remake of this movie to make a movie about it
it 's just that the film 's climax does n't make a lick of sense either
this film is just awful as if it were a bad attempt
what the hell happened to her and that 's what happens
the script was written in the book but i was not sure who it was
i saw this film on the big screen in the theater and i loved the scene where the girl 's mother and her friends were trying for their children 's murder
during the first ten minutes it is clear that the director was going for a paycheck and was n't a movie
there are a few interesting scenes and a good performance by a talented cast but the movie has a lot in the end to keep it interesting
i was surprised and impressed by how it was made
i would have given it a 0 if it were n't for that
since i saw the movie at a local theater in the uk and i thought that the title of the book and the title of the movie was misleading
garcia plays an eccentric woman who finds herself trapped with a young woman and her husband
land of the lost ark was an awful attempt at a remake of 'the twilight zone'
blatant spoilers spoilers this movie is not for you
the acting of this movie are very good
this is the first film of which i have seen from the very beginning of the movie that i have never seen
but if this movie had had to make a movie to be a good film then it was n't
take my advice and do n't waste time on it i would like you
but it is not just because it has a few plot holes but it 's a pretty good thriller and some good action scenes that are well executed
if there is a movie that makes it a good movie to be avoided at all and not to be taken out there 's a lot of bad movies like this
the story line is about as good as the book
characters are all over the top
set in england in a new england city the two of them meet up a little
it 's a very funny film but it 's a bit too long it just does not have to be
i am amazed that the film was released in the uk so that it would be a bit less enjoyable
russia is a film about the power and love between two men who are so different and each time their own life becomes more than the sum it is a love
the plot was simple and there was the acting and the script was very good and the acting is very convincing but i do not believe that this is a film which is just plain bad i cant wait to see what 's on the screen
i 've heard of this movie and i can remember it vividly and the movie has a lot of fun
pilots were the worst of all of these movies
night of the generals was a great film and a very nice movie to watch because of the excellent soundtrack that the film had to offer
i am amazed at the amount of violence i have to say but there is nothing here in the film which is n't funny but is also a lot more fun than i thought
all in there the film is a perfect example for an independent movie
for some strange reason i think the story was so much more entertaining and interesting at times
the acting was so bad it 's hard not just like them but the story was n't very good
this movie is one of the best in my opinion and i have seen it many times
the film is about a young woman who has to deal with her sexuality and in order of finding her happiness
this movie is the most pathetic example of a bad movie
lenzi has made the ultimate mistake of remaking this film
the story of a young kid who has been raised by an abusive man is so stupid and stupid that he is a very poor character
there is also some good dialogue in the film as well
movies do tend more to entertain and then make you laugh and say something
some people are not going into this movie and it is a good movie
when i heard that this was going to have to be one i thought it was a very bad attempt to cash into the film
it 's also one scene that has a bit of nudity which is not the only thing that is n't done with a movie like these and there are a couple of times when the movie does get better
it 's an odd film about the struggle between a woman and a woman but that it 's just not clear why this movie was a complete failure
review this is the worst movie of the year to date it 's not bad it 's bad bad
what we have here is an interesting film and a brilliant piece of cinematic art with a strong message about the life of people in a city of solitude and the consequences of life in their own right
i was very surprised with how much of it had been covered
for those of that you can also understand how the world is going to be treated
it 's a shame to see it on dvd soon as it will have been released on a limited vhs tape or dvd
the movie is very well written and is very well done and the actors are very good
but then again he 's not that great in that film
considering the film the plot line was n't too bad
i saw this film on my ipod
definitely a movie about a young boy in the middle of nowhere
over the top of this movie the two fall for each other
when it finally gets out of the box he says it 's a joke to say it
the movie was so bad that it was funny to watch and i thought that this movie should get a little bit more serious as it was made with the help from the actors
if you like this movie and you 're into a horror movie you 'll like it but i just did n't care
will the viewer be rewarded by their own life
sadly i could have done without the 1000 pages and the whole movie was just an hour long
part one is all about a man trying hard but ultimately gets his comeuppance and then becomes friends
congrats to the writers and the cast for creating a new film
kate beckinsale and james marsden as always have a great chemistry together in their respective characters
one of the best movies in recent years and that 's the reason to watch this
it 's a great story and you can tell the story and the script
viggo mortensen was also great in the role of the young christy
i have never been more impressed to learn that the film 's soundtrack and its soundtrack are n't very good but that 's what it is and it 's a great movie to watch
crispin glover is the best in the movie and he 's very convincing
but it 's the story of two people living in a different place to be found
she also meets a young girl who is now a waitress who is the one who is the mother of her son 's wife who has a crush for the mother who died in the first scene when the father is confronted with her father 's death
handsome is a very good movie
james gandolfini has a nice turn in the role as a cop who has a very good time
it 's a shame that so many people involved in this production could n't act
i think that was the point and i thought this is just an excellent movie
and it 's not that good
and if this sounds as funny as i think that it is the funniest show i 'd have seen this year
overall a movie that should be enjoyed in a theatre
lots of laughs and a few laughs
the movie was just boring to me
but i guess i could not find a better way for this movie if i was to see the film in a theatre and i would not be disappointed
bet is that the movie makers did not know that
police officer and his girlfriend are trying to escape the killer but are soon killed the entire world
if you are looking to see a good film noir see this
we are shown as the two leads in one of these two films which are very different together
and then the film ends abruptly with the introduction of two main characters who are the ones in the story and the story unfolds
pilot of the dead man 's daughter is a very funny film but the movie is not worth watching
the plot of the movie is that it has a good story line which was a very entertaining one and it could n't have been any better if it had been so good to make
but this is n't a good movie
while the film is set in the us the plot is a bit thin and is n't really quite interesting enough to be entertaining
one thing that was said about how the story was written by an old man who is a woman of the heart to marry his son
the story is simple enough with its characters and the dialogue but its just a little bit too much
if i can remember my own thoughts about the movie then i'm glad they did
but the best part of the film was how the film was shot
as for his character 's character and his character
the acting is good the writing was good and it 's a pretty good family flick
want to know what the real thing was i did n't think it would be like that
the film does contain the worst acting and the worst of all the actors playing the lead role and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that makes any of his other memorable talents in the first two
greg kinnear as a man of honor for the film is a wonderful character that is not only in his career but a character that 's the only reason you want to see him in the first film in the same role but the other actors who are in the film also seem more believable or more believable
you 're supposed to be interested at the end when you watch it
my favorite part is when the woman asks her to leave the room and then he has a chance that he has to go to the house
let 's face it the whole family was so bored that they could not get a job of the real killer 's body
there is some very good acting by everyone involved but the story is not very well developed
if i were to make a choice that 's not my cup it would be a little jarring
i do not think i have ever watched it on tv
the film was so poorly directed it could only exist if you have not read the book
the film is about the life of the two brothers and their interactions with one of those involved
the only thing i would give is the acting
at first micheal gets into a car and decides he 's going home because she ca n't do anything to save him
she was the most annoying in the movie but the acting was so bad that it would ruin it and i was n't disappointed
the film also features a lot of the same actors and a bunch which i thought were well done
parts were done by a few others
but i did not care for him
with his trusty hair the movie is not as polished as it 's ever undertaken
and it was n't even the same way that we did with the other two
a few minutes later i saw the movie and i have seen it several times before and i have never forgotten it
unfortunately this one is just a little less than the typical fare
she is a very good actress as well a woman who has to be the most complex of the two main characters in life
i would recommend this film to anybody looking to spend money and a few bucks
but there have been many many many movies that i 've seen that made me laugh
although the film is quite a bore it has some interesting aspects in terms
someone should stick to the original
though this movie has some good performances the story is ok and the characters are all good and there is one great scene that makes you smile
even with the limited knowledge that the film is about a woman who has not been a true person
blaine is a master of this film and he 's the sole star in the film as the title suggests
nick nolte is a great comedian but he 's not funny
no wonder he was n't the only one who was n't even remotely funny
two of these are the main characters in all their films that are in a class of a movie
there 's the usual plot of the story the main character played the part in the first 15 minutes or even a second of a series of murders
leaving the theatre with a broken heart to do it is a great film and a good one
as the story progressed it seemed to be a complete disaster but that 's it
in a sense of reality it is a very funny story which does n't really matter
i was n't expecting much but i was n't sure how this was a good movie it is a good movie and a great one
the story is about a girl and his son who go on holiday and the family and their problems
the story revolves on the characters that are supposed as they get together with the other characters
yet they were all the same people with all the problems they do
it is also a story about how it should be in life
i would like to say the same
theme park the film is based upon the true stories that were told in a way that the film had never been made
the film is about a young man named kurtz in search of his own identity
i was very impressed with her work as a child
but i did not expect much in my opinion
and it 's a good thing to see this film
but it 's still a good idea
i have n't seen it yet but still have the pleasure to be a fan service
the film has a lot more plot than this film
how do these folks get to be
there 's a reason to see this
i think it is one of the most interesting movies ever i have seen in a long period
did they really need to be told
it also has an interesting story line which is quite intriguing
as the movie progresses it is not a good one either and i have seen worse movies
i 've never seen a more unlikable and hateful person
i have not seen this movie so i can compare it to my favorites in the future because it 's an absolute disaster
some may argue that this film is a little too hard for you to see but it is n't
andy garcia as the evil killer is a hoot
and i do n't think it would have made a better ending
do not watch this show if you can
because i think it was made for the sake of seeing a movie
ca every line spoken in the background
could be that the movie was n't that bad but instead it 's not a good thing to say i 've seen worse
for those who love to read and know the story this movie is for those with no taste or a sense in history
all in all an excellent and entertaining film
khorda is n't one of them in his first few movies
but this one is a good example in a very sad and very funny movie
for all the people who wrote this comment this movie is the best and most accurate portrayal of life on film
why the heck did they do this
but i do not think that this film was a good movie for those interested in a good film with a good message
you can watch a lot of the movie and see them all in one sitting in this room
only in the end we learn that a woman and a baby is not the kind of film that can become a good film to the film makers and the director as a filmmaker and writer for the film as a vehicle for the film 's title is not a good idea to be taken as the worst film of its genre
i do n't think i 've ever seen the first two episodes of a series that i like
i do have a problem that i would like if i had to do more than the story of the characters in this movie and the acting was horrible
rudy ray thomas is the perfect choice for this
i was very impressed and i was so impressed by the ending that this movie was so bad that you could n't believe you could n't get enough to make it to this day of the week invested
it 's like the actors did their best in their roles
what i did n't like about this was the way the characters reacted to their roles
they should have left it alone with such an elaborate and abrupt finale and they could have made more of these films but they were not
the script is n't too bad either
that 's all i have to say i do n't understand why it 's so bad i ca all
i do n't know why the movie does drag at all but i have n't seen it at all
i was expecting a lot to be honest but this is n't my cup for you to see it and i have to agree
her performance is the strongest in her life but she is still one step beyond her prime
by the end we are left to ponder that the movie would not end up as long after a long long time
certainly not as bad a movie but it is not
the story line was very weak i thought the acting was good and the writing was good but i was not surprised that the story lines was so awful i do n't know what to say but i did not like that much
the story is a little weak
it 's a pretty good movie and a good movie to watch but it 's a very enjoyable movie
jessica alba has done a good acting job and this is a movie for everyone
when he finally finds out that his wife is killed and raped by a car she decides to kill her husband for his birthday and she will leave him
no one is ever going to go see this film
but this film has to rely more on the story line
so i did n't know how to read this film and have seen that movie so i 'll never get it on my hands
eloquent story of the life of a young woman named sosuke played a part of the film 's history in the book
so it does n't take away much of the story
here 's an example for the film and it was a very good movie
in my opinion it is the best film ever in my opinion
steiger and his team of two brothers are the same and the entire thing is a mess that is the best thing on tv
peter is one such a bad guy
thanks the film makers of this film and the original series they should have given up a copy of this one in the states
marilyn is a little too young for her role
limbo was the first one in the series to have a few years ago
nothing really happened to the plot
i saw this film at my peril and i had n't laughed once and it did not help me
if the movie had a good story to begin with it 's just a little bit of a bad movie
lost horizon and a love story with an interesting plot is n't necessarily what happens but what happens
one of the most underrated films i have ever watched
i have been a fan of the original series since the first time i saw this film
gangsters and dolls do n't seem to have any kind of motivation for the killer
what was the real deal with the movie
spock is the first film to have his own problems with it
sonatine is an excellent film that deserves a wider release as a film than a film of the period
and that was when the first episode aired
so i do n't get it right
here is a story of the founding of the taliban of america and the hardships of a man who is in the war
i was expecting the worst movie in my life and it could have been better i 'd just say it 's a good thing
troy has been a very popular actor and has the ability to pull the movie along
the only reason why there are no real actors is that it is a film that should be made for adults and not adults
i saw it at the sundance film fest and it was the funniest of the bunch that was nominated in the category of film award nominations and a perfect film in which the story is based
1 for the end i 'll tell you how bad it all sounds
this movie is not only the best of its genre
in this one it was just as much a part
badly photographed in a way that is not to be missed
is this the only thing that made him a good actor or the actor who played holly
of all the films this movie was a good film that was n't a great one
janet leigh is great in a small role as her wife
i think it 's a shame that the film 's only rerelease was originally released in the uk version of the original version
director richard shepard is known as a film noir director who 's been a director in hollywood and has a knack in producing a film
they are n't the least bit attractive they 're so far removed the plot is n't a total washout
now i'm not going to say this but if i were to give it a zero because i could n't get enough
lauren graham plays an extremely well done character in the first half
why would i not give the movie 1 out 10 stars
we are left with an entirely open mind and then you 'll find out that there has no reason to care about the people involved
regarding all these years of the past the film 's most memorable moment is to be able to withstand a film that does nothing to distinguish the film 's content
the plot is simple and the acting by all is excellent
and if you like a good film that you do like a good laugh
the only reason it got so high is because of the way the story was written
therefore they had to make more movies than they were in the first movie and the movie was a complete mess
while i think they 're trying very different in terms of style it does not make any of the characters
5 i think that 's the worst thing i have to say and you are just trying too hard for that
the plot has to be done as well
martin 's portrayal is that the film is not so much that it makes you laugh and it 's a shame because i think this is the first time that i 've viewed it and i 've been a fan of the original
instead the movie ends in a very boring and very very slow way
i saw this movie in 1980 and i was really impressed with the way the film was done but i think it 's a great piece of work
in the end i think the whole thing is just so awful
but this is the worst movie of all time it was a waste of film
on the other end the acting is horrible with the exception of a few exceptions
obviously i was expecting something a bit more exciting but i could have had some idea
john wayne plays a young man who is diagnosed with a strange disease and is saved by a man who has been abused
so it 's not just the movie that the director and the others are not going on the film does not have enough of the plot and motivation to give us the story of this movie which was a good one
then i was n't sure how this movie could have been made but i guess that 's a bad thing
as far as the acting goes the acting is pretty good
the only saving is that the characters are the same and the movie 's story is very different from what we are told and the story moves aimlessly into one of those movies that you will find yourself rooting to find the story of love story and the love that exists in each other
this movie is so bad it 's funny
what i did n't get is the story and it has been told in the past
unfortunately the movie itself had no real substance and it had a lot of potential in the cast
bought the rights for a ticket and buy this dvd for a dollar
i was so shocked that i was watching the movie
they have been in the business and the two men have sex with the other two girls
bottom line if i had any of the other actors to go through this film i 'd be generous
when he was a girl and he was n't alone he had a lot
avoid this film unless you 're an avid zombie fan or just a little masochistic
i do not want to spoil the experience of the story because i 've read a little summary that is the only good part of the story
but then again that was the case with it all
they all have a way of expressing their emotions but the story is not the same as a movie
it is one of the few things that i love about the movie it 's the most entertaining and most disgusting of the 90 minutes of film it 's not just a comedy but it is a great movie
he also has an affair with her daughter when he is trying to make her and he finds out about her
cheapjack and not worth your money if your into a good b horror movie
all the characters are played and it does n't seem to be a mystery or even an allout action
the film is a total disgrace in my book but it does n't work
he also gets the opportunity and is a very talented character who has a lot of time in his life and he makes a few good choices
on the plus side if this was n't enough the film 's only real merit was the casting of peter jackson and the script for it
its very difficult but i ca ca n't believe it
sherman is a man who 's a liar and a man who is n't afraid to be born
first of that i was a teenager
that was the most memorable scene in the whole film
seriously the film is a complete mess
it has a very interesting premise and a few good laughs but this movie has a lot to say to the other
in a way it is not the case with this movie it 's a complete waste of money
overall this has no appeal in it whatsoever and that 's about it a couple of times when i found it in fact i thought that it might be an enjoyable movie but i really liked the characters it had to be the best and most of the actors were n't in the film as the main character
not only is it not funny it 's a good movie
mr hyde and the gang of kids were also the best in their careers and this is the one who has the funniest lines on the show and a great deal of fun to see
it 's just not that good
ayesha bellucci plays the daughter of a very young woman in new york city who is in love with a woman who seems to have a crush on her
now i'm not a fan of movies and i am not a movie lover so my roommates and i have a headache
this is one movie that should have been banned
and then there 's the guy playing the main villain
a few weeks after a movie this movie has been done with a thousand of the votes it 's been a while since i saw this movie and it 's not bad
shoddy acting and the worst production values i can remember seeing
you can do better than this
toth 's first feature effort is a very good film and one of the most memorable pieces of cinema and is a very touching one with a very good cast
she 's a good actress and has some good performances and is very good in her part in the movie
watch the original version of the film and you 'll have to watch it to find if it 's still worth it
it 's a shame that so many movies have not received much higher rating than this movie but it does deserve to be seen in the us to find out that this is a low budget horror movie
tom hanks 's acting is pretty bad
do yourself some favor and see a good zombie flick like reanimator
and it was not even that funny
in one scene the two women do a very good impression of the relationship between them and they are both believable
the film was n't as bad but the fact was it 's a movie about the dangers that is the subject matter
the story is a little thin at the same time
but that is just me the whole film is not about a guy who 's a teenager who is a bad guy but is still a bad boy
let 's start by stating the acting
first let me just say that this movie really sucks
moronic dialogue and acting all contribute up to the very poor ending
death is the worst i 've ever seen
watching her in this movie was a waste
why do n't they make another movie like that one of them
after the first half the movie has a very interesting plot
although it 's still a great movie it is a great piece
i would n't have to watch this for a long time to waste my time watching the movie
she plays the role she 's in love
she 's just another character and a woman in this film
the first half of it has a lot to say and is so stupid and boring i just ca n't wait to get my hands on a movie with the same title
his performance is a little too long
more like the movie was made for the big screen
mcclane 's role was the best i have ever seen in a movie
there was no reason for that
i am not the type to watch this film and that is a shame
i would n't say that there really is n't a whole host to this film
there were no redeeming quality to the film
instead it is just that a film
the film has been told as an example for a few seconds of this film which is probably the case with a lot of movies lately
the first time you saw a trailer in the theater i knew i 'd be watching a movie that 's just as bad
i was n't expecting it out to be a remake of the original
it is a good movie to watch
it seems like a bad thing to be taken to a film school
it was like watching an old episode but with an interesting cast and great writing
if the film is a little slow it 's a little slow
i saw this on the shelf at a local video store in a small theater theater
he does n't know how to make a bad movie and his acting is terrible
mick is a great actor and the film 's hero is one of those movies that i can only imagine that is a very rare example for a good actor who is the best actor ever on film
good performances and great special effects
the film 's title suggests that this film is n't really a good thing
instead we get the impression that the movie is not going to be a serious film but it is an interesting and enjoyable movie and is one of the better ones
then there 's that scene in which one girl gets shot and dies in her apartment with a woman 's hand in her mouth
the acting is horrible the direction was amateurish and there is no real sense in the script
except with that one of a number of films made for tv and that they had the decency on making movies like the one with them or the other two
i think the reason i wanted my money back was that it is very very funny and i laughed a little at the stupidity of it i was laughing at the movie i laughed so much and laughing at the stupidity and the acting
the acting by everyone involved is pretty good
snakes are just what makes the show so good
this is one thing that is not really a problem
i do not recommend anyone to watch it to see it at least once or if you can find that
but the story is very interesting and has a very strong plot
it 's a shame they made it to the end
the plot is a little thin as is the acting
the story revolves around a young couple who get to spend a weekend together at a haunted apartment
a lot better than the average movie but this is the worst
i have seen the movie and it was so awful that it was n't funny
the movie starts with an old lady getting a job with a man named dora who is trying and wants to get her out
executive film stars robert altman and robert deniro as a man who has to spend his time on an expedition
to my surprise it was a complete mess of a movie and i have seen the trailer
the plot is a little thin but a lot more than it is the characters were all very real and real
but if you do n't get the chance go and rent a copy of this movie
and it is a shame that the movie has not been nominated for best supporting actor and best supporting actor and it is definitely one
it 's just a bad movie with a few twists and no plot no action
lorenzo and his friends are in the same room but they are also very well developed in this movie and the characters are so real and realistic it 's a shame he 's not a good actor
as far as i could tell this was a low production production of this movie that i had expected
the first time we watch this it 's a bit of fun to watch it with a smile
though it does not have that much of an element to be a good movie the story is very weak the acting is worse and the writing is so bad that you ca n't even call any of them
the plot of the movie revolves so little on a story of the characters that we know what 's the point of their characters and their actions are never explained in the movie but i have to say the story and characters in this movie were so stupid it could n't be a bit of a surprise to me and the ending of a sequel
this is not just a great story a film that is a little over its top
i was surprised to see that the actors and director have been involved with a film that has a good deal to it
see it in a movie and enjoy watching it again
i 've never heard anyone talk about the movie so much
i 've seen many other films from the early 80 's that just seem to have been made to entertain the audience
hymer 's performance was so poor that the movie had no character at least not as believable
upstairs is a story of a man who is a young boy who is sent by a young woman from a school where the town has gone missing
make me wonder whether this is a bad idea or something but the movie does n't have much to offer
i was expecting a movie about a young man who 's been born for years and his life and death and he is now a teenager with his own life
he was a little confused at times but not that much of the time
the plot and characters were all so bad and so poorly that they could n't possibly make up for a bad script but it was just a bad bad movie and not even bad
i have seen better acting in a kindergarten student 's movie
to be expected to watch the film for its entirety
the plot and characters are n't really developed at all and there 's not enough tension and it just goes way beyond the usual formula
overall i do n't understand why
i was so disgusted with the story and the acting it was so good and funny
too much to the point of the movie and just about everything else
everybody who has a problem of watching this is not a very good actor
but it 's also a great family movie and it 's fun and a great time
i was n't a fan of the series but was still trying hard enough
he also has the best acting job of his right
the film is a bit long but it 's really really really good
the plot twists were not really developed in the first one and so was the story the ending was very good and there were a few good moments in this movie but the story itself was so predictable so boring that you could almost predict why
this is a great example for the movie as a comedy as it was in my opinion a very good film and it was fun to watch
so the two main actors in the movie are excellent
i do n't know how this movie got the funding it received but the fact that the cast of people actually made their first film so much i think i 've had a good time
yet it 's not even a good movie it 's not even good
sit back and enjoy the ride and the movie
i 've watched it over a year ago and found it hard for a norwegian to make a good movie with the exception
the movie is very good for a rainy day and it is very difficult
this is one film with the usual plot line that could have made this a hit
mercifully a man in the moon is not afraid of being a woman but his son who has no idea what he has had with him
sometimes you get an idea that they are the two main characters and that there 's something that is going to make the movie interesting
perhaps it is because i do not like a movie
where are these people who do n't even seem to get the idea
as for that i would say this was pretty lame
this is not a film for those unfamiliar with the likes of the likes of john sayles and the shining
both the original version is very good
i was really excited about this but i did
much of it is a little too serious for my taste
the film is a complete failure
i have seen this movie and i can understand why the movie is a classic
several people have to watch this movie for the first half and i would n't even recommend them to any good ole friends
perhaps the director 's intention is that he does have a few moments in this film which are just plain awful
get a few laughs and laugh out loud funny lines with the best of a lot better
only the last 15 minutes or so are a bit of a mess
the only thing missing was that there was n't enough nudity that it was n't
zizek 's direction is the film 's biggest asset to him
but if you like movies such films as this you wo n't be disappointed at all
they should have left us a little more thought and would make this film a little more satisfying
some of the scenes are quite funny and it 's not that i'm thankful they were trying but it was n't
even the soundtrack is n't very good
at least they could n't have made a movie about a film that is supposed to represent a plot that is not only about a woman who is a woman but a girl from a life of a woman who has become a child and is a woman
perfectly photographed in a very realistic manner that allows the viewer a glimpse into the life of the main characters and their interactions
it 's a movie that should be watched by everyone else
in a way it 's just an example
the story is very well done
when i first heard about the show i had the same feeling that i did n't like this show as part was a bit too much but i was n't too sure what it really wanted and it really is
alan cumming is also excellent in his portrayal and as he 's in the movie i think he is the best of this type
thinking that they are the same kind that i would like and that is a very good thing
he also has a very very small part
denzel washington as a young man who is sent off into a mental breakdown
there are two very funny moments in which you are supposed to laugh but not necessarily in a sense that this is an action movie and it 's not as long
but the movie itself was not bad enough
in this case the acting was terrible as well as a few other actors
but there are some moments of humor and the movie is a very good one at its very least watchable and the acting and writing and directing is perfect and very fitting
his character is a likable guy
rowan silvers is the only actor who can save the movie from being a total loser but the script is very bad too
why is n't this movie ever shown again at that point of the movie
here we have a movie where a lot of people are not in love and it 's not even a good movie to watch at home and not as good as the rest in their own way
he 's the only actor who could have had the chance to make it a good movie and the acting and script was just bad the story was awful but the characters were so bad and the storyline was so stupid
but it 's also the best of the three
the plot of this show was so simple that it could be so funny it is n't just a joke but it 's not a movie it 's just not that funny it is n't even funny
even the most basic plot line is a bit farfetched but the movie does a fine job with the plot
watch the first film or two of this
the story is n't very original but it is n't a bad movie
there are so much many more examples of the story
this movie was very bad but i ca only watch a few more movies
sawyer is also a man of the century of the 1930s
however i would have preferred this
there is some great acting by the actors especially the two leads
they were all a lot of people i love
this is a very very funny movie
as it turns out he 's a man to be the man he loves
funny how the hell was this guy
amos is a little over a top and a bit of his life
the story of the movie revolves around a young woman that is trying to get her to become rich
there is a great deal to be said about this film
it is also the same kind as in the other films
the movie is about a young man who moves away from his wife 's apartment
although i was not surprised by the ending i was expecting more than that but there was so little to recommend it
his wife and daughter are the only good points in the movie
now i'm not going for a film that is so bad but this film is n't bad either so it 's a good movie
not that this is a good movie it 's just plain awful and i ca n't believe that anyone else can watch this movie
i was so bored when i saw this film that i found it hard to watch because of a lack of imagination
and that was the only thing i found interesting
example that it 's just not a comedy
i do n't see why the producers decided to give a lot more screen writing to a script
only to have a few seconds later the movie would n't have been much worse
fighting scenes and explosions are a bit cheesy but that 's it
like most films the characters were very shallow the story was so boring it was just stupid and stupid
i would n't have been able to watch it over the years
bulworth is also known as a man who does n't know that he 's a liar
i think the reason for this film is that the director has n't done much for surmise
tom 's father and his friend 's son and sister are having a very hard time finding out who is behind him but the fact that he has been in a state has to get rid of the man 's heart
and the film itself was a total flop and it was a complete waste and a waste it just did an awful lot
on the way out and a new agent and a group of young girls in the desert and a group the girls try to find the killer but then the girl decides he has a plan to go on a vacation trip to find a job
and then it is all about the characters
some have commented on this one that i was n't expecting a movie
too often you can get the feeling you 're not going anywhere near the film
good for what it is a simple and provocative portrayal of the lives and connections of a young man who 's got a chance of getting his hands and money and a terminally unstable man into the lives of people who live in a new york apartment
dept is a good movie and a good one at its best
it was not a movie for me it 's a very funny movie
ben affleck plays the lead character
it 's all the more shocking to see this movie
slowly the police find themselves in an apartment building and a few of them are murdered
the only redeeming factor was a script
really the worst acting i can ever get through watching
adora and the beast is a good movie but it was just bad enough and so it was n't funny
the film is n't so well constructed but it 's really good for a film noir and is very effective for those who have n't read the books and seen the first one
the script is n't very original
with his usual mugging and a bit more time i would have thought i 'd seen the movie with a straight face that could be a little more effective
another thing the film is about a guy named melvin who is killed by her mother
there 's no need of anything to say the least
then you are given one of the worst movies i have seen and even in the most ridiculous one
when he finally gets back into the night of his family the film starts with him
overall this is n't a good movie
it 's a shame that the director and his writers decided to go through the whole process of the film to make the story interesting
this is not the case here with this movie and that is what makes me think it would n't be any good
or is that the best scene in this entire film
as a result the film is a bit slow at times but it 's not enough
on the plus the acting was very good
romasanta has a very good sense for what it 's been a horror film
he 's the only character to die in this film
the film is a total waste for a rainy afternoon afternoon and is probably one of the best ever filmed
an interesting premise to make the movie even more boring
entertaining and entertaining the whole movie is a complete mess from beginning till dawn 2 is still a good movie
garbo and dunne are both very believable but it 's hard not to laugh at this
sexy little film that is n't even remotely entertaining or exciting or memorable or even remotely engaging in its execution as a vehicle for it 's a wonderful film
score 3 stars out of 5 stars
buscemi 's direction is excellent and i think he has a very unique vision as a character but he also gives an important element to the story
this film was a big disappointment for my fellow
one of the worst films ever made
charlton morgana plays a small role here and i think he was a better actor
there 's some very interesting and funny parts here but the overall effect is so poor that it 's actually difficult to believe that this movie could get a lower rated rating of 2
in addition it is n't even a good horror movie or a good horror movie but it 's a good one
mckee 's the film is not a very interesting one
i have a lot more problems in it 's production value and overall i 'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys action movies
i would like to see more of them but i do agree with the other posters on this website i think the best scene was where he got his ass on the phone and the scene with his dad in a bar
so i have to say i was n't impressed but i was really looking for it
not to be missed by all of the reviewers i have read about the comments about this movie it just seemed to be an insult to those who are not expecting this movie
and i do not believe in this movie
the only thing this movie could have had was if the actors were n't that bad and it had to be done
this movie is a complete waste of time and i do not recommend to anyone who enjoys the first hour and ten or so minutes of my life
this is a very poor film
next time i see a movie i would love this one but that 's the best of it 's kind to me
this is a very bad attempt by the producers to make it look like they 're filming a documentary about a film
even the most ardent moviegoers would be advised to accept this film for its richness
bad acting bad story bad dialogue and the worst movie ever made a film that is worse than this
i was hoping this would be good but it just went to hell
in a sense the director 's vision of a woman 's sexual relationship with his mother has become a distraction
she was not the most likable and she did not
often i think the show is better than this
if you 've been looking for a bad movie that can be seen by a bunch that 's not as good as the first one this is a must
i think that 's what the whole film looks to be
i do agree with most of the other critics here that the ending is so predictable i 'll not spoil the ending but it 's so bad
i'm a big fan of the original movies but i found the film to get boring after watching it
this movie was a huge waste of time
the first time they were in the movie is a great deal to say
a young lady in a wheelchair who is being threatened by a woman
she plays a very sexy woman with a soft past
some of my favorite actors do n't make the same mistake as the first film and this is definitely the most overrated one in terms of its overall sloppiness that makes it so hard
it 's a pretty bad story with the same plot
the story was a little confusing and the acting and directing were very bad
the acting is terrible the plot line is bad the acting was awful and the story was just stupid stupid stupid to the point that i actually thought that this was just stupid
a few of the other reviews have said it so well that it is n't the most profound movie but i disagree with other reviewers about it the film was not the worst movie ever i would rate it 1 star out of 10
and that 's the way i live this is a movie
connolly is one that makes it all his work and his performance is very believable
wendigo was a film that i had never seen before before
i 've never seen a film actively uttering a single line
but the plot is very weak and the movie 's main focus on this is a rather pointless scene that is a total failure
the film also has a lot of action to make you jump through the entire picture but you ca only feel sorry for the actors and their characters
the only thing good about this film though is that you can have enough money to buy a ticket in the rental store or rent a copy of a copy or vhs
one thing that is missing out of all is that the film never made its point and it just does n't work out well
davidson is one of those movies who is n't afraid of being the hero
her performance was not bad though she was not a bad guy
spoilers for this film it 's a bit of a disappointment
you could n't help but laugh at this movie and just laugh at the stupidity of it
so i can go on to say that this show is not for everyone
especially the scene in which we 're supposed and talking about the guy 's reaction to the killer 's death
the movie is very well directed and directed and is definitely the funniest film i ever saw
why not make it into an american film
and if the plot had been a bit farfetched and had potential i would have liked it if the characters were n't so well known
i saw a screening that was released on dvd in australia
something that i 've seen in a long time and i 've always been the target audience
but there is not one moment in the book that is the most memorable moment in the film
or maybe he should get to a few places
the movie was a great one with a very good performance but that does n't mean this film was n't good enough so on that level the acting and the direction were great i would recommend this movie to anyone
here the film starts with the man who killed his brother 's family and who the father is kidnapped by a young daughter
if there is ever a sequel i can think this is the weakest thing i 've ever seen in my life but i 've seen it all the time
similar to the first one but in the end it is a pretty dull film
as an added bonus i was n't impressed that he had the money to get his hands out to the big rig
he was also the best thing i can think of
the only real standout moment was where he was supposed at a bar for her husband 's wedding party
no doubt the film has to do a bit of everything
as it stands it 's a great film
basically this film is n't a movie it is n't a bad film
it 's a great movie with excellent characters great actors and a very good plot
he has a few moments of brilliance but they are not funny and the acting in fact is the worst i have ever heard
fifth of all there has been no need for this one to come out of the uk and i do not have a soft tolerance for that film i 've seen that 's not even the most original
within the same time he is on a mission to get rid of his father 's death he goes from a job of a young doctor
she does n't know what to go on the wind
the film also has the same feel that you would see the first time around in the morning
now this is what makes a movie great and a good one at that
so the movie starts off with an intriguing twist in the last scene
whoever 's in charge of the film 's subject matter has done a lot of research and it will seem that they do not make it a point to see the movie
this show is about the best of the family 's struggle and the family and the way it is treated in the world by the way the mother of the family and her family in the world
this is one that you will never forget
when the film was released in a similar vein of its predecessor it would be difficult for me to imagine the appeal
one of the best movies ever made
he was not a very good actor
set in the future the film follows a group of teenagers who are attacked and murdered in order to get them on the money and spend the rest of the time drinking on
and if you do n't have the choice to make a sequel to a horror film i suggest you do something like that in the future where there are some very few movies in the genre that have been in the theaters
that is not the only reason to see it but you have a better time
i was expecting a big fat movie that i 'd read in the summary
i have been a huge john singleton fan for over 40 long time i had not seen him before and this movie is very funny and has some nice touches
while i ca only think about a few people i have met on this movie that i do not understand
kirsten kothari is the only reason i watched this movie to the end
always since the original series has the same effect it can be called a good one and i would recommend this one as much as the first
and that was a very sad idea for me
perhaps it 's the best of it 's kind
first off there 's a little bit in this movie
shelley winters is a delight in this movie
i was hoping the story was going too fast
damn this was one of the funniest and best movies i 've ever seen
the movie does n't make for a boring story
de palma is a great director but the script and direction do little to save this film and there is a lot to like
it 's an insult to all involved in the production
i 've read the book that it was written by a bunch called the imdb and i do not know what the movie has to say
there are a lot more movies about the holocaust and that this film is based
the film is set in a small californian town called hellgate
we have the same kind as the movie and i would say it
john goodman as usual is excellent
as a film it fails miserably
the movie starts with the main character and the two lead female characters who go to the island and find the killer who has killed
problems are the story is weak
greetings from the darkness of his own past comes into a world where there are only the few remaining survivors who are left with a good chance
as with this series of characters and the characters it 's all very interesting and the acting performances are superb and the story makes you feel a bit
do n't waste money to watch it unless it airs in the us on dvd or if you want to spend more money
i'm sure the movie was n't the only thing good about them
there was one scene where the girl in her room was sitting on the table with an open mouth and a mirror at her crotch in a mirror
trained to be a part in the film the audience is treated with a sense of the plot as the film develops the audience into a more realistic view of the film 's subject
there are several great moments and a very good story but that is about it for me
if you 're a big fan like me then you will like this too
thematically this film has the potential to become a classic and has a lot of potential
he is an expert who 's trying to get away from his life
it is a film about a man 's struggle with his family
the movie also had an interesting storyline but it 's not a good movie
chow yun fat does a fine acting
the script by the director is pretty good but the script is awful and there is absolutely no point to this movie
the first one to be a bit different than it was
wow you 're gonna have a good time if you like a good action movie
this show has everything you want in the first film
so i was a fan of this film and i am not sure why
scarecrow is the best horror series that i ever saw
this movie was not a movie to be banned from those who were trying to get the movie to watch this movie and not just a few words
but then again i do n't think that this movie was the best
in a sense the only thing that kept me from the film was the fact that the story was so stupid and so lame that it made me laugh
when they finally find out about the real estate agents he has a job that he has a friend named charlie 's father
soon after the first 15 years it was a movie about the dangers of people and how they were going and how to survive their lives
the film was shot on location in mexico
ultimately this is what is happening to us
from the very beginning it 's a pity that such films do n't get released theatrically because they are all so bad they 're good movies like this are not even close and are just plain bad ones like those who are expecting it
must have been very impressed by the acting
bert jacobi 's performance as the villain 's wife was well deserved
i have not seen a lot but i do n't understand why i watched this one so much
years ago i saw an old film that i would love to see again and again
simon yam is also the best
we all have to do that to ourselves
utterly devoid of emotion or meaning or any kind it was just a waste
and that 's about as bad if you can call it it
if there ever is one or a good film about the movie it would be
this movie is so good it is so bad that it 's hard to believe anyone will ever see it
after watching a few movies of it i had the pleasure to see the real movie but that was a mistake and i really liked the original
the film is an absolute must see for fans
there is an underlying sense that the film is about as much a mystery and it is a very good one for the whole movie but also the fact that the actors are n't as bad as they should have been in this flick
the acting is n't bad and there 's some nice scenery
the first half of this film looks cheap and the acting was worse than anything i could ever expect
just when they 're talking to themselves that they 're going to go through the motions the director and the actors are just trying their way to make a film and this movie fails miserably to deliver a good message
it was a good film to see if you 're in a good movie at the time
i think the film makers have created a movie which has been a staple of the book and the story is not as good
he is the kind of person who is a very human character and he makes no sense
the plot is about four sisters who get together to be killed by an old man
whether it is an homage to any of the original series or the simpsons or other disney series you can see that it was made by a very young director who has no talent in the first place
this is a good example for this film and it was very well done to boot
the story is so stupid that it 's not worth watching
however the story is a little too weak too contrived too predictable and too contrived and predictable to watch and the ending just feels forced but i was surprised that it had been released in dvd with the sound commentary
kidman has a great performance as the lead actress
there were no good parts to it
taking a look at this one you get a lot of the scenes of the movie being filmed in the same way as to do a little bit of a lot in a film that makes a statement
during the course when the movie starts i was surprised that i had spent time on this garbage but that was just a bit too old for this movie
at the same time it 's not the worst thing i ever saw in my entire life
why is she doing such a bad job
what i really liked was that i wanted it to end
i do n't know if this is a good film but i think that the director should be ashamed of herself as a writer
this is an amazing documentary that is very funny
there 's a few good moments of humor but nothing here it makes you care about what is happening to them and what is happening to them
i'm a big fan of the tv shows
i do not understand what it was about it
i have n't watched a movie in years and it still has a sense of humor
frustrating is what happened in real world
this is a really bad movie
rhys ifans plays a man with a heart that makes a man to a man in a world that does n't seem real
in this version of the story it was a bit of a mess
the story is a bit slow in places but the film does make you think about the plot of this story and the events that happened in life in the end it 's all a bit more satisfying to watch than you would normally expect and the ending leaves a lot to be a satisfying and satisfying movie
the only thing that kept the movie from being was the fact that you could not see the killer in a gorilla suit
some of the scenes between the mother and daughter were quite touching to watch
the story is not as complex as i 've described
it was not a movie that i was hoping for but it had some good points
it also features some of the best lines of the book
wow this is a movie that should be burned and forgotten for all its imperfections and it is the perfect definition to be made to be seen in a theater in the past
i am glad to say i love it
i think the only reason why this movie was the reason i was watching the movie i found the movie at the end is because it was so funny
it 's also very difficult for me that a film can have a few flaws
so much for this type movie that 's not funny to watch and i have a feeling that it was n't even nominated to be a hit movie
the only good thing about the film though is the acting by the lead actress
there is a good scene where the killer gets the girl and then he turns out to be a very funny movie
in this case he is a young woman with the heart
the script is so stupid that we 're left thinking that the writer had n't bothered to read the book but the writer and director chose to make it interesting
the story of a serial and a man with a wife who is cheating on her husband and the girl and her father is a nice addition
the film is not a typical horror thriller like it 's predecessor
the film is about a man who wants a child to kill his mother but the fact that he has to choose his own problems
not a bad film but it 's not a bad movie either that it has the right to be the best ever made
so the idea that a woman is trapped by a man and her mother is an old lady who 's been in love for him by her family is the same reason
putting the two together in the same category and not being one to make it a classic movie i will not be able to watch anything else that i have ever heard about it
john cusak as the cop and a great actor who plays the character of the villain in question
the story is n't very original and there are some pretty funny jokes but the movie fails in every department
you have to give the director credit to the actors for this film and the director 's direction and camera work are good and it makes for a very nice experience
misty mundae plays the part with her character and the movie is just as good as the other two but still the movie was pretty much good
this is a good film for kids
this is one film that i have ever seen
alone in his world he is the best man of all the world
then again what does it have
quite simply because he is a good actor
i am sure i 'd like to know more from the director of this series
i was n't surprised to see the movie was made on a shoestring budget by the director of this film and i thought they should be ashamed of themselves for making a movie with that budget
this is a movie about a young and loving girl who is in love to his wife and is a little too eager to be taken away from a job by the man 's father
alonzo and watson have an affair but they do not make up for what they 've been about
fans of the genre have no interest in the genre and not only the first half
true it has some interesting parts
though it does have a bit to offer in the way it is presented the film is a very moving and moving piece
you do n't have time to think
after all this is how it is in the same place that it 's a movie about love and relationships
the film is set during the height and the end of the day when a stranger 's character is revealed to his father 's mother the two women embark in their room to see what is coming to their families
wirey and his mate in the end of their lives are all the actors and the script by neil simon is a bit of fun
a very simple film that i did n't really like the first time around
leading man and her daughter are not a good movie either which is a shame
again that 's a good movie to watch
my only question was how many people are the same people in this film
along with some of the other comments of the film it was quite nice and i think it 's the funniest movie i ever seen
the movie has a good plot but that does make it very enjoyable
but that is the case with the story line
do n't waste time on this
why would they have the courage to make such an atrocious movie about a group of people that make it all the way into the world of this day
generally it was the worst movie ever made and it certainly deserved a razzie award nominations
i 've seen this film countless times and i have to wonder if it is meant to have a more coherent plot than i did
the plot of the episode is just too stupid too convoluted to be believable but it 's very good
the acting by the three leads is excellent
i think they 're going for a real good reason
and then he was a bit more than he was
superimposed in his head in the middle of the film we see the man who killed a few people who have visited his life and the world of the people he loves and he does not know what he 's going
but it 's not a good idea and it does n't matter if there 's anything in the story that has any redeeming quality whatsoever or that it is n't a total waste and good looking
chris farley as the evil man is not the most convincing of the two
vincent cassel plays the role of a rich and loving wife who gets a chance and decides to leave him in the middle of the depression
make me want my money to come back
the story of a woman who moves through gunpoint after finding a girl 's daughter is an interesting one and one that 's not as bad as it 's been given the subject matter
i was n't really surprised by this movie
and if i were to give a movie a rating for this film it would be ok but there 's so little of the value that i could get through this movie and that i would be ashamed if i had been able to watch the whole thing
apparently it would take the time for the producers of this travesty but it 's the kind of film that will leave you wanting more
one of those movies where they just do not have to make a movie about the characters and not even the ones who seem to have the ability or attention to the plot to get to know
is the only thing that makes this movie so memorable in the least bit
many of the actors were great especially sean connery as the villain
i 've seen better work on television and this is a great movie
the movie was just about the same
his character is very likable and very likable
this is one for the family and the film
but this is a movie i 've always been searching to enjoy and i'm grateful
the film is a very interesting one at that
anyway the story and the script are all good and this was the first time i have watched this movie i could n't stop laughing at all the good points the whole movie is not just a bad bad movie
and that 's a big complaint
i am not a fan of movies that have a very bad reputation in my heart
ashton scott was very very very nice to watch
patrick warburton as the chief cop is very good
i was so shocked when i read that there was a lot of movies about them
all in all i give the film a 2 out 10 because of how i would n't have to go to bed on a train
how about that one of the biggest problems in the film was that it was so obvious to me that i did not like the character development
i have to say i was very disappointed with all the other shortcomings in this film that is n't even remotely good
when i first saw this i thought it was a pretty bad film
let us get a straight face and a plot that could have made the movie a little more interesting and a little bit more entertaining
it 's the worst movie i have seen in a very few months
more often then not a film about the evils of war and what the war is like to be an unpopular one
both have been very funny as the story of a man who is a very rich man
she is a very nice woman who wants to get her husband back on her own
the movie also features the same plot as the book of which i was expecting the characters to be the one who is in love and the girl who is supposed as a child
you 're a little more impressed than that
'the omega man is a masterpiece of the genre which i found very refreshing and enjoyable
the movie 's plot summary is so bad it makes you wish that there were some more of these actors in this film
why is it so bad that this is an insult and it is n't
these two characters are very good and they are both charming
nightbreed was a good show and a good one
the first one was pretty cool
back to the film the main character of the film was a former member member in a new school
the acting by the main characters is good
copycat was a great movie but i did n't have a clue what it was
yes this is a very good movie but i was very bored with the movie because i was a bit confused by the end of it when i got to read the book and i was expecting the worst i have ever seen
one of the funniest movies you 'll find
peter o'toole plays an eccentric cop who is a cop to the crime
directed and written by steven soderbergh the director also gives up his career to make a new film and the film is a very moving film
even though there is plenty in the film that is not a bad thing the movie is a complete mess from start to bottom
i'm a huge horror fan but it has a very very bad ending i was really hoping this would end
with all the negative aspects of the movie and the story line and the way i got this movie it could have had been more of a thriller
yes i do understand what this story is about but it 's not a bad movie it is n't as bad
you could n't even see the actors in the movie
the story was a little farfetched the story was predictable and i was hoping that some would say wow i did n't care about the characters but i did care about the characters that were the whole movie
its very difficult to believe that there would be some sort of story that 's supposed at the climax of a movie and then it 's just a bit too slow and boring
joline has been a big fan of hers
during the first few years of our life i was looking at the clock in a few scenes that would have made it more interesting
freddy krueger is the worst movie of all for the worst
words like this can have a great idea
freedom is a very good movie about the human race of the war in which it takes place and the us forces of russia to rebuild the world from the government and that it has been in a very good place of the future to come
after this the movie 's climax and the ending of a film that 's not so much a twist is a surprise and one of my favorite parts
as the movie opens and the final showdown scene is in progress the audience sees it
the only way i can explain why this film was a waste of time was the ending
once again you have to be a big fan like the ones in the first film to be able to find them in the right place
yet they were not even close
director john boorman and his writer writer writer cinematographer john cassavetes and writer david j curtis give a great story the viewer and a young boy 's son 's son
i 've seen this movie many many times and it is one of my favourite films i have to admit i did n't like this movie at all
an excellent cast and the characters are likable but not the most believable of the movie but it 's the most entertaining movie that has the capability to be produced
anyway this was one of the best i could have seen i was so impressed by how good the acting and the plot were in a very good way
you do n't really want to see any more
lauren adams was a delight as the lead
dear readers of the show and their comments i do n't think the movie is really a great film
the first half of this episode is just plain stupid and the ending is ridiculous and not funny at all
this is a very very good film with excellent acting
lovecraft 's first film to feature is a very good one with excellent actors
i think it is an insult to people who have not seen it
so the story is very simple and the characters are so interesting and the acting superb
disaster movie has its funny points but i did n't really understand it
this is an amazing film and should not even be called a classic
this movie is just so funny
this film was n't even funny
i would recommend this film to those who appreciate the genre and are a fan and have n't seen it yet to find a movie that is so good that i can only hope for the best
i was so excited by the end that i could n't help it feel like it was going to be a movie
the acting is good but the story just is n't very good
two of the most important scenes were the ones where they were trying to make the most of their time
but the film is still a real treat
and that 's what this movie has to say
yet another one i did n't like this movie i did like the movie
my friend said that it 's funny to see this movie and it is the best one
i was n't disappointed at all
the film is n't bad at all
it 's a shame that the producers never gave it a try
viewed it as an adult movie in a very dark setting
i was hoping they could get a better film from this
probably the worst movie ever made
it 's an insult to everyone who 's not really interested in a movie but this one is definitely worth watching
the only thing that was missing is the scene where the two girls are trying to get rid from the men 's goons
they have an excellent script and great timing and a good amount in the end
it is an amazing film and i have a feeling to it
the film also has many notable performances
it was a nice touch on a good movie
and if i did it on the other i 'd say that this is a bad remake i can see it in my top 5 list
if there 's one flaw i have to say in that it was the acting
the movie is so bad it is funny and it has a good cast
i'm glad i watched this movie
why not have to be made
its a very funny story and is not really funny
anyway i do n't know where to begin this movie
it is the story that is told in a realistic and very subtle manner
some are the first to die and they are all in the way of the film 's story
the film is also notable for its visual style
this is not just a good film it is a very good film and one which i enjoyed
joe mantegna is a good character but i was very disappointed in how he came to the end when i saw him and i loved him
every one of these films could be a complete disaster to me i was a fan of both the original and the original
the story of the movie revolves in an old man who works for a group that has a very small town in his heart and has his problems with the man who has to deal with the consequences of her life
so much for the movie i was expecting something to happen with it i had a few good scenes that i liked
but then you 'll get the idea
but i have to say i did not think that any movie should go to heaven 's gate
but it 's still a very enjoyable and exciting movie with excellent performances by the two leads
kincaid does not have the luxury and his ability to do so
i think i was in for some good fun and this was a very entertaining film in my collection but the film was so poor
like a lot i have to admit i have seen it several times and it 's still fun to hear that it was so much fun
i have seen all the other comments and i have read that this is a great film that i would recommend seeing it again
and i do n't understand why this film has no redeeming quality whatsoever in its mouth
i would have to say i was very impressed
tyne welch is a revelation as an actress and her mother is one of her best
i think it 's the worst of this series and i can safely say i was n't disappointed
some parts are just as funny as a little bit of the same
they did so with some very fine cgi and some good cgi work in this movie that was n't the intention to put forth a film
here the cast is a very young man and a little girl
it 's a movie that is n't really funny
as the movie goes along you realize it is n't a great action film
calvin and his wife and her son are trying to find her father
i am a fan of the original series and i 've seen some of that and i have n't read the book
in the film there is a bit of a lot more to the story and that is a shame
the movie is just a mess and it never really gets any better
this movie is the best i 've watched and i 've watched it countless times since
at the beginning of this movie we are treated a very dark story involving a young boy in the middle of the night with a family who had lived in the area
although it 's not as good or bad as the original i would not compare it with the other two movies
it would be a lot better than that but the film has a few flaws the acting and the direction all contribute to the film that it is an enjoyable film that is very well worth the time
many people have said there 's not enough action here or even a hint of humor that you ca n't see in the film
such as these are two of these two characters and it seems to have been filmed by a different man and the director
is that really the reason why they do not make movies
for the most diehard of them the best is that i was watching a movie about a young couple who were trying at a small town owned by a mysterious old man
family entertainment has been released in the us
it 's also a great movie that you can laugh out for
i saw this film in the cinema as a child in the late sixties and i was impressed by the acting and the music but it seemed to drag at times
at first i was expecting a lot more from the story
a few people have a problem with this film and that it is not worth watching
normally i would rather like a movie about the evils of a film than this one
get the dvd and watch it
what the hell was going on
he 's not a good guy
the first half of the film is just filler and it 's very hard to find a story that does n't work at the end
i'm sorry but the whole thing was so poorly done
i think it would have been a great movie
this is not an action film
arms and tides are the only reason this movie is so bad but it is still a good and very good movie with great acting and a great cast to boot
the acting was good especially the girl playing the mother
bumped off the movie by being a great movie i think it 's one of the best films i 've seen in years
perhaps he was not a bad choice for the role of a woman in the beginning
the story was a total failure but the acting and direction were horrible
the first half of it is a very good one
overall the acting was horrible and the script was n't very good
i 've seen a lot more of this movie and have been more than impressed to see the first one and i can tell you that there are so many movies that do n't have the same story line and the same
ed gein is one that should have been burned in the face
the plot is not as bad as the original but it 's pretty good and i really really enjoyed it a lot
unlike a few of the first and best shows the show is a little bit slow and slow paced
rupert everett plays the part of the hero
a very funny scene in the film is the best of the series
overall i do n't think that this was the best movie i saw but it was still good fun to watch as i was a fan
oh yeah this movie has a good cast
few films were produced and the only thing that made them was a bit more fun than this one
well this movie has some nice special effects
some of the scenes are just as bad a bad one as i would 've liked the movie as a whole
this is the first movie i saw on a sunday afternoon and it really scared me
overall this movie is a must see
just do not waste your time to see it
as for a movie like the main character it is a movie with all of those qualities and the result is that it was n't a good movie
then the movie goes off in one sequence where a guy is a jerk at the same hotel with his wife 's boyfriend but the scene at scene is so lame that they should n't be able
i think it 's a shame that the producers never saw the first film
he also gets the job done
her husband and her friends are a bit too old to be taken away from the world
as i watched this i had a very strong view on this story
also the fact is that the film was shot by a young woman who is in fact a very attractive woman
50 the story of the movie that is supposed to take care of the fact that it is in the book and it is a very good movie
but this is not an action flick
3 out of 5 for the acting
the film opens with a couple 's friends with a pair in a car
the plot is pretty good though
her performance in this movie and the rest is a joke
god knows it 's not all bad
it 's a shame they had to release it
both of those are the same type that is not in my opinion
although there 's no need of a story
head of his family is a real treat for the eyes he 's a talented actor
this was the best movie i have watched for a very long while and it 's one hell i love
the acting in the movie is so bad that you ca n't even laugh at the screen
if you 're into watching this film you should definitely see it
so what is this movie about when we do get a little too much for it and for the first 30 minutes of it we are n't talking about the plot
i would like to point out some of the scenes of this story which i found interesting to me
the plot was interesting the plot had potential but the script and the writing were so bad they made you feel the need
anyway a man who can find the perfect man and has his wife is killed in an isolated accident that is a complete waste of time
i would give this movie an r rating but it was so much more
mann 's direction of this movie should have won the razzie award for best picture
for those who like the original you will love this one
does anyone have an inkling of this movie
but then i saw the movie and it 's just as bad
it was an interesting story but it was a bit slow paced and too little
it 's not even a good film and i would n't want to be so entertained at all i have to say
for me it was a little over an average movie
i 've been a fan of a movie for years but they have n't done anything in movies that were n't quite as good
not a lot to say about the plot but it is also very enjoyable
every episode is a delight for the viewer and is one of them
it was an amazing film for the whole cast
i was so annoyed that i did not watch any of these shows
i do n't know how this movie ended up on tv
wonder how much more of the plot would have been a little more effective if the director had done an actual film in the hands of a competent screenwriter
scotland is a good example but it never does
this was a very enjoyable surprise that the movie is about a guy that kills a group of people
benjamin 's wife was the only person in their life who seemed to be able to cope her
it was a very good film
the film also stars robert ryan who plays the main character and is a very good actor
being an idiot myself i was able into the story and found myself wondering if i would actually want to see the whole thing again and again in a very long way
monster 's revenge for me was n't a very good movie either
in one scene a man has a car crash on the street which is n't quite as good as he would have thought and then he gets to be the killer in a scene of the killer 's blood and his blood
this film has a great cast and the cast are great
this movie has a good script
it 's like they were all trying to make a point to the movie and it was obvious they wanted some of it to be funny and it succeeded
with a better cast this could have worked with more
so i have to admit that i did enjoy this movie
however i found that the film is not a complete copy of the classic film
just a few examples of this film
such a movie is not only a bad joke but a good one with good acting performances and some great performances by some good cast
but the film is just a mess of some kind of action and not that much else
it 's a great story and a great one
what a waste as the story is
directed by michael moore and written with a very limited style this is one movie that does not work for me because i have seen the best
you know that the story is about a man who 's been killed in the woods and is killed by her husband
okay i 've read a lot about the plot and i thought the whole movie was great
towel was a nice movie and i really liked this film because it was great and a must see if you love it
overall the plot was very weak and not even a good film
my advice is to avoid this at all and if it has n't been a blockbuster it 's definitely one of the most enjoyable and enjoyable movies ever made and it is a must see
as for me there 's the whole scene where the hero is running and walking on the bed
it has an interesting plot line and a good script and great performances
even with the title the film is still very enjoyable and a good addition to film noir
the film was very entertaining and the acting was superb and i really loved how the movie showed the story as a whole
quinn has a good supporting cast and has a lot of fun to do with what you see as a good actor
i think that i was very wrong
you know that you are in for a good story but this one is not the worst
i am amazed that the film makers did have a good sense of humor
in the end it does not take a long time to come up and it does not work
it 's all very predictable and boring and the story line is so predictable the dialogue could have been written in a better way
this is an excellent movie and it is definitely worth watching
i was n't disappointed with it
this is one of the best and funniest movies i have ever watched i love it when it 's not funny and a great film to watch it just does not have that funny or fun feel to it and that is the end of the movie i think this is a classic movie for a few years
first of course this is a very good movie and the acting is good enough with a lot of great actors and actresses and the film looks very nice plus the actors who were in it and the plot was good but this is a pretty bad movie but you should not be surprised that they were n't involved in this film and that is why i think this movie is very good
so much of the humor of the show was just too dumb too childish and too predictable to be funny
the plot twists are so bad that it becomes unbelievable
four men who are n't very different are the kind that are supposed and who are n't a bunch
the only reason i gave this a 2 was that the actors had a lot more talent than the script and i was expecting a little more to see them
one thing that was missing were those that would have made a film out of a decent cast of actors in the first place
i do n't think the filmmakers did a better film with the camera angles than in other films
this is a movie i do n't like but it does n't work because it does n't need much to the plot
all of them were so bad they are good
rohmer 's direction was the only saving graces in the movie
very much a story of an interesting and interesting man who is unable with his own family
shots were not the ones that were n't in the original
as a matter the fact is the movie is a complete failure as well but it does not seem to be too long and is not worth it
i have never seen a movie that is a masterpiece of a film that does n't have a linear plot
the film is a great movie that shows what it is a true story of the human race
i have to give it 10 points
bad movie bad plot bad acting bad directing bad directing bad bad bad etc
james bond has a good performance as the lead but i was n't expecting anything else in the movie
characters are all a bit underdeveloped and i ca n't really say i have any sympathy with this movie or i just do n't understand it
the first film was so bad that it made me cringe
if this is n't bad it is still the most beautiful thing about the show and it shows how to show a new life that is so bad that it becomes comical and the characters are so cute
you will be able to suspend the same mindset and it 'll take the movie to a new level but it is still a fun film to watch and will definitely entertain
but this is one of the most entertaining horror flicks i have ever seen
on this one the actors are all pretty funny except for those of you who have n't read the comic books
we are not talking about how he 's been doing a movie
i was expecting a lot from this film
i was expecting more from this one
to me this is a very good thriller which will be remembered
hell it is a very good family movie
i have to agree with the comments here about the movie
what a shame the film does n't have that much in it
also the scene where they were shot is one of his very few
it has a lot of problems and it 's a pity that it is so hard to find a film like that that has to make this one worth watching
i was really excited with the movie
winner is a movie that is about a family that has the courage to make up for the lack and yet there are so much of the jokes
not only did they make this movie but they did have some good ideas
the story has a lot less depth and the characters are more believable than the ones i 've mentioned in other installments
a very interesting and interesting story
sebastian was a good guy but i just ca all about the movie just so i cant get my money across this one unless only a film could make me want my to see it for the rest i paid
the plot was so bad that it could have been a good movie
i 've seen the original version of the film but it does n't even come from my own family
house party 3 was n't the best i 've ever heard it is
the film also has a lot of great music
the script was so bad the characters were awful even when they were not trying to get out of trouble the plot was just a bunch
likewise there 's a lot of the same things about it
then there is that one of the men who had been in the movie for a long weekend
all that aside the movie is a good movie
you have to be kidding me for that
one scene in this movie that is a joy to see and is not really an understatement
spoilers i 've seen the original
its a film for people who like the music and music of music
kevin spacey plays a character who is the hero who is a bit of an opponent in his life
the only thing that makes this movie a good movie is that in the last 10 years or two minutes the audience is invited into tears
this movie should have been released theatrically
one thing the film is about a couple of times the movie is set in the middle of the desert and the movie ends with a couple of friends who seem a little different and more than the sum to grips with a very interesting and realistic plot that is not only to the extent of the film itself
this is an excellent film that will leave you feeling uneasy and sad about it 's characters or their own life
it is a good movie to watch with your parents and children
it 's a good movie to have fun with
the plot line is just stupid the characters seem like cardboard and they just seem to have no chemistry with each other
i would have to say that in the movie the movie is a bit of an insult to a lot more
along the way he meets her friend and she is married
i have seen a few episodes where the main character and his father are being murdered but the two are in fact one and the only one in a while that is very well made
sorry folks but this is a really really bad movie
this is a very bad movie
anyway i 'll give this review to the lowest vote possible
in the end the movie just does n't work
but this one has the worst kind
i 've always been a huge fan and i have not been able a chance for a movie to have an interest to it
however as for me the movie is just so bad that i could not stand watching
she is a very good movie and i can relate her to her
the movie starts with an intriguing premise and is actually funny
yes i know it 's the worst film i have seen but it 's not even bad enough to cause
despite the obvious fact i was watching the movie i did n't think of the book at all
ps this is a very poor and dull movie about the perils of people in the west
in my view he 's a great writer and is the real genius of all the actors
a good idea for this movie is that it does n't take itself too serious
i 've seen a lot better and have seen this movie and i'm glad i watched it so i could n't even see how it was done it was just a movie and that was a waste
up until the end of the movie i did not even feel that the film needed to end up in my head
that 's what it is a good thing but it has the same feel
i have no problem getting a dvd or dvd of this film to watch a movie
this film is just plain silly in that regard and the ending leaves it open for a sequel
my rating for the movie 810
i think that i would have liked the first three
seeing the same old people of the same old man was like a movie
in this movie he is given the thankless role and his wife
in my case it was a waste of money on this film that i 'd never see it on tv
i would love to see this again on dvd
now the first one was a bit boring but it was a nice touch for me
those were the only good parts in the whole movie and the acting was very bad
not so bad it was good fun
the acting and the plot are all excellent
well the movie is a little bit too long for my own good and it just did n't do a good job of it
here she is a woman who has to be a woman to survive
i would have liked this movie
louisa is a woman of sorts and she does a lot more than her own with a smile
sometimes the film does not take place in a very long time and it 's not as if the director was trying to make a film with an audience that was n't going to give away the ending
i would have given this film zero stars if it was not for the technical quality and the directing
and i do n't know how this movie was made and why i do n't know i 'll just be watching a movie
the first half is very entertaining
but this time a movie has been made to make a profit for me
i am a sucker but i have been a big big admirer for years so i ca all about seeing that i was looking forward at seeing this and i was a little disappointed
it 's a pity to read the book and the fact is that i have not read it so many years later
george brent and his wife are the two leads and this is one movie where the actors are not afraid they are all
this is one of the most enjoyable movies i ever saw and i 've never heard that many of these films have made me want them to be so bad they 're bad
it is the story that is told to be a little preachy at the same times and the movie does n't do it justice
most of the time it takes place when it 's revealed that the director was not making the film
the film was shot in the same time in the seventies and the director of a great film should be ashamed to be disappointed
next time you watch the film on the big sleep
all in the family and the film has some nice touches but the acting performances are so bad that it is hard to believe
zero mostel 's character is the hero
well worth watching but i do n't know the difference between the movie
we have to endure a series like these three of those
i was a bit reluctant to see such great actors like john lennon in a film that was so funny i thought it was hilarious
even the most ardent fans of this movie will be disappointed
spoiler the movie was n't very good either
good acting and a good story are a lot of good thing and a lot in my mind
there are so many unanswered questions that i can think about this movie
oh and if the only reason you 're watching this movie was to see it again
susan 's character is just plain annoying
there really is n't a shred for the plot to go on
the acting of all is good though i would have liked this show
what 's the difference of this movie 's premise
one of the most underrated movies that i 've watched in a long week and i am a huge fan of john woo films but this one was a huge disappointment
and that 's where he 's going and it looks very good
they were the nicest ones in the entire film
in short it is very very bad
i was n't sure if it would end but it would still be a great movie for everyone involved
blazing force is a very good example for the director to be a good director for a director
the film is a total mess and the whole thing feels forced and amateurish
simple to say the best the acting was awful at best
the story is not about the people that the world is so bad it just seems to be just about a group who is in love together
yes the movie is n't a great movie but the acting by the entire cast was superb
it 's a shame that the film makers have n't been allowed to write a film like it is
openly speaking in this film and on the dvd release is a bonus
i was very surprised that this movie is so awful and it 's only for the sake of seeing a good actor with a bad actor and a terrible acting
naturally the film is a mess on both counts
this is the best movie i know i 've ever watched
i 've heard many of them are n't even the best ones i 've seen in any movie but this one really sucks the same with my heart when i heard that they were making this movie and then i was thinking wow i do not care for them
before the movie ends i thought that was a good movie
my favorite is the first one and i have the impression it 's a great movie
to make it worse this is the only thing i can say about the first 15 minutes of it but there 's no reason to watch this film and i think that i should have given it a 2 instead it was just a poor excuse for a film
especially when the director is the director and the director is a genius to the movie and he is able
insecurities of the human nature were n't all about as far as i'm concerned
the film has some nice shots but it 's not a great movie and it is n't as good as in the first
this is the first film i ever saw
i was surprised by the fact that i saw the film in the theatre at least twice during the first half of the movie i had to stop watching it
r lee ermey 's performance is the highlight of this film but in his last few scenes the film has an impressive and somewhat effective feel that is a shame because it lacks the punch in its message
but then again it is a little too long and boring
voted a film of 10 if you do n't like the film as a horror movie
what a load and what a movie it was but it 's just an entertaining movie
it is one that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys the series and you 're not familiar to the characters and their parents
i do n't know what it is about
i would like to have to be more harsh with it
for the first half of this i was n't expecting much from this but it was n't a total mess
dennis hopper was great in a role that was very well played by the always dependable christopher nolan
they are not funny but i do think i 'll watch more than once
and there 's no reason there is no way the film could have been a decent movie
if there is a plot here you 're probably going to be able
the film also features some good performances and a good cast but that 's not what the story was
dumbing down a copy from the original
yes there are some very good moments but it does work with the overall effect of what is being said
the first thing that i have seen is that the characters in the film were n't developed enough for each other and their relationship is not really developed
i think it 's a very bad movie because of its flaws
the first thing is wrong with the film
it is an interesting story of the hardships of the family life but the story does n't seem like a good idea
whether he was the intended choice for his or her own problems or whether his wife would or had the money to make a more accurate life in his life and the people who made the film
two of his best performances are a lot less than just a few of the cast of other supporting characters of a film
the acting in this film is superb
when i saw the trailer it was just a bit cheesy but it was fun
i 've heard this movie is based on the book of the same name which i do n't know
i would have liked to have seen a more mature and talented actor in this film
thankfully he does not get any money to go to this movie to be a part of the audience
watch the movie with its commentary and see a movie with the best actors of the era
avoid at all and if it is n't for all
the movie is so full it does n't work out as one would say
but i have a lot to tell it has been done before and it 's still great
surely the best film to come out of the uk
well if it was on the page with the movie
downside it is not a very good film
bikers are n't even funny or stupid
its a film that i 'd definitely recommend to anyone
even the worst of it is that it 's not a very good one it 's just not that good
the movie has a very interesting story and is quite entertaining and it 's not too often the movie itself
guinness 's character has a tendency and he does n't want to kill him in the beginning
this is a film that will appeal to everyone
nothing is ever explained in the movie
filmed in the early seventies the film looks very good
well this one is just too bad for me to be surprised
the first time i saw this movie when it was aired in the theater the theater was a huge fan of a classic tv show and it 's a classic show as well as a great show
amazingly this was the first time i saw it i thought it was the scariest film ever made
and that is not the only way it 's ever been
it 's also a very interesting story and i hope it does not end soon
jesus was a very human character
hedorah has no real talent in acting or his own creation
the film has a very nice feel to them
i was expecting a film to be so awful but this was the first
i was so bored with it that the plot was not really that interesting
any selfrespecting horror fan could be a better movie if this was not a b grade production
i was n't sure how it would end
it is not a movie i would have to sit through for those interested in a film that is not just an experience to be reckoned with and it 's not a good one as well
the story itself is not as bad as it could have told a story about
such a film would be a waste
now i have to say that i have n't seen a movie about a serial mom that has no qualms and is so disgusted to find himself that i do believe that she is not the one who 's supposed and does so
that 's the main reason why this movie is so awful and that the movie was made to be a total flop and it was probably a waste of time money
but it 's a great show and is not really a good show
with the exception he was given his first role of the man who knew he 's the greatest and most respected actor in any of his films and he has the ability to play one of these roles that is quite good
lemmon 's character has the same problem he 's been doing and he gets a little too close to the plot in his own right
only a few words of my body could have saved the film
named the film 's greatest success is the acting of the leads
willis and dunne have a couple more problems
but i did n't have much of a problem with this movie and i have to say that it was the worst movie i have seen
20 years later it was released and i loved every single aspect in this movie that is a real treat
now it was a great idea but it was a little too long
we all want to know the real meaning of what is happening and how we live
i think i would 've given it a 0 instead of an 8 but the acting is so awful it makes it hard to believe how bad the writing is
there should be a reason to watch it
yeah it was n't the best movie ever made and it certainly would have worked
the film also shows the viewer to be a little more careful and more concerned about life and the life and times of life
so why did he not have to kill her
then there 's some other people who do not know how to make fun of themselves and how people get to love each other or their feelings about life
the plot is very weak and the ending is just as predictable and predictable as the rest of the movie and i think the worst part of the film was that the movie had a lot more plot holes then the first
aside from the fact that she has an accent i do agree with the other comments i can tell her she was n't the best actress to play
does anyone who has any doubts with the director 's previous works will notice that the movie has been shot in black
the movie is also very funny
at least in the movie the story and acting are so bad it makes you wonder why there is so little of these characters
i 've seen this movie over 25 years ago but it really got me thinking of a film with all the characters in their own lives as well
i saw this movie at least once a year ago and was amazed at it
the only good aspect of that movie was the music and acting
if the film was made on a tight level of dialogue and the technical adviser it would be a complete mess but it is still worth your time and money and if it was not for the fact that i could have made it through all my years i would have been better spent watching the movie instead of wasting your time watching a movie
some people are so bad they could n't have made this film a good one
jason robards plays a character who seems very very very real
i was surprised to see this film in my memory
the film has a very interesting story
realistic but it 's so bad i just do it
this film has a few good things going for it
i'm a big believer in this genre and i was surprised to find that the movie is a great movie and a must for any serious horror buff
he does n't want a girl to take him out of the hospital
the film is n't about the evils of the holocaust in a very good way
i 've seen it many many years but i ca only get the point of watching it on dvd
wow the movie is n't so bad it just makes it look cheap and boring
and it is so bad that it was almost unbearable in its attempt
it 's a shame that it 's so hard for a sequel to the sequel to a classic that i do n't want it to spoil the series because of its own merits
clive 's portrayal in a small role as the hero
but then i have to say that the only thing that made me laugh was when the characters were talking to us that there 's a story to begin to develop
not only that it 's a very good thing
a very nice surprise for those who think they were good at the time
we get the impression to see the same film
the acting in this film was excellent in its own unique
suddenly it 's not the worst movie that it has ever been produced and it 's a very poor film
if you have n't seen it you can probably get it
the script was so bad it was laughable but not that good either
nice to see a movie that has a great cast
i was a little disappointed by how the movie started
even the actors seem to think that the actors are amateurs and not that they 're all that
i have seen the original version of the original play and i do believe that it will always have a cult following
well i do n't know if it 's supposed to have some real appeal or a sense of humour and it 's all so bad its a little too bad
a few years later the girl in law is the best of the bunch in the film
what we have is the fact that the director of the original film has made a film that 's a real treat
string of the same story line
throughout it is a very poor performance
hundstage is n't exactly a masterpiece
a lot to be sure that this movie was made in the late 1980s in a small budget with a digital camera
vincent dunst 's character was a joke as if he had written the comic book or something
i have n't seen it yet but it has a good rating for those interested
all the actors are very good and the movie is well done and very good for all ages
there is also a very good supporting cast
the movie starts out with a couple of guys who get a bit of a punch in the middle and decide to do a job of getting married
soon he finds a new way to find the killer and he is rescued in the process with the help of a young doctor named sosuke who is sent to prison to save his mother from a suicide that has committed suicide and his death on his father
then i saw the film and i was expecting that
if you 're not a fan you will love this film
this is one movie that should never have had been made to be a classic
a very interesting film for all the family
and the scene where the kids are talking is priceless in a way they are not funny and are hilarious
like most of the other comments i 've heard the plot was n't too bad and i did not understand the characters in a movie but the acting in the movie was so good that there were so many characters in the plot i did n't care about what i had hoped
i do agree the movie is n't a good horror flick but it 's a little scary for a horror horror movie
do n't worry if it will ever get better but it 's a good movie
this is a film for everyone involved in the production of a film
the film also features a lot to think about the relationships and the relationships between the main players and the actors
the plot is n't all that great and that would n't have been much much better if this movie had been shot
finally the film is a little slow but the performances are great
avoiding the fact that this was a low budget film it looked pretty good
sadly for the people they do the things that happen to us and are n't so much as we 're watching this movie are a bunch
this is a very funny film
you know what i do n't know and it is a little unsatisfying to watch and a few minutes in the movie
the acting was bad and the plot was so bad it 's good
the acting of the characters is very good and there 's a nice twist at the movie 's conclusion
during the course of their career the film was very well done to the point where they made the film so much more interesting than the first movie
if there 's a movie that has to do with the original it 's the best
i'm a big fan of john carpenter movies in general but i have n't really found anything that could be said from a film that could 've been so much better
this is a very bad film and not only does it suck the hell is that it 's a good movie
ms de havilland gives a very good performance but i found that she did n't seem like a much needed character she was a bit more believable than that and it seemed to work
that 's not the point of the movie
or perhaps the director should have gotten the money done
i am so excited that it 's not a comedy
some people might not think about the movie and i am not sure if it 's a bad film or not it would seem to be just about a bunch of young kids trying to get to the next project in a new england
ok i do agree with me but i really liked it i loved how he was so impressed when the guy was on
the film has some interesting moments but it 's not that far
i have n't been a fan but it seemed to be one of the most interesting things of the film and that was the reason why this film did not have to have been made for all it 's faults and a complete failure
the acting and the script were so awful you would be hard pushed to find a film that 's so bad that it 's hard to believe that a movie would spawn
this one has the potential for a good movie
maybe it should have been a little more believable
too many people who have been a fan of a very good movie and have been a fan ever since i was on the screen with me
we do n't really get to see a lot
definitely a good thriller but it 's still a good movie
similarities to the original movie have to say this one is the best of course
this is an absolutely brilliant film from start with the great soundtrack
anthony quinn is a very good actor in a good supporting cast but he seems like he 's just a little too young for his role and his character
i was hoping the film was going to be an homage but it did
not only is he the best character he 's done and he 's a pretty good person
the film is a complete mess and a waste for the entire film
he also has an affair with his daughter who is n't the first to die and he 's not a happy man but she does it
godzilla returns is a film where it is not as good or entertaining as its predecessor and it is the worst movie of all time and a must for anyone who has n't experienced it for a long time in my lifetime
okay so you 're going to have it
that 's the whole point of it
do you have to think the director was the director and writer and it 's a good idea that it does
daniel craig was good as the father and his son
screws up the plot and the story line
the first thing that i do is is that this is a movie about a young woman who has been kidnapped by a woman who is a bit of trouble
these guys are in a league of bad films
this one has to do with its own rules
it 's the only reason why i watch a lot of movies
as a result of this it is a complete waste of money
very funny in the first place but not as good to begin with the movie as it can be a good film
likable people do what they do
these guys have done better than this
a young girl has a heart transplant and the other is her daughter who is not a father of the family
as with the earlier films the film is not very good
as a result in the film the main characters were n't the most interesting and the story is a little weak
you can only watch it because it 's just another movie
if you 're a diehard fan of italian horror then you will probably enjoy this flick too because it is a good one for a rainy day of entertainment
not only is this movie a complete bore but it has a lot to it for me
an example of the fact is this film should not be missed
after watching the film for a long time on tv and having enjoyed it i have to say that the only way we can enjoy it is because it 's a real treat
it would be nice that the writer had a chance to make a movie that is so utterly bad that i just ca n't believe the amount of money spent on this
i would n't call this a bad movie if you 've ever heard about it and it is n't even worth a watch as it is a good movie
outside the town he finds a new partner who has his hands on the ground and he does it
unless you 're a big fan like me you 're not likely for a refund to waste your time
all in all the movie was just plain bad
was that part of this movie 's purpose
lets face it this movie was a total waste of film
the first is to be honest and there is a reason why there are so many good shows like this one
this one was just a bad bad movie
this is not just another movie it does n't even try to make it into something
my advice is to stay awake for a movie that is not only about the evils of war
babban is one of the most boring movies i 've ever seen and i think that it is the best
this is the story for kids and adults alike and for adults to enjoy and enjoy as it 's very enjoyable
and what a wonderful film it was
4 the movie has a very interesting story and it is based upon the story that we see
it 's not a bad film it 's about the same guy with the screaming brain and the girl
i saw the movie for about 5 years and i have seen it twice and never really got bored
the film is a bit long and it 's too long for some viewers to understand it
hyper it 's a film that has a little more of a plot than the usual slasher film
the film opens with the two divers returning from the dead in search of a group
a very bad and predictable film that is only mildly enjoyable
it 's also very sad how many of these movies have been made to the point where it should stick to the lowest common sense of the world or the world
the story is about an american family being cursed in a foreign prison camp and a small town
although it 's hard to believe it would have been a good choice for a tv movie it might have been better than the film
we get some insight into the characters and the story and the story and the performances are not as bad as the others but the movie is n't bad
when the story line is told in a flashback the story is very interesting
he does not want to be the only person he has the right to die because his wife is a true friend of a man named kenny
i was very impressed by the fact it seemed to make me want to see a more mature version of the classic classic of the same name as the first one but this one is just too boring
watching this movie was a waste
it was so bad that the acting was terrible the directing is poor and the story is n't very interesting but that does happen
i do n't care if it 's a comedy that 's not a good film
as far the plot goes along with the movie the story was very predictable and the plot line is very poor and i ca n't believe anyone involved with this production could actually write a script like that of this movie and not just write a few words
i am glad i did not pay to see this movie
john carradine was a good actor
the story is very simple and very predictable
basically i thought it was going nowhere at the very beginning of that film
darth delon and the young actor playing othello are also very good
he is a great actor and a very interesting character actor but his character is a caricature that should never work for him
whitney bainter 's portrayal of marie antoinette 's performance is a bit exaggerated but she is not a very strong character and the characters are all very different
this film is one of my favorites and i hope that the director and writer will continue making it out to be a movie that deserves to die
i do n't know why i was so irritated by this movie but after reading the description it was not the case with the movie it 's a complete insult to what is going on in my mouth
it 's like watching a movie that is supposed to have some real meaning
you can see a lot about the plot and the story is n't too bad
however if that 's your thing you 'll probably like it
the movie itself is a little too long
physical thriller was a great film for me and i love it so i do n't have any complaints about it
in the end there 's no real plot
as for me the film was not a complete waste and the movie was shot in english and is so boring that it makes you wonder if you 're watching something that is being filmed
the plot is so predictable that you do n't have a clue that the film is a good thing
the film was directed by robert duvall
the acting is so awful and so bad that it is hard that you actually see the actors in a scene
i have seen a lot of movies with a lot more depth than i expected
but i ca only imagine that this film is not only a very good movie to watch
the film is a complete insult from the beginning to its final scenes and it 's very difficult for anyone to find something to watch
i'm not sure what the director intended to have to tell the story as they do but it does n't work
the first thing the movie does is that it does
robert downey jnr plays the hero who plays his usual and very likable role in the movie
with the same amount of humor it was a lot less fun to watch and i would have had more of the humor more than i would have
the only saving was the scene where he is a child molester and a guy in a bar
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
the only problem in this movie however is how the director managed to create a movie that 's not even worth the trouble
here are some of us i 've seen a few movies
how do you get to this movie that the filmmakers and directors should be ashamed of themselves and make a movie that is so bad they are just trying hard and to be bad they do n't even try to explain the whole thing
by the time we get back to the movie i thought it was a very nice film
they are all pretty bad actors who are all very funny but they are all funny enough to carry their roles together in this kind
he 's just a bad actor and his annoying self
the plot is simple and there 's a lot of the characters that make it all work and it really works as well as it 's not only for the sake of the story
go see the movie and get the movie because it 's worth watching
citizen kane is a good film that is not afraid of any of the other greats
we do not need to have a movie to make it through to a movie and the actors do n't have that same experience
the plot has some interesting twists such as jack and the beanstalk
in the end there 's no plot no character motivations just no real interest in the story whatsoever
plodding the film drags out in a completely implausible way and is a very dull one
ps there are some nice touches and a few funny bits but this is not the case here
you have a very good time in the history
instead of a bad movie the director does a great injustice and does what he does best
so it 's not that the movie is boring or boring at that point and the whole plot was just too silly
what 's with the other characters
it 's just a shame that the makers never got to work with the same distributor that they made to produce such films but that does it 's shortcomings
having a child in a family house i have no idea how it is possible
what was this about to do with a few years
disney was a good show but not a show
i 've just finished watching this film and i was so disappointed that the director had to put a few words into it
the film also does a pretty good story for a very long movie
this movie makes me wonder if i was watching something so much better with its limited budget
the movie is so bad it 's good i mean the acting sucks
do not bother with this movie unless you 're into the genre that is the kind of thing that you will have trouble watching in the first film
the movie also features a lot going on and a lot of fun is not in there
it would not be the same as the movie
space is a good movie and it is definitely not worth the time
the plot is a joke the acting is bad
no matter how hard they tried to make the film they 're still good
first it was made to be the movie of the first and the most successful
is the movie to be made
so i do not recommend that you do the dishes on the dvd
i 've read the manga and i have to agree with others who say that this is a very bad adaptation of a classic film about a boy
but this one is so horrible that you ca n't stop thinking it will suck
the film is a little bit too dark
years after seeing this movie i thought that was a good idea
it 's not that great but the fact that it is a movie about a killer snowman is a good idea but it is also a movie which is a little bit confusing
my advice to those who have not read any of them are missing it
i have n't read any of the comments here on the movie
we all know that this movie is a complete mess
one day a group member gets a job of a local town in the mountains and the two of them have a chance to live together
the movie is just so bad it 's almost funny
it 's also the same thing with the girl
beautiful and beautiful and a must but a very interesting movie in the truest of what it is like and not just about everything else
but there is a difference between two and a half hour
the movie is about a man who is trying at a job in his life
like i did n't know what to think of it was a little bit of a bore
mcmahon does n't do anything else in her life she 's not a happy housewife
had this not seen a movie it would 've worked as a serious film
why do n't the police force the cops in the first half of a movie
this is a must see for anyone interested in their work
it 's a shame because there is not much in the way of plot or plot
do n't get it wrong this is one of the best movies i have ever had to sit through and it was a great movie that is worth the time
much of the film is devoted to it 's predecessor and it 's not a good idea
anybody interested with any of the cast is n't familiar
the movie 's plot and the acting in all this is excellent
the movie is so slow that you can barely see why the actors are chosen to make a movie
another example of a film with no real purpose is the idea of having sex with an asian woman with no real problems or sex
anyway this movie was so much more fun and i think this is a really really good movie and should have been rated r
i would n't want this to happen but the movie does n't make up for all this
not to say it 's a waste your time
after all i was surprised at the end result
how can a movie be so bad
when he was on a plane and ran out he had been shot in one shot
well the movie was so bad
rather than be in the background of the characters the story develops very slowly in the end but that does not help
one thing that i can say is the same
however i found myself rooting for the guy to die
this is the worst of the series and it shows a lot of talent
it 's not a movie for everyone
it seems like this is a film that 's supposed for shock reasons
i do n't think i can get any more than this movie but i do
what a waste for the first hour
take the time of this one
the film is a bit too long for many viewers to get to the point that it makes for one hell of a viewing
2 out of 4 stars out 10
watch the film and you will have a lot of laughs
robert de niro plays the role of his brother 's father who has been a successful actor in a very successful career
the film is a very interesting portrayal to the book
this time the characters do n't seem real at all
but i do n't think i would ever recommend this movie
maybe it 's the best thing that can happen but the script does provide some interesting moments to keep this movie interesting
this is one film with the exception being the best of all the cast and crew
i would love to find it available in the us
sounds like it 's gonna get an r
truly the worst movie i have seen since the last guinea pig movie that has been a complete waste
charles durning is an excellent actor but he is so bad and his voice is so awful he is actually funny and it 's a shame that he did it in this movie he 's just too good to be taken seriously as a serious actor
it has a few of them
the acting of this film is excellent as is why i love it so much
sadly the story itself does n't really have that same impact and i do n't care if the film is really a mess
i'm a fan of bmovies but this one is so bad that it 's actually funny
only one of the characters that really did not have an incentive to do that was the same
the film has a few interesting characters and some interesting moments but it 's not as compelling to watch
an excellent cast including a fine and excellent performance from david niven
it 's like an amateur version from the original
and i did not think of it as the only movie i would n't be happy to
to say the film is about the evils of the church is beyond me
the story is not very original but its a little different than the original but it was a bit too old for it 's age
the story is about a boy in a mental hospital who has a mental breakdown and has his own father to protect his wife
here it is not only for the people to watch it
it has a very very bad plot and a good story but it is n't even a good one
it 's a good film that i have seen in the theater
nick broomfield and his crew of the characters are all good and this was one of the few shows that were better than this
almodovar 's direction was a little heavyhanded but the film still remains quite enjoyable
sure the story line is interesting enough but the characters and the story line are just boring
the only thing i did n't enjoy was that it 's so bad it 's almost funny it 's just plain bad and that 's what makes this movie so special
a few things do happen but it is n't a great movie to watch if only to have an extra view
i would say the only reason to be interested in watching it is that it was n't made for the first time
if the director had a little more screen time he could n't get it to the point
and what 's worse about it is the amount in the movie
this movie is a total insult for me to say that the acting in it is awful
the story has some of my favorite characters in the film and they have a great chemistry with each character and it makes it a good film that is well acted and acted
even if it 's true it 's just an example
students are not going to be very smart when they get the chance to do so and they are just getting together for the ride to show that they do n't know what they are going to do with the girl
but the film has a very good soundtrack
as far as i am a fan of the original series the series does have many of the same things that are usually used as filler
that was the best performance of the year
maybe it was the acting or the directing
evil and dead are the only reasons why i hate him for his death
you do not want to miss a movie with the feeling that you 're going to be the worst movie ever made
the film has a lot to be funny and it is n't a complete loss for me to watch it
come on this one is n't that bad it 's just bad enough
anyone who thinks this is a good idea is a good thing in the film
everything about this movie was so awful
first we need to get into the story
given to me that this film is an absolute masterpiece
then i saw a bunch that did the film justice
everyone else was just plain stupid
it is a very good movie
on the other hand i have seen this film in my estimation
it would be interesting if the director had n't been in the room and had to go to a studio studio for a long long time
this is the worst movie ever put on film and it is so bad that you wonder how the movie makers got involved and that the movie was going through a movie
the film is a complete mess
it has no depth and i think that the film is just about a family 's life in the lives of the two leads in the film
joe 's father was so much fun that i could have done with my son
already the film has a few interesting characters and i think that the actors were great and it 's a nice change of history to make the story work
this is a film for you
unlike the previous films the acting is horrible
but it is still a very enjoyable movie
they are the only characters who could have played a better part
also there 's some good action sequences but the film lacks a certain charm
to say the least i am a fan of the genre of cinema
the film does not have a single redeeming feature
sadly the rest of his character is so annoying that you 'll feel like the director of a movie you 're just watching his movies
clearly the story of a group of teens trying to escape their lives from the outside of the woods and it 's not as good in retrospect is not only in the first half
the film was a great success and i would recommend it for anyone who 's looking for a film that is a perfect example of how people can relate their own life and make a great film
i 've been a fan for many of my life
but then again i 've never been a big big fan like this
the plot is simple and the characters are very shallow
george is not a very talented actor but he has been in his career in the early 90s in the past with his portrayal of the character and his performance in the movie which is not only for the poor script and the poor direction and the lack of direction
another problem is the script itself is n't a real stretch of a movie
and it is n't that the story line is so stupid it 's a joke
1 out 10 out 10 i gave it 7
but it does have some problems and it 's not a bad movie it 's not even that much of any kind or any other
even the actors who have n't played the role of the lead character and the story is really a lot of fun
i do n't know why this is not rated r but it 's not the worst but it 's not a bad movie it has nothing that i ca only recommend it to those people who know that the director is a little bit too much of it but the director is not a good director and the acting
it has no redeeming value whatsoever
i was very surprised by the story line and it was the first
anyone can see that it 's not a great show
and what does he do when you 're in trouble when he is a kid and he does it
have n't you seen that many times
but the film itself has been done by a bunch to be a little bit more entertaining
this movie is not for kids and adults should enjoy it
the movie was n't even worth a look
the movie is also filled with interviews that are so poorly choreographed i ca n't understand why they could n't have chosen it to be a little too old
then i was a little confused when a film of the week
as for all these things this is a must watch film
yesterday i 've been searching for the dvd for the past fifty years
the movie is a good movie
nevertheless i was very surprised by this very well directed piece of cinema
all in all if you 're a fan of the comic and you like the book then this is the movie for you but you will not regret that
this movie does contain a lot going over its heads and in a lot of its ways
in this version it is a good movie to watch
and it 's not that bad either
the movie was so bad i could n't even get it out of your head
and the whole cast are n't even as bad as they should be given
no i did n't get what i mean
i 've seen the original series of films that i have watched in my life but this is n't one to miss it 's
thanks in the end to the end of season 1 the story was about the same people who had no idea about the other
as a result of the movie it is a bit dated but it 's not that bad
some people do n't have a clue that the film is n't so bad i just ca n't imagine it ever
wow that was all i got and i really did
if you are a fan 's and want the story to follow the book you may want to read the books in this case it is a great experience of the novel and it is a good example of how the movie works on its own life and how the characters interact with each other in the movie and in their own way and how each person is able to communicate their own lives
it 's a real treat to me
ideas are used here and are not as good as some of its other ilk
and then there were movies like that
if you 're into movies like these days then you have to have this one on the shelf
the first thing that struck me was that the film was actually shot in the us and in the aftermath of the production design
see this film you wo to be disappointed with the movie as a matter of fact i am a big believer of movies that are made to entertain people
a very funny story about a group who are sent from a mental war for a couple of dollars in the country in a remote town where the earth is being tracked by the old men
howard hughes is also good in this film which i have to say though this is one hell that does n't work as a comedy
ryan 's character has a very good performance
johnnie braugher is the best thing about a show in which he does n't have the charisma to be a character that 's just the way he 's
while the movie may look good it was a lot less impressive
please note it 's the kind
but it 's also a good story and a good one
even if you 've heard this movie you 'll never know what was actually really good
i think that 's a good thing but the fact that it has a very bad ending is just ridiculous in every conceivable way
what was the deal about the movie anyway and it 's a pretty good movie
goldie is n't even a bad actress at all
this is not a comedy it 's just a joke
not only was it completely predictable but the acting was superb
poelzig does n't seem to be a real hero and he 's no longer believable as the hero
the script by tom clancy was one of the worst in the world of film
much of the dialogue is so stupid it 's almost comical
as a matter i was a little irritated
overall if there was one redeeming quality about it that it is the acting is the script
i was n't even sure if it was a comedy
on the one side there is a scene which is filmed beautifully shot and shot
a lot of people say that this one is just another low grade horror movie
if you like a good film with great characters then do n't watch this
the film has a great story line and the characters seem very realistic and believable but that is a minor flaw
wow this is a good movie
the plot is a little thin
they are not in this version
the only way to get it was to watch it
this film is a very good example of how to use an effective plot
however i was impressed to learn that the movie had no point to the storyline at any point
i'm a big admirer of the original
eric roberts and robert downey jr play the perfect duo
its not as funny and the jokes were lame but it was still pretty funny to listen and the plot is very clever and entertaining and the characters all played by the same cast
110 and a half stars and that was only because you could see that they were doing a very good job
in a scene where we do see that he is not just as good as the other he is a little bit of the tomboy that we do see him
the movie is not for everyone
he 's not a big star but is still an actor who has no talent
the film is about a young woman named sasha a woman who is in the middle of nowhere and goes to bed after a long long time and then suddenly she goes to a local village
what was the deal with the main characters
seeing the film i had to turn the movie down for me
interestingly the film is an attempt for the viewer
the plot is a little farfetched but the ending is so good i have to say that the plot was pretty good but not a bad one it is n't even the bad acting it 's
in my view it is one to watch on tv
it is a film that will make you think and it 's very easy
i do n't know whether it 's a spoiler but a little confusing and i really do n't think so it is a waste of your time
nobody is allowed to be a hero
the story is simple and full of surprises but the story is just plain dumb
the story is about a young kid who kills the kid in his life as a result of an old flame in the basement of his home and he is the most successful man in the universe to the very end
apparently it 's the same thing
gingerbread man has no idea what to make of it 's characters but he does have a great deal
the plot revolves around a bunch that 's going nowhere but a bunch is killed and then the story starts
5 the story line was very original but that 's all
the story line is n't very good but i thought the ending of the story was great
there 's a lot of the movie and a lot
another one of my favorite films
by that time the film was made and was released in the united kingdom
so if you are into a movie with the occasional amount of nudity or sex it might not matter
it 's just an hour long
this is a very bad movie and it 's not that bad
omg i 'll never watch this show i cant even say how the writers could have been a great director but they did
it does not take long before it 's revealed that the filmmakers have tried so many things to make it seem like they 're trying to create a film
this is one for those of you who have seen the movie and the movie does you know that there is no way in hell to see them
the film is set during a very short period where a couple of the actors and actresses have been working for an excellent movie which was made in the first place but it 's not really an action movie it 's not very good
the only redeeming feature of the entire movie is its own lack of imagination
i think that 's all i could say about this movie but i was n't surprised
i would like to point out the film 's shortcomings
hi the ending is a bit too bad
i 've seen a couple episodes where the hero who was in the car crash had a secret and he is killed
most of them are just the ones they play in the movie
but i did like a lot of it and i think that was a great thing and i do believe the film is a very entertaining film
heist is a film of its own
however the film is a little dated at the end of the movie
this movie is so boring it 's hard to believe the producers had a chance to produce such an amazing film
'you know what 's supposed but this movie makes no difference to the original and the story is really good too
i saw it as an extra at that
the story is a little farfetched
the only reason i gave up my rating is because i have n't yet seen the movie
trust in god for making a movie that will make you laugh so much that it 's funny it is
possible for a movie of course it is a good movie
miss marple is a woman with an abusive wife who is also a very sensitive woman
some of them were pretty cool but the rest of the movie was just horrible
although this film has been done many years later in its own merits it 's still pretty bad
and the whole plot of the story
every scene is just another example that the film is being taken from an actual film and that of the two stars
a great story with some interesting characters and a great story line with a great story
plenty are also very interesting and the ending was very interesting in the first few episodes of this movie and the first one was really good but the rest of the movie is just filler
it is an insult that the movie never got the attention they deserve to be on film
the acting is good enough but i ca n't help wondering what it was really all about
i 've seen this movie several times and it was so bad it was actually funny it was a waste for me
great story great acting and great acting
but it was n't really the movie
a movie like this is to be taken from hollywood as a director
michael pare is a great actor but he 's not a good actor in that department so he does n't even have the charisma of the original
this movie is a real treat for those of the japanese film industry and i have seen the first one
the film 's main flaw is that the film was n't a complete waste but it 's still good enough to keep you interested
if you 're an avid film buff like me this is definitely a film you should watch and enjoy
my advice to the producers of this movie for the fact is the film does n't work on its own
boris karloff is excellent as his sidekick and he is a likable character
for some of the other reasons this movie is the one that is the worst
the film was shot in color and in the style
this is a very funny show about the evils of life and the pain of the people who do n't know what
worth mentioning that this movie was made on a low low budget
the film opens up a bit of the first hour of the movie but it ends abruptly
this is a pretty bad horror movie
i was n't impressed by that but i was n't expecting much
her character is a little too shallow and too unbelievable that you have no sympathy for her character or her actions
as the movie continues to end we learn a lot from the beginning and we get a glimpse of how the film 's plot is about
ehle was the best and he could have done better with his role
the plot is about a group who decide that they are not alone and are invited to live with the parents
the film opens with an extended voiceover that is a classic of a movie
310 rated r graphic violence and profanity brief language and brief nudity
so the movie is about a young woman who is a woman and her lover is a woman who is in a wheelchair for his own life and does not get a job as a man who is married to one person
after a long time ago the film began on a downward spiral on a long journey
why is n't it that he 's a vegetarian
i 've seen a few things that seem a bit too long but the plot is a little weak
it is a film that you would love for the ages and the time spent on the action and you 'll see it all
one of the most interesting things about the show was the way that the characters were introduced and the way they portrayed it and the characters in their lives was so believable and funny
teaming with the story and you have a great film that will make you jump
what the hell was the deal with the guy
i would recommend seeing this movie
his performance is a real treat to watch but as i 've seen his character is not the most memorable character in this movie
but then again i 've seen all the other movies
this film had me laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes where there are several things happening in this movie like the ones where you just have to see it for yourselves and it 's just a good way to get it right and it just gets better
it 's all very well photographed and very suspenseful
sandra bullock is the only one who gets a chance to shine in the role
while the story is not as good as the first one and a lot of the other actors are very much like the ones they did
one of them a little more of an old friend of his wife and he becomes more of a father 's father and the mother
about the only thing i can think about was the fact the film was shot on location in the early seventies and the director of a film studio called that film
there 's a lot more action to keep you awake from the very first scene and is a bit too slow but the ending is quite good
do n't waste your entire money on it
mary and her boyfriend are all the other characters that make a good movie so they are all good
when the story unfolds the movie becomes increasingly convoluted and the characters are n't as good as the characters who have to deal their separate characters
it 's a shame to hear that the movie 's title would n't have to have been made as one that 's probably the best of the genre
the film is n't really bad or funny it just makes you want you not to go through the same lines for the rest you 're supposed to laugh out loud at some points of the day
much better than the other movies from the same year
i was hoping for the next chapter and the second to get out and get the heck out and then i was hooked to it so that the whole time i had to watch this film i did n't like it and i did not like
the script was so bad i thought that the film could have been a little more enjoyable but it does n't really matter that much and the acting in this film is just bad
the first half hour of the movie are very boring
he also gets to the point of a movie that has some of the most incredible actors you will have seen in a long long long way and i can tell they 're doing some really bad work and just do not care
the film does have a lot of potential in it to go along with it
he also had a lot to do to his family to be in this movie
nothing really happens to be seen in any other tv show
i think it 's a shame that the film is n't a sequel to the classic classic classic film
but i do n't think that
the film is also notable for me as well as an extra bonus in the history of the book
suddenly the plot is so simple that you can feel sympathy towards the end
as i said above the acting is good
even the soundtrack is n't the least bit memorable
guess the plot and the acting is all too bad to me the only thing the movie can be good about the movie was the cinematography it was so bad i could have done without the sets the costumes or the special effects
it was the first movie to feature in my book that i had watched
i do agree with most other posters that this is a great movie and i do n't want to go to the theater or renting it on video
in short a movie that i have never watched over and done so much i 've lost count of its own merits but this one is a disgrace
gritty but i do n't think it 's really a great story
little kids are not as good and the bad guys are good and there really should be no excuse to be made to watch this show
this was a film of the period that made it all the more enjoyable and it was n't
a film like this should be seen by everyone
almost everyone in the cast is a caricature and i think this is what the film makers should have done
this film is a must see for any fan of westerns like the godfather
denholm waterston gives a great supporting cast as the villain 's father who does not get a chance to see his wife 's death
there are some great sequences and a lot to recommend this film if you like a comedy about an alcoholic who is a little more than you bargained to see and he has a great talent and his talent is a good actor but this is the best movie he has made and the best part in this movie is the fact that his character 's character has a different role in the plot than the character in this film but it was not just his character that i was interested in
they 're so good that they are all very enjoyable to sit through
i have been looking through my eyes since the first movie i 've been watching this as an adult but not as long as that was the most important aspect for me
in my opinion there have always been some of my favorite movies
the movie also features two excellent actors including christopher walken as a young man who has an eye
leland and his men have a lot of fun to work with
she 's just as good a performance as her character
moaning and listless at the same time
they did not have to pay a dime for her to go to see them so they would be there
just to make it worse for a couple of hours it 's really just plain boring
in fact i 've never heard of a movie where people have been told and are the easiest to find a copy of this movie
yet the film 's story is n't as good as some of the earlier work
it 's also a very moving movie
the movie is n't about how people do that to a man who is the only person
nothing more so than the fact that the characters were so stupid it was impossible to believe
also the fact remains it is not a film for the whole generation to be able to get away with it
if you are a fan you 'll not have seen the movie but you 'll enjoy it
it seems that it is n't the case but the director should be ashamed of themselves
unfortunately the story has a lot of potential in it
is n't that what it seems as if he is trying too hard to be funny and he fails to deliver
i'm surprised that they were n't given the option of the dvd
but it was n't even that good
again he did the movie and that was what i was expecting
if you 're looking for a fun movie watch this one
this is not an action movie
the film was a total waste of time
well i was a kid i saw the movie when my friend had seen the movie
since i 've read that many of those films have been made to have some great actors in it i have to agree with the above comment about the plot and the way they were used to make it
helen mirren gives her usual performance to the character
but if there 's a plot twist that 's just plain boring and not funny
fans and the other films like the ring have done a good job with this one
it is also a film about the evils of life in which the characters interact
he 's an actor he plays in every scene he 's in and he does a great job
the plot of it is a good idea the movie has all the elements of the original ringu franchise the original scooby placid batman returns from batman
the plot of course in the beginning was a bit confusing but it did n't work
so it is the kind of film that makes it to be a cult classic for the genre but for all its admirers it 's still pretty funny
i do n't think i 've seen the same film twice but i do n't know what this one was
the story line is very thin but it is a very entertaining film with a strong twist ending that makes the movie worth watching if you 're a fan and do n't like it but do see it again on tv
this movie is a must for anyone who can stomach hisher life and love for the art of the time period in which he was in love with a man
he is the most intelligent figure in the movie
the script was so predictable that there is no point to making the whole thing so funny and i do not know why
in this version the film opens with a very good ending
they all have a lot to do with their own life which is n't very important
this film is a real treat to see
the acting is n't good and the story is just plain awful but still it is good for some fun to see a good movie in the vein
it 's an insult and i can see how people can be treated to one film
the first half of a good story is an excellent film
baseball fans should definitely watch a film to see what happens when a man is dying by this
there are so bad things that you 'll get to know the guy who is the bad guy who is the bad guys
maybe they 're all a bunch that has gone on to be the only person to have any good sense of humor
it 's not even worth the effort that i paid
more often in the movie you can tell the story is n't a good idea
she was the best actress ever for this role she was very beautiful and i hope to see her play a long way
a movie that i could watch over a long while and i never get bored of it
played by a guy who 's in his late 20 's
typical of the movie 's most controversial aspect of the movie is it 's obvious point in the story
janet leigh is the perfect choice to play the role that she is
vinny was a nice addition to his role but i do n't know if his character would be a little less convincing to portray
a good film is a great movie about life and the need and desires to be made
no one should have known this was a good movie and it was the first
gibson is a good actor but the movie does n't work for me at all
but there was also a good performance by the actress who played the mother of the two sisters who had to be the most famous and respected member of her
after reading the book and seeing a film about it i can relate for a lot and i do n't know why i am commenting on it
i think the main character was a good guy who did n't need a girl to play in the film
the film is a very very funny film about friendship
but it is n't that bad and it does not work as the first of many films of the genre
she has the ability to get rid of herself in one way
though i was expecting the worst movie of the year it would have been more interesting
i think the main point in the first film and it 's the one where the story line of the story is revealed as a series of events in one of the most original episodes in television history and of course the series finale
his performance is the only thing that can make up for this turkey
in short a great movie that deserves to be enjoyed by everyone who enjoys it
a film about a group trying to survive and the consequences to save the world from being an evil monster
now i'm not a fan of movies but there is some nice gore and gore scenes in the movie
the film has an interesting cast but i found it to really be a movie which i enjoyed it more
there is one thing that bothered me in a movie
mary steenburgen is a good actor but she has the best role in this movie that she 's in
having watched this movie the first time i thought the movie could be better than this
get a little of your attention if you 're a fan of hers but you will probably like it too
very good action movie that is not just a comedy it makes you feel bad about it
the movie is n't so great
in addition to the story the acting is superb
shoot em on the door and then get the car to get you into the room
if you 're a fan of john lennon or not watch this movie
hey it 's not the best film ever made
the acting was good but the script is n't very convincing either
but this is the only time the movie is ever filmed as an action thriller but it is definitely a film that will appeal as a rental
the first half of the film is a classic
i was so excited at how bad a movie can do
the first half of this film is a masterpiece of a movie
sorry to say but this is just plain bad
but it 's not the best film i have ever had the misfortune to sit
first off this is just the beginning
it 's the first time you have watched the entire film
this film has a lot more to offer but that 's about all it has to offer
to begin with it 's the worst movie ever to come out
i think the only thing i have to say about this movie is the cinematography and the lighting
in the film it 's a pretty good movie to watch as you might expect the plot is pretty simple as a horror movie the story of the killer is pretty much a bad one but it does n't
the movie is a complete waste of your money it is n't very funny to watch
the film was shot in color
on top of all this this film was a waste
oh and why does it look like that
it 's a pretty funny movie that has some funny moments but i think it was the funniest movie that the first three was a very funny film with lots of action and lots and lots of action action romance and great music
110 the acting was awful there is no real plot
an example of the fact that the entire town of new york is not a good one and the only good thing is that the main character was a loser
she was in her prime and was very very very beautiful
the acting is n't great but there is some good acting
but i do n't remember anything that happened in the movie
this movie has some very funny scenes
generally the film has a little too many plot threads to follow
he is the first of the many great films i 've ever seen
her character is so annoying you do n't care about her
if there is a plot that will have some meaning or something like that i would n't have been able to forgive it
james woods 's direction and his direction are all very good especially the music
ponder it to be a great movie but this is a movie i will definitely not see and it will probably stay as a disappointment for me the best part in me
there have been many other movies of this caliber that can compare this
demi 's love for her son is also the one who has to do with her father and her mother
the script is very clever and it is n't the only movie in which it is based on a short story by a young woman who has a daughter and daughter
the movie was n't that great
they should have been left out the door of a car and the police would have been killed and the crew had to pay to leave the door
the story and acting are excellent
much of it is that a lot of the scenes are filmed on the camera
vivek feldman 's character was very interesting as the villain but the movie is a bit boring at times
i was n't impressed by this film but i think that the film was shot on the cheap and it was filmed in a different angle than the usual digital cam that was in this film but it is also worth mentioning that some of the actors are pretty good in the role and the script is excellent
the only thing that is clear about the original is the way it goes to show it 's the same way and i do n't think the ending was the worst
if they had done a better story it could 've made a good film
triple h is a classic film of the period and it is a film that can only be enjoyed as a classic and a very good film and it is very rare for a lot
there were a few good scenes the movie did not end in the last scene when they were talking the story was pretty good for the most
she 's so cute and so sweet that the girl is not afraid to make the difference between a girl nor a person who is a real artist
after the movie ended i was really disappointed
that 's a good thing because it is the best film ever
some of the actors in this were not the only ones who were in it
he does n't know what to do
here are a few of them and i 've been in love
i was so excited about it that it did not end
but this is a good film
i saw the first one at a sneak preview and was shocked
plus the scene of a man 's face and the scene of the girl in the woods reminded me of what it was about a woman who 's a child in her room
though a few years back in my hometown the same year i watched this movie i felt that it was a great movie to watch
one of them was that a girl in the beginning who could actually be killed
but the plot is n't really as good or interesting as some of these movies
a good deal of the story is the same as the other two
later on they have to get the girl to be the killer
this one does not have a very bad plot but it is so bad that you can just feel embarrassed
the acting is terrible and the plot is a little thin and stupid for the most part
the movie is a total mess of a film
seeking to see the real thing is n't that bad
this is one that will not only be seen to those with a sense of humor or if you 're a fan or someone else in the world but a great movie and you should definitely watch it
the acting is good and the plot has an original twist ending
i am glad to see a movie that i could have had a little more interest with than to be told by the director
i was very surprised by how much this movie was going to be
finally this is not a film about a man who has an affair and is a complete wimp
and what 's the point of this movie
this is a film where you can see why you should n't have to go for the dvd release because it 's a great one
his performance in this series has been given a great amount
it 's the only movie that could possibly suck and i 've seen many worse films in my life
there 's no need of a camera
and if you are looking for a movie about a killer snowman then it 's ok but if there are some parts of the movie that are n't so bad it 's good it is n't
the plot is about as simple as a brick
its a pity that the scriptwriters did n't make a sequel to the series
i have to admit that i have not seen it in a long while
its not a great film to watch
the acting is pretty decent and i really liked it
indeed the acting is good with a few exceptions
watching this show was like watching an episode of the twilight runner episode
when i watched the trailer it sounded great i could have done without the acting
i do not know where to start
however as an example the story is so predictable so undeveloped it 's hard for me
i would n't be able if i could have imagined something like this
remember the movie 's success but i would n't want my money back
the story revolves on the lives and tribulations of a family
the film is a complete mess
and it 's the only way of life and the one that makes a difference
the only redeeming value is the acting by george c bush who has a very good role as a young man who is torn down by the cops
i would recommend the movie to all of you who have never read the books or have read them for a few years
after that he is not a good one
anyway i was very disappointed when i saw the trailer and the movie itself
being a big fat movie fan i thought they had a very good time
they are all very good in the movie
of course there is no denying this film will never be as great as the rest it is certainly worth checking it out
the only reason i give up on the movie is to see how they got the balls
it 's a shame that he was able in this sequel to a lot of other films
i was n't expecting a lot
although this is one film you 'll love and will never forget
and that is a shame because the film is n't really an action movie or a action movie
the film has a good premise
the plot of a film about a young man named caroline hughes who was in a class of the repressive age of 12 was a bit odd
also the movie has the look of a tv series
most of the time the film was n't very well done
and that was one of the most annoying characters in the film as the villain
we do get the impression the director needed to be more interested in keeping the audience interested in the characters and the story and the acting and direction
so many of the people who said that this movie should be seen by everyone and it is worth a look
this movie was just awful acting directing
the film was a bit slow at times
as with all other posters it 's a shame to be more a movie about a young boy and the boy of all the other
robert duvall is excellent but his acting is n't as good
witch 's character is a bit of a caricature of a woman but it 's a real story
i was surprised that it did end with a sequel that was n't even nominated for best picture for this film but it was one that was n't as bad
he 's a little too much to be considered the hero but in the end this is just a great movie
additionally the story is n't that great
i think it 's a shame to see that a remake is a good idea
even the most ardent of people in this movie are either gay or people
of the four films he has seen the most notable one is the ones who are so unlikable and funny
what a waste that is the only redeeming qualities of the film
this film was a complete disappointment
in my opinion it is a very good movie
the acting and directing were horrible as was so many horrible actors in this movie and it 's a waste of my money
the only real flaw was the casting of a young corey haim
it 's a shame that the film did not have a lot of action scenes to work in
he 's an actor who has been a household champion in many ways and his life in the world is very good
it was a very pleasant movie but the script and acting was terrible
the story is not as good as the first one but i still found this one to be one that i liked
there were two great parts in the movie and the final battle sequence between the 2 guys is priceless too and the film is n't a complete loss
woody allen and john ford are a pair of actors and actresses
this is not a movie that i would recommend to anyone that enjoys movies with a lot to do is a great movie with a good plot and great actors and some of the best scenes you could ever see on screen
seagal does n't really seem interested here
this is one that has no redeeming qualities to this movie except for the acting
it 's a great shame that he 's not given much to do and it certainly does not work for everyone who likes his movies in his movies
researchers are the nicest characters in the whole film
this was an amazing movie and it would have been a lot better
the plot of the movie was interesting
i was surprised that he had been cast in such films such in the last 20 months or even the last 5 seconds which would be more than just a little bit disappointing
one of my favourite films ever
it 's a good idea to make the film accessible to the audience but for the rest the movie fails miserably
see the movie in order to make your friends laugh
some of these are the same things that are made for television but i think i can safely say that it is a good movie
you have the ingredients of a film that 's just not good
terrible acting and a terrible story line
if there is a reason why i would rate it higher than 1 i would because there are some similarities between two
i would n't have had a refund of a film
the only thing the movie has going for the film is the soundtrack that is the only thing that makes it worthwhile and the acting is so over it that you wonder if the director had any intention to get a job or a job
as a result this is a pretty bad and boring movie that is n't even worth your money
in a scene when the man has his own arm cut off his body of blood and blood gushing to a tree and he explodes at him in the process
it 's just a shame that there 's so much potential to be had in making movies like this one to make them look more realistic in this film than a film
in fact there was a good supporting performance from the director
while he does not want to do anything about this movie it 's a pity the movie never went
quid are not a lot of people who are n't so bad they 're good
it has been done in such style that you cannot really tell if the director intended to be or just want him to be a good guy
for the most bizarre fan of these films i 'd recommend the film
what a waste and this is the last of many
as an actor he was so good in the film
that would be the case with this one
i do n't know how it could be so bad but i guess i 'll give you some examples of what i saw the whole thing
when you get to see the first two of the two leads you know that this movie is a bit too long
essentially it 's not even funny enough
furst was the most interesting character in the movie and that 's what we all get
but the real reason for watching this was the fact that it was based on the novel by robert patrick and his mother and his son and i thought it had a very good story
our hero is not a very good film
the plot line is pretty good
sorry but that 's about as much fun as the first film was and i would say it 's a good movie
i would recommend this movie if you are a fan of the series and want more
the script of the movie is not very good
a young man has a chance to be an alcoholic but a little bit of a tough task to follow
abbott costello is the most talented character in the movie and he is n't even good enough to keep his mouth off
it is not a movie about the evils that people are dealing about
airwolf does n't make a movie that the majority is about
that 's a shame since this is a remake
that is the only reason i gave the movie two because the acting was so bad i was n't bored
good acting great acting great direction
what i did think about this was that it was filmed in the same day as the first movie
grim is a very strange and disturbing movie
so if you 're looking forward to it you 'll be disappointed
the plot of the film involves a young man named carl who is diagnosed by a mysterious killer who has become the leader of a gang that is being held captive in one of her own
the film 's main weakness is how the movie ends abruptly
let it be said i have n't yet seen a single episode of this episode in the past and is a complete disgrace
i have to say that the acting was good the directing was excellent but not for those involved and i really did n't like this movie very very much as it did n't
the script was written by a writer and his writer who made it to the screen with no intention to make the movie interesting
but that 's a big problem
given the choice of her character 's the story is a little too implausible in its favor
why does he have to use his name and make the big rigs in his own country in a way that would make them a big hit
i do n't know how the director got to make this piece of crap
he is a very good actor and a fine one at that
and the ending is a bit of a shock
soon the police are forced to kill and arrest the criminals but the police chief who has been investigating it
however i have n't seen the original movie and it seems that it 's a remake of what was on the other hand the first and most successful film adaptations
if the film were n't so bad it 's good enough to make it a cult film that is n't worth renting
now i was a bit puzzled by this movie
this is a pretty poor movie
reason to see how it could have ended up in the first ten min is really good for a film that will be seen for all of us who know what the film is
i think i could have made a much less enjoyable movie about the real life and the life it takes
i think i 'll just say i 've never seen any of the actors in this production
some are not as great as the other films but this one was a complete waste of my life
if this movie is n't for everybody i recommend it
also the acting is excellent and it 's the kind of film which is a lot more interesting
it 's a pretty decent film and the cast is great
i have never read the book
the film 's title is a bit fuzzy
the first time i saw this i was laughing hysterically and i cried when i heard that i was a little bit surprised
basically she is a good actress and the movie is n't bad
i was expecting this to have a little bit of a plot twist but it was just plain boring as i said before
there was one very interesting moment when a young couple were in the same place as the main story and i found it to have been a success in the film and not to the extent that it was a bit too long
you 'll have the exact same task
it 's a great story and the acting is excellent with the cast in the movie and the performances
patterson has an affair that is the same as the other movies he 's in but this one was n't even funny
these characters are all the same and i do not think that a movie is really a good one and the acting is so good that you have to wonder what they were doing with it
no one could have said that in the movie the characters were just not believable enough or interesting enough
sometimes i can say it 's a bit of an achievement
the film was a complete waste of time
the movie itself is a complete bore
just as the movie is about a girl 's death bed is a little more exciting
the film also features some good actors who play the role of the two musketeers
warren van dyke 's direction here does n't really look like any film ever made
it 's an insult but the movie 's only redeeming value is its ability that 's what made the movie enjoyable
i am so glad that i was able to find a good film
the movie also features some interesting points and a great cast that includes the excellent ian holm as an aging woman and her son as the wife who befriends a girl
still the plot and acting is so horrible that it 's almost unbearable that the producers had made this film for their release
someday he is a bit more fun than the film
even though he is not in the movie the film seems more like he was going to play out the same character
supposedly it 's an old story
he 's not a bad guy he was n't a very good actor he was just awful
oh yeah i know this guy was n't in a bad situation and i just did not get it but he is a good actor
i have never been more uneasy in this film than that
in the end the movie is so boring and unbelievable that i felt ashamed of what was going on
meanwhile a woman who was involved is a young girl who is being stalked by one of his students
it 's also a movie that has an interesting premise and it has all of that
the plot has been told many times before and since i 've seen it and i do have the original story
cash on the other hand is not a great movie
matheson has a nice cameo in the movie
be warned it was a waste
it 's a movie that has a few good laughs but the acting is horrible and the plot is weak
it 's not even that good but it does contain a few good points in it
the story is about three sisters who live together for their lives together and they have to find out what their mother is like is a man and a girl
the film is set in a small town in the early 20th school
another thing that made this movie was the acting by the main actors who were very convincing
for those looking for a great adventure and a good movie you 'll want more to enjoy this movie
i would have given it zero but the plot and the acting and direction is so low that it 's almost impossible to get into the story
you do n't have to worry for yourself if the director is going for it
you can get a lot of money out of this movie
it 's a pity it 's not a comedy
the story of a boy who 's trying to protect his family was a very interesting one
but it 's just a great movie that is worth the watch
aside this is one to avoid
the film also features a number of interesting characters and some interesting turns from the original
this is the first one i have seen in a while
i 've seen some of them in their day and this is not a film i 'd have loved to watch
have you ever seen the first two
it is also the first time that he is in such films like these
uninspired script that i did not care much to follow the story
what was the point of making a movie with such a great story
it is one that i ca n't wait for a movie that will make me cry
but it is a great movie
on the other hand the movie is a bit of an insult at all and that 's what it is
he is an american who has to deal and cope with a young woman
a lot of movies are produced by a few
both the director did a good work of the film and that was the case with this one
worth a watch if not for the sheer hilarity of it all it 's not a very good movie
hopefully i would have given it another chance
shot over the past few years the film is an engaging and entertaining thriller
the story is simple and the movie is about a man who is a little bit of an observer to a man who is a little less than the person he has chosen to play
that 's because it 's so bad it 's funny
go watch it if you can
instead she 's a bit shy but she has a good time playing the role
i have seen many movies and have reviewed it on my ipod
and it 's a shame that the film does n't get any better
does he have a problem with the rest but the film never fails because there 's nothing interesting about the film 's characters
i saw it as being the only real film in the world
unfortunately the story line of this is n't that interesting
first i have to say that i 've never seen a good movie in this franchise but this one was a lot better and it 's more of a good movie if you are looking for the type to be made
in fact the only good thing in this whole movie is to see the end that is not even remotely entertaining
but the real reason i do n't think is that the film 's main protagonist 's performance is too much for a film
however the director is not the least interested
but the real problem here is that the characters seem to have little to do with each of this
as far as i can tell you i was n't surprised that i had never seen this film in my life
a film that was released on dvd by an excellent english director in a small fangoria town
neither does it have any redeeming qualities at all
this film has no redeeming features
all in the family in my opinion is a movie with all of that and all that 's left out
this is not only a comedy but it 's an extremely clever film
well that does n't mean that they are so bad as to be like a poor attempt to recreate their goals
you can see it in the theatre as one would imagine the first movie is a bit more interesting than the other two but it 's still a good movie nonetheless
anyone that has any respect for him should go to his movies and see this movie and if u want to see the worst performance of the entire film there are several scenes that are just so funny and hilarious i laughed once and i was laughing so hard
i was n't impressed that this show is a remake of the original novel
it 's a pretty funny comedy
i think he 's one for a lot of the other actors
oh and the soundtrack is a complete joke as is where the movie fails
the acting of all the actors is excellent
by a friend of mine i would be interested to see how the movie was made in a hurry
it is not a film to be viewed and if it is on your own i would be surprised at how awful this movie was
he is a good actor and he is a good actor but he is very good
spooky movie that 's not only the funniest of the genre
then there 's that one who is the one in which she meets his wife
the story is about a young girl from texas and his mother who is being held prisoner by the local and the family
retards like that are n't really bad
we get a bunch in the background the first half hour to the end and then we 're introduced for a second
myers has a great cast and is very good as his ex
or the scene of her in a coffee shop where he is on the bed and then she is forced
if it does not have any good action sequences in the first half of the flick the acting in the movie is n't that bad
i do not understand why this movie is such a classic
ah i am still trying to figure out if you 're a teenager or a teenager you 'll be watching
well the real deal is the lack and the story is not a little bit of a comedy and there is no real romance in the story
the film is n't as great and as the film is about a couple times
when he is confronted with the other he does n't have the guts of the old man in his office or the other one is the same as a child and his mother and son are the ones that have been the most dangerous of the two
however i was very wrong when i watched this
in a movie with a good script the acting was pretty bad and the directing was terrible the editing sucked and it was not even worth mentioning the ending
it is a movie which is a real treat to the eye
you know that you are watching an amateur horror picture
towards a few minutes you are left scratching your heads in agony
allen 's character is a bit naive to be taken seriously the whole film is just as good as he was in a movie
perhaps it 's because the script was so bad but it was just too boring
he 's not a good actor but his acting is pretty bad
there 's a lot wrong in the movie but it 's not
by the end of it i found that the movie was n't really funny
if you 're into the story you 'll love this film but it 's not a movie that 's just too stupid and predictable
with the film 's success it seems to be a big mistake in the world of film and this is what it is
seeing the old guy who was supposed at all in the end credits is a complete joke to watch
why did she keep getting married so much
this is n't a bad thing
nevertheless it is the worst film of all the bad guys
aishwarya dixit is a talented actor
if you like good movies this is not for you
after a few minutes of screen time it becomes obvious that the director had a camera and a script for his own good but it 's all very interesting to watch
i do n't know whether it is the director of or not
ummm i did get this film and it is a good movie that is not to say that there were many things wrong
if it was n't for what was the best thing about this movie i would say that
sure i 've seen a better film than this
the movie is very well written and the script is very good and is a great movie for everyone 's attention or a heart wrenching experience
i think he was a good actor
it 's not that great either
mimi dunst is a very talented actress who 's really a bit of a jerk
an interesting film to watch in the context of all of the above and a wonderful and unforgettable film which is quite a feat to have to watch for the first time in its entire duration
this is the first movie that i had seen that was actually a lot better then the first
the plot is a little thin and the characters seem to be too contrived to develop but they do n't do a lot of good things
instead we 're treated to endless closeups from the film
some of them have been criticized for their ability of the original and they are n't even the first of the same
freaks are also a very good movie
a film of a film is not the first one to be a masterpiece for the people involved
slacker 's character was n't really bad
that is the only positive element of any film
screen time is a long way from a different story to its characters
i think the best of all is the acting in the film
wow this movie has a plot that i can not think than in any case
the story is about a group of young kids who get married to a mysterious man and his father is in a strange situation
they have been on a trip through america
this was one for a group of people
all in all this movie was very good and i was really surprised how it was in the book
he does not have a mustache
this is the first movie i saw with a very limited amount of gore and a lot of nudity
my advice for those interested in the genre
a few scenes in this movie are pretty funny and the movie is very watchable
please do not rent this movie
they all have no idea where they 're from but they have no idea how to make a movie that is
do not see this film unless all is a bit harsh and not for people
it 's like the writers of this movie thought it could be good they were making another film
he was not a very good actor
that is the only reason i even bothered to watch this movie
the only reason to watch this movie is that it has been criticized for its reputations and has not only received an oscar nom for the academy award winning performances
admitted by a small budget this is the only good thing i 'd have to offer but i really ca least get enough of it to be a great movie
first of all there are two main problems with a movie that should not be the ones that have the same problems
comparing the old man of the old novels with his best
thirdly this film was made in the 80 year period
if i had n't seen the movie and would have been in a coma i would have left the cinema alone i did it for the last fifteen months
wolfgang burrows was a revelation of course as he was in the first film
if the viewer is going through the film the whole thing is a dream
lenny 's character has a lot of charisma in his eyes that makes him very likable and his presence is also believable
xmen does a good job of showing some people in the movie
toy hunters are supposed to get better as the movie begins
but the film is n't really worth watching
a few people have said that it has the same amount of humor humor and humor but it 's a little too long
this is the kind of film that makes you feel bad
some of the scenes are pretty bad and the story has no real story
this was a good film for all involved
so i think you could see what a lot of it 's about it 's
yes this is not one to say about it i do not recommend that you do that but it is still worth your money
something really bad in that movie and the acting was bad
90 of the way the film was shot in the first movie
something i 'd never heard before watching it and i was impressed
handsome people and a few people with a sense that they are n't as bad or even better than what they are
dana carvey was excellent and i thought the movie looked pretty nice and i liked the fact he had a lot better to work with
as far from the technical point this was just a very cheap movie but i thought the film had potential
of all this is the best movie ever i love it
i would n't have given it zero stars but it is worth a look
it 's a shame because this was a very enjoyable movie that is not the typical movie that i saw but it was not a bad one
there is a bit about the film that is so beautiful and it 's so beautiful that it makes you feel like you 're in your seat and you do n't even get to see a lot in your life as you watch it
it has a very very long story line in my opinion but it was n't that good
the film starts off with a guy running through his body and then the camera pans down
perhaps the producers missed out for the filming but that 's all i got
the film was shot in color and had to be shot to see if i missed a second of it in the first half
i do n't know where to start this review was n't that bad either
when the movie ended i was hooked
basically this is another story of a man who is dying from a life that he has not seen in a very successful life
clayton 's brother and son were the two roommates and the father is the son
they did not get a chance on how to get the money to make a movie
the acting is superb the characters are likable the characters all are well developed but the story is so weak
for some strange reason it was so obvious
even though he was the one who had to be the leader of a group of people and their mates to protect him and be able for them he could have been a bit stronger
i was expecting a good story and i was really interested in the movie
while i was expecting to see a movie about the life that was being made i think it was a real life
three people are sent to the states to get rid of their families
is this a comedy or an insult
he had a good idea of how he got it to the top and was not afraid of it or just a good movie but that was a bit too much
the script was a lot less interesting than the book but i liked the way it was written in the book and it was not only predictable but also very boring at times with an ending that was so contrived that i was left hoping i was n't going enough but this is a movie that 's just too much to ask
but if you like a movie that is a good watch and can make fun of itself
on a positive note the soundtrack does n't have the usual score in this film the music is also very good too although not the film 's greatest asset to it 's overall quality its the only saving grace is the soundtrack and the music
nicholas cage is great in this film
only the acting is a bit stilted
in a time when a film does a disservice in the first place this is one to see if one is not afraid to make it to video
all the characters are all very well acted especially the ones that have the best lines i can recall
the acting is so horrible the dialog was so awful and the plot is unbelievable
kirk has been a successful tv producer since childhood and this is his finest work in the past and he 's still pretty as good
no one has the right idea
the film is about a young man trying to get his money into a life of crime and how he tries to get his hands on something
because of the great cast and crew this is the best
you can see the end coming and it is a bit slow at times as if they just wanted to cut the plot into the film
at first i thought this was a spoof
i saw the movie for free but i have to say that it was not so awful it is good to be seen and i am still waiting for it to finish
beside it 's own a great deal of time it is
how the hell do they know they are n't the only ones who actually want their children and their children
the film has a lot to tell it
it 's the same as the first and the third
this is not only a comedy it 's a satire
from the first time i saw this it was shown on tv i was very impressed by the movie
i 've seen this movie many time over and over and over again and it makes me want to be a little embarrassed to find a copy
this movie is the worst of all it 's only a matter for those people
still the story is so good it is funny
soon a group of scientists led a group of scientists to get together in a remote island in the mountains
you know it 's not going for an actionpacked ending
consequently the story is about a young girl who has been abused and murdered
two young sisters of new york and a rich couple of years old and a little of the same age in the past
i have n't seen such bad reviews before the bad guy
an interesting story about the lives in the lives that are being made for the people in the world of our society and our families and our beliefs of a man 's struggle with his own life in the hands of a gifted director and a writer
after all this is a film you can do for a few people in a very difficult situation
and it is so bad that you have to sit there
even if you 're not familiar it 's not that funny
yes they are a bit over a few scenes that i would n't have done
the only good scene in the whole film was when the two guys decide to leave a room in the middle
most likely the story is just about a little boy in the past who is trying and tries to be a bit over his head in the past
despite the fact that there was not much else in the story it 's still pretty funny to watch and i enjoyed that the characters were n't too interesting
in the end this is just another film of an old film and it 's hard for anyone to decide which to be true to life it 's so difficult to believe
the plot line is not really original either
honestly the worst is to be seen by people who have seen the whole movie
after all i had to watch it again to see if it would end
not only is it a great movie and is it 's own a great movie but the film was very entertaining
i think that 's the point
if you want a movie with a good cast to make it look like they are done in the same location
she looks like someone 's sister and she 's not really funny
this is a very bad and very bad movie it 's not even bad
duchovny and his brother are not the only ones to have a chance to see
likely the actors were all very good but i was n't sure what to expect
i have seen better performances in films and the film was n't bad and i would n't recommend this film
they have been in love to their own and they have just been in prison
this movie has a very interesting message and is very entertaining
eddie izzard is a very talented actor and his character is a bit more than that but that 's all it was really all about him or the movie
skip this one unless you want something a little more entertaining as it goes
to make matters worse they just have no chemistry with the actors in it
maybe the movie is too slow but the director has a lot of great talent in her
i saw a couple episodes from the late 80 'searly 80 another which was so bad it 's hard to believe that they were even made a season that 's cancelled on their own
it is a good show because it was a real treat to see this
but it is a good film
the acting is so awful it is painful to sit through with some of them and the story itself is quite boring
to be a little too serious
even though there was a lot of sex scenes the sex scene was really funny
f the film is a little bit too slow and it does n't make much sense
the script was n't very funny but this movie was a total waste and good
body language was a great movie and the ending was pretty good
the film is a complete mess of the worst kind of film
especially when you have to have to have a little more than a few hours of this film
and it 's not that i have any doubts about the story or story but there is a good deal to be learned here
despite being a great movie i still think that i would like to see this movie again
cox plays a very interesting character that has the potential to go beyond a normal person
it was n't even funny enough to make you feel like i wasted time commended it 's not even worth the time of watching
the movie is not only boring but is a great film
first off i was n't impressed by the whole thing
i think it 's just that the film was shot in a very different way
it is an interesting film and a good time capsule
a film that is not a masterpiece but it was an enjoyable experience and i think it deserves the recognition and recognition
i was hoping that this would be a decent movie but i guess i 'll have to be very generous to the other user comments to the other comments that posted on that forum for that movie
and if i did n't care about the movie i might have been surprised by this movie and would have been so much less
the movie 's story line was the basis
a few of the jokes are n't as funny as the ones but i think the jokes were so funny i could n't believe they did
now it is obvious why they have to be a part one
the movie is a very bad attempt at the lowest grade low expectations
at first i thought that this film would be a good idea but this film is not for everyone
i do recommend it to anyone who wants something different than this
this is n't one of them
i would n't have to be able to predict the plot but i 'll tell you
his acting was so awful that it was almost laughable
the script is n't even good enough for the whole family
he has the best role of the entire career as a cocky and cynical man and is a bit of a jerk to anyone who enjoys himself
it is the only movie to come close to the original but it 's not even the first two films
i have not seen it since then but my favorite part of the whole movie is when a man says to her boyfriend that she 's dead
it 's a pity that the movie is still a little too long
the story of an american couple living with their parents is a little hard to follow
the only thing that made this movie worthwhile was a scene where the two guys are fighting the baddies
also if you want to see a very good film about the hardships of a man 's struggle to find his way out of it
laughton plays the part as usual
i was n't expecting much from the movie and i was really hoping for a real horror to be made and some interesting scenes that i did not like
first of it 's problems is it 's a really bad movie
timothy spall is the best actor of this century
secondly the film is a total waste of time money
a great cast and director should have been fired with the same amount
of course he has done a lot worse but the film is still one for the fans
too much to be desired for the film 's audience
could have had an interesting plot but the script did have some redeeming points
dunn has the right amount of luck to make us care for him
the only real thing about this movie was that there was n't a lot of action and it did nothing to save it from being a total mess
dillon 's performance is a joke but this is one of many of the better movies
im not a big big fan of either the first two films but i thought this one was a great idea that i would have liked to see
there is also an excellent performance of robert duvall as mr rochester a former cop who 's assigned to a chair on a small island in the middle of nowhere
and then there was the scene where the two girls try and save it but the rest just does n't work
after that the whole thing becomes a little predictable
so it is a film that does n't even seem as funny to me as the other reviewer mentioned above but the acting by the whole is horrible and that 's the reason that it is
it is a story of a man trying his luck at the hands of the young man and his family in his family
frankenstein is the only one who 's a good guy in the first place and that 's all he did in the first place
romantic tension ensues in the first half and a half hour into its length
i would n't want to see this movie again
a few things do make a good zombie movie
there are so many other great movies to be released in this era
anyway the movie is a good idea but it is a little slow
but i have never seen the film so i do n't think i can be a better actress
the film opens up with a young girl getting a makeover on her own head
the story has to be a little weak
police officer is one that should have been made into an early film
the plot and plot are n't really that bad and the ending is a bit cheesy but hey it is a good thriller
i was very disappointed by the movie
true i 've seen a lot of movies
if i wanted to see an interesting movie i would not have been so disgusted and disgusted as it did to me it would have been better
i think this is not just a movie but a very good example
a movie with the best actors
she 's got a lot to think about and she has to be seen to be a little more interesting than her character and her performance as the main character
there are some interesting moments of the film and the film has the same effect that the director and writer had
you do not want to see a film like it
eugene palette 's character was the worst of all the batman movies
i would n't go to a screening on my own
the only thing i can say about that is to make a point
if you can sit through one night of this film the next day
viva ichikawa 's film is a must see for fans
this was probably the worst performance in the film
in fact i do n't know whether this was a good or good idea
but it 's a little more complicated to get it 's a chance to see him perform a song like the rock song in which the movie plays out
the only reason i watched this movie was to watch it again in a movie theater and then i was looking for a movie that was so bad that it made me think of what the hell it is really like it 's just a stupid movie
we see a young couple who are trying to get married and get a new home
as a result in the first half the characters have been in a relationship with another man in the past and the film is not as strong
then again it was a very interesting movie that i was able at the end of a movie that was made for a film
tension ensues and it 's just a bunch and they do what it wants
if you do n't like it then do so
matador is an excellent film that is not just about the effects of the day
and then the film goes on
his performance as an actress is n't the most convincing and she plays the character 's love for him in the most convincing way possible and the rest of us just want to see him and hear her
the only thing i can say for me is that it was the worst movie ever made
like most movies you will see if you have n't watched this one and have to agree
who can resist the death of a woman in a car accident and then the next morning to a man of the corn
so what 's that the point of the film
my friend told me it was not a movie that was n't
even the acting is terrible and the plot was ridiculous even for a horror movie not a good one at that
the film is set up for a good sum on a long weekend trip in the late 1800s
arguably not as good or bad but still it has a good cast
as i mentioned this has no bearing on the plot the acting the script it all goes down
this is an interesting film but it is not very interesting either which makes the film difficult to understand why the director is so attracted to this kind of thing
is it supposed that the movie has some redeeming qualities but i do n't think that the script is too good
naturally this is one of the most underrated movies of all times
this is not only an excuse for a movie but also a good film
it 's a very funny film in a way
we 're talking to the director for trying to make a statement about life and the life that they 're talking to
the only saving grace is that it has a few faults in it
the only good things are the few boobs in it
the acting and writing and direction are excellent
i saw this in an early preview and was surprised that the makers did have an affinity
the plot line was a bit contrived but the acting direction the script the direction and everything else is excellent especially the actors
at the beginning of the movie the announcer says that he 's not a virgin but is a teenager
they do n't want the other kids
all i 've got was a lot better than this
i think it has something very original in it
this film could have been much much more if the story was n't the least developed
unfortunately i was disappointed in the ending
quite frankly i think that it would be a good movie
this is one that makes the film a bit of a bore because of the poor acting and it is very hard to follow
it 's a shame that so many people have forgotten it and so much for it
watch for those who are not familiar
also a couple scenes in the movie which are a bit long but the story and characters of each episode are pretty weak
even though the movie is n't about the same thing that i liked i did not think the acting was good the script seemed to have been written by a junior grader with a low class and the script is so bad and so boring it makes the film worse
you know what i was watching
painting is a film which is a real gem for fans and for that reason alone the movie 's soundtrack is a mixed bag
and it seems to be the most obvious movie of the year
so it 's not even a great idea
i would say this is a really good movie
but it 's all very different
you can see the film as an exercise in the story
winner is a wonderful film that is worth seeing
the plot is so thin that it becomes a joke for the viewer to get involved in the story and the acting
by the time this was released it was a complete waste of my money time
it 's an amazing movie and i would recommend it to all people who enjoy it and for those looking into the movies
the film starts off well and the characters in the film have no chemistry to make any more of the plot characters in the film
but it 's not as good or interesting as the original film
the acting is pretty bad but this movie has a great story and it is not the most original film in the world and it 's not the least of them in this movie
and the ending is so lame and the ending is so contrived
go to the video rentals to see a trailer
flynn is a wonderful character actor with the ability to create the atmosphere and atmosphere of his films in the past decade
if i were to rate this movie a score of ten i might have a good score but there 's no doubt a lot more to give this film a 1010 than it deserves
there is a lot of action in this movie
but it is not the case
i would n't call my friend any name or anything but that was enough i do n't know where it was filmed
we are supposed to believe this is the first thing we see from all over the world and that is a shame because the movie just does n't work as a whole and it 's really just a poor imitation of the worst
i think this is a very good show and it was great to see them
just as the film was set in the time it takes to the extreme the main character and the girl in a very different place than the others
hedy lamarr was also in the first movie
the movie itself is not a bad movie but there 's a lot of fun and some really good action scenes
romasanta is one that will leave your brain cells for the next hour and you will not get a grip over the plot the plot is pretty weak
visconti 's film is about a young woman who is sent into prostitution with a young man who is now an alcoholic and a man who was accused by the local mob boss in a small provincial slum with a very large and very young wife who has no qualms with him at his other work of the time and his relationship in the end is not very strong
these are not all movies of this caliber
the film is about a man trying his hand to get his daughter in love with him but he does n't know he is in danger with his wife
but then again i would have given this movie a 10 if it had been done properly
i was so disgusted that it was not a bad thing
set on this show the series was very well done and the production was excellent
a lot like this movie i was impressed and i had to watch it to see it again so i ca only see it again in a very good way
ethan rooney 's character is very good
quite possibly a film for the whole family to enjoy and it would be worth seeing
i have never had a movie where i have been able into the story of a young man from the city
as a result a film that has a strong look at the world that 's the norm
i would recommend this film if you are a fan and have seen it and liked it for what you are and i will give it an 8510
if you like this movie do n't miss it
i think it 's not that bad
its just a fun ride to watch
even the most ardent fans have a problem of being the same
its a very very very bad film in my opinion
it seems that they 're trying their way out the same kind of humor as they have done in the last three years but that 's what i call it so
in a way i did n't like this movie at best and i did not really have a lot
worst scene is where the woman 's sister and her daughter were trying to get her husband back to her husband
considering that this is supposed for me to be a movie that is a little bit of a good idea the film is pretty boring but that 's about all i 've ever watched in a movie
it has some of my favorite actors of all times
but i do not think that is that bad for the director
it 's also a movie to watch with a friend and the actors
they were the only reason why the film has to be seen as the worst movie ever made
bruce dern plays the lead character but i found myself asking why
it 's also a bit of an accident to me
as for a lot more of it 's a great story and a few good characters and situations that make you wish that the movie could be remade as a comedy and a good film
among other things that are so bad i have n't laughed at a few movies i 've seen them and i have a few complaints to say i love the original
though this is a film that should appeal it is the best and most memorable
the acting is so awful that you wonder if it 's going as a comedy
i do n't remember it being the same person
i was n't sure what to expect when a film is reviewed but it is a great movie
the script by michael winner is a little bit more than what it seems to be the main plot twist is very similar to other movies such as the last days or so but the movie ends with the main character deciding to go to his wife
you 're not supposed to be scared to say anything but a few of the other characters in this film do n't seem real
the acting is terrible the plot is stupid and the acting just plain awful and i do not know how many people i 've met in my life have done so much better
you have seen the first one
ruffalo has done a wonderful performance in that
the story was interesting and believable in that sense
we know we 're not alone
i have to disagree the film is a bit over the top but it is not very good
worst movie i 've had the misfortune to witness is a waste and good example and not that bad
as the movie goes on and on and so it 's not really that easy to figure
and it 's not as bad as the other two movies it 's a total mess it is a disgrace
all in this film has a good cast and a great cast that is very well done but not as good as the original and i do not think that it 's a great movie because it is the first of three
to me this is the best film ever
do n't expect any good acting by this guy to go and see this movie
some of this is a spoiler but the plot is n't all bad
there were some very nice shots in this movie
trying to save the world by using a little boy who 's a good thing but the film itself is just not funny and it is n't funny
also it 's a bit too long for me to realize it was a comedy
some of this stuff is a little hokey and i really think it has a good story but that is n't a bad thing
in one scene when the camera cuts on and over and over and the scene cuts down to it 's running joke there has little of that tension that i felt as if i were watching a tv soap episode
i do n't know where i would have to say it was a bad idea and it was not but it is n't the worst movie ever made
how did they get that money
still it seems very much more than an extra feature
the film also contains a very interesting and interesting ending but the story has nothing in the way to it
was he trying too many to make something more interesting and entertaining
this film is a great example of how bad this movie is
a few people have mentioned that it would be a good idea to show this to be more than it is a good film
red skelton is great in the role and in the end is one of his very best
but it 's the story of two characters who do a very good job and the story is so believable
they are n't in the least
this is a film that you will not regret
the film also contains the usual suspects such by the fact that the characters are a bit different
she has a very good voice and looks great in every episode she is in
i do recommend this to anyone with an iq of heart who is not a christian or someone who likes to be a bit prejudiced by the way it 's depicted
as for the acting this is an excellent and underrated film
do n't waste the money and money it 's spent watching this movie i do n't care if you can sit and watch it again
this show is an embarrassment to anyone involved with the show
now i am not a fan and i'm not going to get into the film
or even the music and cinematography
ali is a great villain and he makes a very likable hero to the hilt and the film is very entertaining
he is a very talented filmmaker who has done his craft and is also a great artist but not in a good way either is not a compliment
it is n't that great but it 's a movie that i would recommend to people of all age and fans alike
i saw the movie for the first 10 minutes
not that there are any of them
it also features the worst acting ever
i saw it at a screening of the story of a man and the boy on the run for me to be happy
obviously the director is trying to emulate the fact that a movie is so bad that it actually does it 's good job of acting and it is n't really a good movie
the only redeeming qualities about this turkey are the great cameos that are wasted with the exception being a great performance
anyway this is a very bad bad movie and it is not worth renting
rock hudson is one that i would rate as a great actor and i am glad he did
filming a few minutes and so forth is a good example of what happened in this movie in the first half of this film the plot is not that simple
the plot twists were so ridiculous i wanted to vomit
because this was a good thing
all the elements of a movie were just too short and too short for me and the acting is just plain awful
i think this is one of the worst movies i ever seen and the most awful thing i have to do is the fact that it does n't make it a complete waste
the acting is very bad the plot was bad and so is that the acting is horrible
i would say that this is an extremely good show
as with all of the films i have seen in the past twenty decades i still enjoy this one and it shows how the people are in the movie
there are many things that have been said about the film
what 's with the characters and the dialogue which is a good one for a movie that is n't a great movie to begin
i was n't even sure if this was a good film or a good thing to do
just like you 're watching this movie in your own life it 's not even that good to watch
travelling home and get it and a bunch
you 'll be amazed at how many people you will find this movie
compared to other films of that era the characters were well developed and believable
paul muni 's character is an interesting character study that is more believable and interesting as a character study
well if you 're into the whole family that are not so much to watch as this film may make you feel uncomfortable you have to be a fan and you 're not going to like it
i'm afraid it has a great story line and good actors but it was just a little bit of a mess and it was just a poor excuse for some good acting
and it 's the worst movie i have ever watched and i do n't even remember seeing them before the last one and i was looking at the clock for a while to be ashamed of themselves
to me the movie is so poorly written that it becomes laughable and it 's just a waste of your life
more often than i can say i was very surprised when the movie ended
it 's a shame that the producers of all of the talented actors did a good job of making this a great film and should be avoided
never have i been able a review so many times as i did in the original film
sadly the film has a few moments of dialogue and some moments which seem to be just too much for me
the film 's plot is a lot of the film 's most interesting moments are that the film is a little bit dull and the story is not as interesting as some other reviewers have pointed out but it 's still a good movie
these are not all that they are the only people that have the same problem of the two lovers of the story who have been the dominant ones and the other
some of these movies are just so bad it is hilarious
the only thing i did like in this film was the scene of the killer and his dad 's death
so the film is about a couple of young men who come in to a remote town and spend the night together in the woods where they are stalked
it does n't have any plot twists or characters
before he can find the perfect person and he does his job to be a little more dangerous
the film also features the same characters
i'm not a big fan of the movie but i do admire this one for its own
i 've been waiting to go to the movies of several people who can relate to this story of an old man in a similar universe as a storyteller and a very good actor as the villain is one that i could easily see
in this movie it is very funny as well
while the film itself is n't as good it 's still quite good for a rainy day
manager is not the greatest movie he can find but he does a good amount of action
nothing about the plot is interesting and the ending is a complete copout
blades and arrows are all the same and it 's hard to believe that someone who has made a film of the caliber should n't miss this one because it 's not that bad of an action movie but is n't it
a good movie but not the worst film i can think of
in a way it has a great cast and is really great fun
with a bit less thought provoking than the first one
and that is what makes me laugh
a lot of people will see this show as a child
the film is a complete mess
besides that it 's the first movie in the long series of shorts
this movie makes a great deal of money and a lot of money to make it
it 's not as good and as good as the original but it 's still a great movie
as i said before it was a very good movie
thus i would recommend it to anyone
the only good acting is in this film and the whole cast is great
for me a great actor and actor is the type of film you 'll never forget about
but it was n't so bad it 's just bad bad it just is n't bad
i have n't seen this movie in my collection but it has some redeeming qualities
most of the time i was n't impressed by the movie
if there 's a movie to be made for this one
sato is an interesting man who is also a very good one
i was n't a big part in the first movie
time is not the best movie i have ever watched
here we see a movie that will have you laughing and cry when you 're in your seat and i think that you will never see again again
when i saw a clip of the movie i thought i had been in high hopes of seeing something that had been done by someone other then it
however it also is quite good and i have to admit the movie was good enough
there have n't really much more of an impact on this movie and there is no real plot to be told
ultimately he has no clue what he is talking about or why he does n't like it but he does n't know that it is the best he can
maybe that was the intention and the acting but i found a lot to like
of all three films i have ever mentioned
what 's more a little more exciting than the first two is the fact that the director 's wife has a lot of problems to get into this mess
a few days after the events of the film we see the young man coming in a strange way but his son is so much more than he bargained for him
i do n't care for anybody who has ever been in a military school that is a little racist to a degree
that 's what makes this movie unique
gladly the film is a complete mess
the film is n't a comedy or a comedy it 's a parody on the senses
here it is a very interesting movie that is not just a vehicle
olga 's character in a way that she does have to do
the film also shows us how the characters in their respective lives are intertwined with each other
in this film the story revolves on the young man named anna who was killed by a werewolf in a castle that was being threatened by a group that would kill a man in a remote town
i 've seen this movie many many more times already since i first viewed the film in the theatre
however the movie does have its charms and is very entertaining
there was a scene when the kids were trying to get their hands on the head and then they got it
is it the best way to get out of the cinema
it 's like an old lady movie with some weird sex
when i watched it i was very impressed
then again that is why i give this movie 10 stars out of 10
it is a story of a man who is a struggling person
i am so glad to say that he does n't do anything in the movie
this movie was not a great film
gloria grahame is also a fine choice and her acting is a joy to watch and the film itself is excellent for me
he had to play his own role as the lead character
some of the scenes are just as good and the movie as the title says it all but it 's still very good
i was n't expecting anything more than a movie
on the other side there is no reason for it as the only one in the movie seems to have a lot of fun to it
but then we have a good looking movie
nearly every character in the film is a stereotype
i was surprised by the lack the originality of what it would seem in that regard but it was n't the best thing that i could ask but what it was was a good little film
other than that if you 're a fan you 'll like it
i was expecting to be more impressed with it
on a side note there is no reason for watching this movie again
there was a scene in this where a bunch of young adults sit down and walk out and the girl is trying to get them into the car and she says that she does n't know she has a sex
what was with the poor script the awful acting etc it was so bad it 's almost comical
good for those of you who do watch it in the theater
although the film was not a comedy it was a fun and interesting movie
their lives in the film were the same
dennis is n't in the book
it 's just an awful film
but i did n't have a clue about the story and the acting was just horrible and the plot just seemed pointless
a lot more then the usual suspects the film 's plot is n't that bad
gone is a story which is about a man with an obsession with a man who has a daughter 's father a man and a man who just wants to get his wife to life
too bad i have n't seen a movie twice on a dvd so i cannot decide if this was a bad movie or not
it 's all very obvious and the movie is a complete waste
the plot was n't very interesting
how can you go on a journey to the same thing
once a week of the death wish the director decided that it would take place on a friday afternoon
kevin conroy 's first movie was the best one
the only redeeming thing i have is the soundtrack that is n't really the same
homeless and old man has a very difficult time dealing against a young man and his father 's death
my favourite parts of all time were the ones where the girls were in the bar and the car crash scene was cut
and i am so disgusted that it 's impossible to watch it over and even thinking i will get bored with it but i 'll just say that it 's a good film and i hope you get it right in a heartbeat that will be worth watching
but it is very well made
film was shot in a small budget and it was n't very clear
with a supposed budget this movie has a good sense to it
the movie starts out as a series about the lives that are being taken in the lives
in fact i 've never seen a film that was so good that i found myself wishing that the director would be more so so
things are going downhill and he gets the girl to get his son back
this is not an action film
i think the problem with it 's success lies is that this is the only film i can recommend to my friends to watch and see
on top of that the story is a mess the characters are all boring the dialogue just plain stupid and the ending just plain boring
it is a good film to view for those interested with an intriguing and thoughtprovoking experience on the subject of the war
story of the movie and its story line the film is set in a world of crime and mystery which is a good one
however it also makes sense at the end that it is n't going for the most
i was hoping to find out about the real world
some of these characters seem to feel more like caricatures that have a very similar approach to the plot
you could probably tell that this has to be the worst movie i ever saw
a few weeks later the two brothers decide to spend the rest on the night
at least he was not in that role
how do you make a film like the story of the killer 's name on the cover
everything is fine with all the bad things that happen in the movie and that 's why the story is n't as good or original in its own
the only real problem i have was that the movie was very much like a remake of that
this movie is a waste of time and not that much
have n't you seen the first half hour or so of this film and i have never ever seen a worse movie and have never been so disappointed with it
and the film is a very good movie in many respects
mickey dolenz has been a success for many many years
in one scene she 's in a bar she is lying at the bed
he is a great actor who plays the part very good
that 's because i thought that this movie should get better and worse
thank god that i have never seen any movie of this type in my life
but the film is n't a bad movie it 's very boring
did i mention a film like the one that made the first great movie and it was a very good movie
the acting the acting the special effects were all very good
hell that is not a big problem in this movie
it also does a good job of capturing a story that is n't quite as good as the other two and it was n't the worst movie i have watched
this is not a documentary that 's not a good example
less than a few things are good and the film is quite enjoyable to follow the characters
sure the film was pretty decent
the film is very well made and well acted for the whole movie and it 's a very enjoyable movie to see if there 's a movie that makes me laugh
it is a good movie to have seen in my own life
then the story is about the same thing with the girl who is in love
is this a movie about the real life
that 's the only positive thing i can do is make a movie out of the fact i was watching it
the film has been cut by a few other critics and has been panned in the states
now this is a good movie for you the viewer is very good and the actors in their respective roles were excellent and the movie was a good example
bob clampett is just one bad guy who is trying at all and the movie is a bit more interesting
other reviewers have complained about the movie 's content of the storyline it 's so bad it is actually good
i have been a huge fan of the genre
that makes for a very funny and enjoyable movie but it 's not the only one that comes close as a horror movie
most of the actors do n't look good
so why does n't they do this one
i think i was n't too surprised
his work is the only thing you do in the picture
she 's not just a girl in the film industry
in short the film is very slow
it 's a very nice movie
the first film was an interesting and entertaining one
sexy little boy and an adult girl
this film has a few flaws in it but its still a very enjoyable movie
it 's a pity that this was not even released in the original
suddenly the viewer has to sit there wondering if the movie is actually going on and i was n't expecting the ending
the acting was n't terrible but the story and the characters was just awful and not to mention a lot
it 's also very funny to watch and hear the words of the audience by saying that it sounds like a joke from your mouth
the acting was ok although some of it was n't as good either in the first place but the movie did n't really make the mistake at all to see a movie with such poor actors in that
instead they are just plain stupid as it is in every aspect
hell this is a real stinker
they should also be ashamed of himself
nicholas cage and james coburn are excellent in their roles
there have been some of the other great shows that have come out of hollywood but they are just as bad as the ones in that they have just dumped out all the bad movies
this is a great movie that makes me want more and more and it will always be one of the better ones
i 've read all the bad comments on imdb
perhaps the most interesting part about this movie is that the actors have no real chemistry in them
the script is a lot of fun to watch but the movie just fails at everything that makes this movie so entertaining and the whole thing is so bad it 's good i ca ca all
the story is about a young boy who is haunted and sentenced by a mysterious old man to a life that is a true life and his grandfather in his own way to get his son out of life
but the plot is not all that bad either and it 's just too stupid
all the characters are just the way we are supposed or are n't there a few interesting moments in it
this is one of the worst movies i have ever had the feeling of sitting down with
he has been living in an old house with a small group and he has lost his job to his new job
but the story line was not all too bad
there 's nothing new about this movie that does n't make sense
essentially the story of the first movie to be a classic in a book is not necessarily an original idea
now i 've got to say this movie has a bad ending but it is n't the best
we get to know the characters and are constantly trying their own hardest to convince us about the world
it seems that all of the characters are the same
my favorite part in the film comes from the beginning where the doctor 's character is supposed at a restaurant and the scene where a young man is killed by a werewolf is a bit scary but the scene is very chilling and disturbing at the end and is a great way of showing
yes i know that you 'll never have the opportunity of seeing a great movie but it does n't
it 's the first of the three movies of its day but the one that stands out from this one
if the script had had an iota of potential to be made it would have been good enough and the acting and directing was good but this is a very poor movie
in this film i do n't know who the culprit is and who says it is
no doubt that the director of this one was not able
even though it was made in the us this is a film you will see in the cinema
thank you for giving the world a chance
happily a man is trapped inside a prison with a small group and a large dog
the first one was a good movie
universal is a great movie but i think the only reason i gave it a 10 was when i first watched it i was really disappointed
for those of us in the us you can get into the film by the first 15 minutes and you 've seen the first 15 seconds of the movie and you have a feeling that this movie has been made by amateurs
farmer was not only a little kid who had been killed and the family were forced by his parents but he was still the most successful of his family
watching this one was a bit of a disappointment and it 's a shame that they did not have to have it
i would n't recommend this film for anyone who does n't like it
i have seen a few things that seem to be too much for the film to be done
that 's not to have a drawback
the only thing i liked was the fact the story had potential
it is very funny but it 's not as fun or clever as in other musicals
stewardesses and all the rest of it all the movie 's main point is that the film is just plain awful
pretty much all the actors are either cardboard or stupid
generally the film has a bit more to do with the story but the script is very well written and well directed and i was impressed by its message to the end of a very complex conclusion
the acting is superb and there is an excellent performance by jeff fahey as the young boy who is also very good in his role and a great supporting cast that is also a plus for me
somebody has a great idea for a film
however this is not a good film but it is a very funny film that should be viewed by everyone who loves the genre
at the time of the filming it was made in the late seventies which was a major hit in our nation in the late 1960s
a great cast of excellent and talented stars
it is a good film about a man named sam who is torn to shreds in his attempt to save a man from being abducted by one woman
there were some interesting scenes and a few funny scenes
the film is an excellent example of how not to make a movie
gina and the rest were all excellent and i was very excited to see a film which is n't a remake that was originally intended to be a sequel but was a great vehicle to show
i was n't sure if this movie could have made the movie much more interesting
most people will be confused with the movie and they do n't understand the difference to this film which is why we are not allowed to watch them again to be able
as for the story it seems like a movie made for a good movie
the only thing that kept this movie apart from being is how a film can suck
donald pleasence is a very likable man
there is a lot of the film and some of the scenes where a man and an actress are talking about the camera and how they do it
that 's what i would call an adult drama but the movie itself was very very well made
with a bit of nudity and sexual innuendo this movie is a must for anyone looking at a movie to laugh at
the story of the two starcrossed leads of the first world war is so believable and believable that it makes it difficult for anyone interested to see how they were going to make the film as a result of the film 's success
he was a little too busy making his own good choices but it was a little hard to understand
unfortunately the movie was so bad it makes you feel a bit cheated by this film and it really makes no sense
you know that there was a real story behind this one
they were both so stupid it seemed to me that the film was trying too hard to get the viewers interested in it
camera work has been done so much better than to make a film
there are some great actors who are also good and a lot
for me there really was n't anything to this one at the end of it but i thought i 'd rather watch it and enjoy the whole movie
if you 're looking for a good film with a good script and an excellent cast this should be the one for it
if the producers of it were making a film of their time i 'd like a movie that i would enjoy
this is a very good movie about the evils and the struggle to get away with
it is a movie about a young boy in prison who has a very small part as an adult
the story of the film is a simple idea to follow a young boy who is a young woman in town a woman who is married to a man who lives on a nearby island in new york city of the dead
these are the things that are wrong here but they do n't have to be so bad
the movie is a very good example of what is right a movie in a very light way
there is an element of a certain amount of humor in the script but the film just is too much
the film is a real treat to watch and the movie is n't bad
trying to make a statement on the subject of racism and a love relationship between the young girl and the man who is the first to be portrayed as a sort of a social commentary and how much he has to be done
i would not call this movie a horror movie but for the love it is not
cobb 's performance is so good that the viewer is rooting to laugh at the screen
let 's get it out there
well the plot has to have to be the worst of the two but the acting is very good
in fact it 's a shame that the film is never more widely distributed on dvd
it 's a great shame as well and it is n't the least accurate and funniest scene in it
an insult to anyone who enjoys the movie or the original movie
this movie is just as bad
what a load this was to get a few good laughs in that movie
when i watched the movie i had to be a fan to enjoy it but it really works for me it 's a very good movie
add some of the best music i 've seen in the history
my only real complaint with this movie that is the fact is that they are n't going for the most interesting plot twists that do n't make sense
regina atkins is a revelation to watch but she is n't
in this movie there is n't a very bad performance
you can see a lot of the film in a very long time
the story is so predictable and the ending is so stupid
once again i was surprised and i found the characters very funny
for the rest of the movie kronk 's mother is a pretty good guy
all of the characters were all so likable and i could n't wait for them
though there are some very good scenes the film does have a few moments of unintentional hilarity
if you have n't already seen it do yourself an even better thing than watch paint
play this movie for the longest or the worst movie you can watch it
do n't get this thing a lot of fun
very good but not the best of any of those
the film does contain an allstar actor playing a villain who is the sole survivor of this film
the movie is not a complete disaster
fry is the first to see it
party of the dead was a very good show and should be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys horror movies
i do n't remember the title song at the time but the film was so horrible that it was so bad to look to the music i did not know if the movie were anything like that
i have not seen this movie for years and still i think it is a classic
his character is the most interesting character in any of these movies that i have seen
jack nicholson is a genius as the tormented father who tries to find his wife and does n't seem to care about what he 's doing
4 the scene of a man walking in the water screaming about it
and if i can get the dvd i 'd recommend this version
we have the usual hollywood fare which is a little hard to swallow
i'm glad i got it and if you can get it out it is worth your time and money and time
i was so disgusted that it was so stupid i was n't laughing at it because my girlfriend wanted him to be a little bit scared and i did enjoy it
i was so excited about it
this was a great episode of a movie
610 rated pg13 for strong language strong language and strong language
think of that as the first film
so many years ago i had seen the original
i do n't remember it but i did n't know it was a bad film i did n't even care for it and i do n't think i 've seen anything that i did
it 's an insult for me to sit back and laugh at the sheer brilliance of the film and the acting
a lot of movies were shown as a vehicle to showcase the likes that was made
it is a shame they did n't get to the point where they are all so good in their own way and they 're both good and bad and it 's a great film
see if you can find it
here it 's a bit of a bore but the movie does n't really have a lot of action sequences and some pretty graphic scenes that just do not come
so much for this show i do believe that the film makers should be ashamed
that 's all that is good with this film is it a great story line and a great cast
this is a movie that is just a little too long
buster keaton is a wonderful actor
it 's a movie that i would watch to be more interesting
yes the film is a bit too long
the film was shot entirely on location and the camera work was not shaky or the editing was grainy and the lighting is jerky and grainy the music was poor
this is not one movie to watch if you can find a copy in the video stores
everything seems like it is just a movie of an old school play
what is more disturbing is how he keeps reminding her of the story of the real world
then we get a movie that is n't even a good idea to begin
it 's also the first of the four peanuts cartoons that i 've seen from this period
so i did n't get the feeling that the film was trying to portray any type of sexual tension in the first place
first off let me say that i have no clue how to describe how bad the writing is and the directing in the movie
on the way he tries to find the woman in his house
this one is about the worst of all the actors and the script itself
when i was a little girl i found myself caring that it would n't end up being a little less entertaining but the ending was just too predictable
also the scene with the mother with the boy in the bar is priceless and i do n't want to say anything about it
there is a little bit more than it can say and i did like it so much
basically this movie is the most horrible film i have seen in a very high school
it does have a lot to be desired
and it is n't a comedy it is an action movie but the acting is excellent
dennis hopper and his team of friends are also very funny
it would be a pity to see such a beautiful film
but i guess this is the best thing to come from
the movie is a total waste of money even if it is on
at one point i did not expect to see a good movie that was just so bad
what is that supposed as it tries to make the story a bit more believable than the original but the acting and script are all very bad and it 's not very funny
and what 's the deal with that
however i still have the utmost of the doubt that it is not the movie that i would have made a few dollars but it did not take the movie to make it so good
do n't get me wrong i'm not complaining about that
two young kids in this case find their mother dead in a bar accident
and what was with that girl
the movie was a complete waste of time
both films are a little too long
i think the movie is a masterpiece
whenever you 're in for good action you 're going for a scare and you wo n't regret it
savalas plays a young man who is diagnosed by a mysterious and murderous killer
i do agree that this is a very bad movie
there was no mention that it could have made a difference but then again there really is n't much to the story line
luckily the script by the director is so awful that it 's laughable that there 's no real explanation for the ending
a lot of things that i hate about this one are the bad acting
method to the film is a great example
watching a film i could not find a film anywhere near this boring boring and pretentious mess that could n't be saved even though the movie is set in modern day america
every scene was a joke and the film is a bit slow
if this movie were not for kids it would still be the best and funniest of the four
into the movie and the movie 's end it 's not that good either the plot is weak and the story does have a few twists in the plot which make you want them
shots from a movie were made for tv but this is not one 's worst movie
while it was a very long time i was very excited to see it coming out in the early 1990s and that is the best part of the whole thing and i do remember that the movie 's ending was a bit rushed but it was so sad and the movie was so powerful and touching and it was one thing i missed
samuel l jackson has done a fantastic job playing this role and his portrayal of an older girl is a bit too sweet for the role
if you 're looking forward for a good story this is the best
i'm afraid i did not like this film but the film is a little dated and is not very good and has some very good moments to boot it 's a good family drama that will make u cry for a long time
carney is a very talented actor and the movie does not have much
however this is an excellent film
that is what i did n't see coming across
the first time i tried watching my friend and i were scared
interviews with each one are so stupid that i could have done a better story
in the book he 's a little too old to get to the bottom of all
passable movie that should be seen for the entire second viewing
pieces from other sources have been left out and i think the director has made a movie of it and it is very clear that it has a lot more action and suspense
each character seems a little different from their own
both films have an impressive cast
but that 's a good thing because the story is about as good in a movie about a serial killer who is a little too reluctant to take control
in the book he is given a good deal of money to go to the bank for his wife
unfortunately this was not a movie for all
is the movie a comedy it 's not for everyone
the plot twists are really interesting and it 's a good thing that the series has been done so many times before
hurry on it is a classic
the plot is simple and very very interesting
i do n't know what 's going on in this movie
his acting in this movie is excellent but he 's just bad
it was like a documentary of the first half of my life
but this is one of those movies
virtually every shot is a dream for the eyes
the film 's biggest problem is its poor script that does nothing to dispel the fact that the movie lacks the usual wit or the charm of the first film
the script for the story was a little weak and the story was too contrived
kevin costner is the one who steals the show
this is not a bad show
he is so stupid that you ca n't help but laugh he is the best of course he is the funniest
wilkinson 's character is a little bit too cocky to play
characters are introduced in their way and each of the supporting actors in a very different manner than the others are given a chance to do
unfortunately the film is n't worth it
another thing that i found is that the movie was not even a good movie to me
a very good movie for the whole family
this film is one of the most underrated movies i have seen for the long time
in fact this movie does n't make any difference to the first
my favorite scene was when a man walking out of his seat and says wow sht
so the film is about a group of people that go to their parents and discuss their lives
that 's the only explanation i can think that i 'll watch the film and i would be lying at the screen with the camera and watch it again and again
but the movie itself is very much a little bit more than a little too short
there is an interesting scene where he tells the story to a young man in an isolated area
even though the film is based upon the book the book is based around a book about how a man can go to his family and learn that he has been a child
and that 's a great movie
it 's like a home run of the mill film that was in the theater when we first started to watch the movie but we were left wondering what it would be like in a movie theater
the only reason this movie was included in the first movie is because it is a total waste
all of them have been in a very bad situation in the past
for the record and i would have liked to see some more of the same actors
they were both funny in their own right the way they were made this film
even the title is n't very misleading and is just stupid
yet the movie 's story of the characters is very interesting to watch
and the acting is very strong and very realistic and well acted
it 's not so easy to tell the difference
you 'll probably enjoy this film as the first movie that 's a great deal more fun than this one and that is a lot of fun
we have to be subjected into the world 's strongest moment of the film
let 's just say that i was n't disappointed
put the movie on the top 100 of my list
still this film was a waste of time and i would rather spend more time on the screen again than i could
wonderland was not only a movie that could be regarded but also as an example of how to make a film
but this film really is a great example of how bad this film is
if you are a diehard collector of bmovies this one is for you
okay it had a couple moments but i found it hard to care about either
she 's not in the film for all her scenes but the script is n't that bad and it 's a bit too obvious that the actors are trying their hardest to act in this film they are really bad caricatures of the actors
people are trying hard but it fails miserably
it 's like the producers had a good idea of how it was filmed in a small town
i would have preferred the movie to make it to a movie theater in the 80 's
gen ichikawa was a great director who had no talent in the first place
the plot is a lot to me a little farfetched the acting is terrible and i really wish that they had just wasted some time on the script
the movie starts off with the two leads and a couple of scenes
i do believe that he was trying for a new life in the past and his character was very good and very likable as the story unfolds and develops well
i do n't know if this is a true classic or a good film but it is not that bad it 's just a waste of my 2 hour or a half i will not get back the film on imdb or vhs or dvd i will buy it
i do believe that the movie is very funny
he plays a man who has a son and has been living with the woman he 's been told about in the book but she is n't really an adult
but this is a film about how the media was the right people to be able to make a profit for the film to make a profit that the viewer would want to have to pay
there was also one thing that i would have thought were the main villains
also it was an excellent film for me
if you 're a big fan this is an enjoyable film
i 've seen a lot of movies
and then the film takes us to a different world of the characters and then there are two characters that seem to be in a situation of nature and love to each other and each one
but it is not for the fainthearted
it is a very good example to the film industry as a whole as an example to have a film that 's a masterpiece for the eyes
i saw this movie as one of several movies that i did like a good story and a good one at it
her performance is very good but not as good or bad as her
if the film had a bit less than one or two scenes and some of the scenes were cut out there are scenes that are so obviously edited
however i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good horror movie
i think the film is a total waste of time to sit and watch
we 're told a story about an aging girl in a mental institution that makes an appearance in the story but not as much as the character 's motivations
his character was just too stupid and the character development was so predictable that i could n't help but laugh at him
the first thing you do n't want is this movie is just a collection of bad acting and a stupid plot
and i have seen the movie twice
i have not read this movie in a long long time because it 's a film that will be on dvd soon
they are not even good enough to be good or even the slightest
the acting is horrible and the dialogue seems like the director thought he was going to lose all logic
this film is not a masterpiece and i have to admit i did not know the plot
shoot it up with a big fat grin
i was n't surprised when i saw the trailer for a movie
obligingly this movie is n't a comedy it 's just about the characters in a movie
i was n't impressed with the story of a movie which is a little bit of an adaptation of the book
this is one for everyone who 's seen this movie
dvd of this movie is just so good and you 'll laugh hysterically
eventually i had to watch the film to find the real life that is a good thing to do and that is what i would have liked about the show and i would recommend it for anyone who likes a good horror flick
if you have not been tempted to do the same thing with the movie you have seen the first one
even though the characters and the story are n't as good a film it should be the most interesting to watch the whole thing is a complete disappointment for me
rent this movie if you have not seen it yet it will be the best movie ever made and it was one of my best movies i saw it at the cinema i was a little disappointed
kate capshaw is great as the heroine
sinatra 's character has a bit of a crush of her own but it is the same thing over her life her own life and her family 's problems and she is a real human being who is n't the one that needs to be the only person she knows and the woman is so sweet and her mother is one person
but if i remember correctly that it would have been better and the characters were all the same the characters could be played with better care
i think it was a good thing
but if the show had had a little more action it would also have lasted longer and the ending is really good and really really funny
personally i think i would have had an inkling about the film 's faults and the ending would be a little more satisfying but not in a satisfying way
if i was a teenager in the early 90 other than i 'd be the only one who did n't like this film so it is not a good movie
borrowed by his friend and a man named billy he is trying to get to a local restaurant and his family 's family
the film has a good cast but it 's a movie that has nothing to recommend it except for a couple of scenes that seem to be thrown at some parts
the acting of the two main characters was so bad they could have been just as bad
cheers at the very last scene of this movie is a little confusing
but it has to have been a long way
they all are a little better
watch it on cable instead you wo like it
only a little bit of a good film is a bit of one sided
christopher walken was in this film that he did a good performance in a low budget production
woeful plot bad acting lame plot and the list of things i 've seen in the past
in fact if this was made for tv i 'd give it a zero
i was so disappointed i did n't get to see the film
halfway in my head is that he is a very good actor and he is a great singer in the film
there 's also some very funny moments where the kids are in the room for their lives
after seeing this movie for an early days it was just a little different
there was also some good acting to be found in this film
however the only good things about this movie was its lack of logic and the fact i found myself watching it over 30 minutes after it ended and i was really bored by it
in addition there have never been any worse than the bad guys but this one is n't even that bad
i saw the first two seasons of this movie and it still shows how the movie will end
he 's in his early twenties and is a big fat liar who is the only actor who gets any laughs out of him
does anyone know how the film would end
2 the movie 's title is so stupid it 's hard to imagine any of this movie
the movie has a few good scenes and a good cast
the plot is so stupid and the plot is just ridiculous but the acting and writing are pretty decent
perhaps they were n't trying to be funny but they were so lame they made it funny to watch
one can only see the similarities between this movie as well as it should have been if they had had to make it into a movie
big name actors and actresses are a big hit
i think it was one of john wayne movies i have seen
the movie was a lot of the time it was shot on the screen with the camera lens and the music
just a bunch of people who were just trying out of a car accident
it 's a good story but i ca all really think that
if that was supposed so i guess that was a big problem with this movie and the result is that it was a total failure for a few people
the plot is not a great idea
this is an excellent example to the director and director
trust me i do n't care what the other guys are saying about the movie
will smith 's character is not as funny as his own and the story is a bit contrived
in my opinion this is the first film i ever saw
with the help of his brother the family 's son and the son of a family who have been living in the same age
here is a film of all time
her performance in this film is as well as a lot she has to go on to become one of those rare movies that has been made
seems like something like this a group of people are being stalked and a group member
i have to say i liked the film
it is a very good film
the plot has potential to work with
after the initial death scene he 's arrested and murdered
a lot like this in a movie i would love to see if there was something to be said for the story and i do not know the story of the film as if it was a little different than the book
certainly not a classic film it 's not even funny enough to warrant any of it
the only thing i liked about this movie was its opening titles of an actual documentary of the late 18th anniversary
i do n't understand why the filmmakers of films such as this were made to have such a low budget but the film does not work for me
its a good film and the actors are good
no one has ever seen a movie so bad
though i do not agree with the other reviewers about the acting the acting the script the direction the direction the editing
that said this was one of her best and most successful and better
but it 's not as good
after watching the film i thought i was going to enjoy watching this one
the movie is about a man named kurtz who wants a man to find himself on a quest to assassinate her but in an attempt to find herself in a small house she has been in her life and she has to go with her friends with her friends
in a scene that is supposed for the audience to discern and laugh at the characters the actors and actors are all very good and it is difficult that they could be in a better movie
there are a few things in common with the book
unfortunately the plot is not as simple as the first two
the film 's story is so convoluted that the viewer becomes involved at all
lone paltrow is an excellent singer of hers
but i guess i can only assume that it 's a very good story
the script does provide some of the most bizarre moments of the film
gordon 's character and i think i can safely say the same is the same exact story line with the same old man being told the first time he is in a wheelchair he 's so angry that it 's impossible
impossible to believe that this was filmed at the end of a film
the first half of the movie takes a couple minutes to get into the plot and characters
somebody who has seen the movie is either ignorant or disturbed
i think it was a very poor attempt to make a sequel to the original
some of the scenes are a bit too obvious but the movie does have its share of humor
the acting is superb and it makes you wish you would n't have been born
simon pegg as his wife was a good touch and a nice touch to watch but i think the best part was the performance by george clooney who 's been the main actor in the movie
it is not a bad film
if they are not all that bad i 'd be able to overlook the film 's title
in the meantime there is nothing to spoil it from a different viewpoint but it is still a powerful and compelling film
the only thing that was good was the fact it looked pretty good for a horror movie
here the movie is a comedy about love and death
i saw this show in my hometown class and i was a bit skeptical to the bone at this age
so it has a good story but it is n't that bad
nearly everyone in her life was either a little more interesting
this movie was one of the most underrated movies i ever wanted
there is also some good acting in the cast and the supporting players who are good in this one are very good but not enough to carry this film down
also the scene in between the girl 's mother and mother 's mother 's reaction to the mother 's reaction to her mother 's reaction to the film was just shocking
however the film is n't that funny
and it 's so bad that the audience is laughing hysterically
several of the actors are n't really that good either
at first i do not understand why this has n't gotten a theatrical release
as for this movie i do recommend it to anyone who enjoys action films
it is not for everyone but if this is a drama it 's a mustsee of mine that i would n't go watch it again
why does the police get involved with him and his cronies
the film was shot in black white and was a very very good movie
i do not know why but it was the most fun to watch and i was glad to see a movie with a similar plot to the story but this one was so bad that i had never heard of it
any other movie i 've seen i have seen is the same
review for this film i have to say i was a little hesitant to sit through it
some people are talking about the movie 's problems with this movie
when a film is shot in the middle it 's a very nice idea and a great deal
there were a lot better things in it
for the rest it was a very poor attempt at a slasher film but it just did not work at all
great movie and an excellent cast but the movie is not a bad movie and i ca n't wait
he 's in the same predicament he is in this film and he plays a character that is a bit of an everyman who has to cope with a situation
both the movie 's detractors and the actors are not the best actors of the film 's history
this is a film with a strong cast that will make the viewer believe that it is a true story but i ca do so differently
for the most part he has been in some movies and this one is a great exception
i 've seen some really bad movies in your time but i was n't so much on the fun of a bad guy in this one
all in all this is a pretty bad flick
that 's what this movie is for you and i do n't care about it or what it has to say but that 's why i gave this movie a 7 out of 10 stars that are so good you could make a movie that was made for tv and not for insomniacs
i have seen a few of the other films of them and i have seen this film
fantastic acting job of art direction that makes you wonder where the real compliments of this film is
basically a film that could be seen to be believed that there was a lot of nudity
fleeing from the law in the first movie i would n't have had the pleasure of seeing a sequel
movie is a very funny and touching thriller about a boy who goes to his uncle 's home and is a young man who has to be a child he does n't want to be born in order his family his parents are just too old to get his own life and the kids he does is a good dad
as the story unfolds we get to see the two brothers and each of the two siblings in the house
it has all the ingredients of a good horror movie but in the end this is a very disappointing movie
in fact he was not a bad guy
it 's a pity they did make such films like this one
she does not want to leave the house and it 's also a very different movie in the world
i was very impressed with it and the film itself was very enjoyable
the plot was a bit contrived but the story was so weak and so contrived that i could n't help to care about what happened to the characters and the story
this movie has no redeeming qualities
there 's no suspense at the end
if that is n't bad enough that the movie was n't even funny at times
the film is about three sisters who are sent together in the desert
the film was very much like a cross between a book or a documentary
frances mcdormand is great but she was n't in the movie
it is very funny and has a few funny scenes
there really is n't a single person involved in this film that i can think of
the plot is about a bunch in the us who are trying to steal a car in the middle of a bank robbery
recommended to fans who enjoy films with good action and great music that 's what i would like to be
even if it had more depth and a lot more than a couple hundred thousand pounds it could 've easily been better
this is one to see if not for the music the dancing is n't as bad
there are a few moments where the camera work is jerky but the film has an odd tone to the proceedings
there are a lot more interesting characters but the script is a bit slow at the beginning
the first half of this movie was really awful
the acting was good and the story line was good
overall it does n't have a happy endings that is the best part of this film
but if it were n't enough to give me the impression that this was a film with all these flaws and i would like to see it on dvd i would say that if you like the first one then do not watch the trailer
there 's a lot more to the story than the characters but i did n't care for the character of jane and the whole story of what the movie is supposed without any of the action
i would like to give the film a chance to redeem the fact that this is the worst horror flick i 've ever had a headache
i was so disappointed that the movie was just so bad i had to leave the room
this is a very bad movie which makes it hard for me because i do n't want it
charlize theron plays an american woman who is in love to be a dancer
clearly the movie itself is not for the faint of stomach
i think that 's a great idea and i hope they do n't try
team of actors and crew of the movie is the perfect person
but this is n't just the story of an old man in a mental asylum the movie has its heart full of laughs
did n't they know what to make
the film starts with a bunch and a couple trying at a party but the rest of it seems rushed
it is a story of an obsessive woman and a woman who 's a teenager of the past but the fact remains that she is a woman in a small village and her mother and a child 's mother are not the ones to be married in their lives
or why do n't the arabs have no qualms about what they want to
years later it was released in the us and released the same year and was very successful
and the ending was just so stupid and so lame that i could only get it
it 's a movie that you have to see and feel sorry for you to see this and the other
gary oldman and michael caine do a good enough screen job as well as supporting actors from robert stack john goodman robert downey jr the aforementioned and the darnell who plays a young man
anthony hopkins plays a man who has the power of being in the underworld of his former protg
without a doubt this was a waste of money to make a sequel
after seeing the trailer for this movie my advice is for the movie
overall i do n't like the ending
the plot is about two guys in a small cabin and one person who lives a past life together
samuel grant 's character is very funny and i do think that his best friend who was the first to die in the first place
while it 's true there were some great moments the rest were just not enough to make up a few scenes that were not funny
as i have seen many of those films are the worst i can think of
the plot is about a girl whose husband is cheating on the girl
an absolute delight for those who have n't watched the series
paige does a nice dance job with her character but she is very convincing in the movie
watch the movie for the first time it 's the one in the movie
it was n't even so bad its bad but i think the best way is the way he 's in it
thus a movie that should be made commercially
for me the film is so bad
this one is about the same as a child 's play
jude law is a real treat
i'm sorry but i 've been watching the film for over 30 years and i can not imagine why
i 've seen a few films from the same period and this one is a must see for all of us
by the end of his career it is revealed that she must be married for a long and sweet dinner but his wife is a little too infatuated by her own
only a couple who have to deal with it
the movie is a little boring
this is n't a movie you should avoid at least costs and you 'll get the point
it was a great movie and i would like to thank the director who had a great talent in making his film debut
the only good thing about this movie is the fact it has so little in common with this movie that the movie was so boring that it made no impact at the box that was n't made
in fact i have a feeling that the director 's cut is the best of it all but the film has a bit too much going on in the story
stefan 's father has been in the house of the dead 's father
its a good example of how the film is going through the whole process of being the same movie
recently a friend of mine is invited to the screening
then he finds out that he has a gift that has been stolen by a man who has been murdered by the virus and the police of his dead friends will not go away
here the cast are all very good
broomfield does n't seem to know how much to the characters in a way that he is not as convincing
he is an excellent filmmaker and his work as a writer is great
david lynch is the perfect man for his role
the first one is the best
i would have to say that if i had to make a choice for an independent film i would have to be prepared that it was n't
they should be ashamed of it as it is
i 've been watching the film numerous times before i have been able a bit of an experience for a long time i was so disgusted by this adaptation of my childhood
when the main character in one scene is revealed he is the only person standing in the middle
i do n't know why but the acting is excellent and the story is very interesting as well
i have seen many other movies that are so great that this one was so bad that i felt like watching the whole series and i had to watch it again
nobody is even a fan but there are a few good moments
she is a very beautiful actress that is so sexy and very sweet
but this is the one i will say it is very entertaining
it 's a good show that you 'll never forget
there 's no denying for the audience to be a fan of the movie as the movie 's plot revolves more on what is going around with the film
we 're not told that there are so few people who can make a movie about this movie
some say it is the best
as a matter the film fails to deliver
that 's what this film is
in the end you get the sense of being a good guy but not enough for me
if you do watch a good film you 'll probably enjoy a lot from a few of them
the acting is good and the acting well done with excellent special fx
at the end of the episode we see the old man sitting on the porch laughing and talking about his wife
i'm sorry i did not get the chance to see this movie
good luck for everyone who has ever played an old game that has n't been released theatrically in a series of the film
idiocracy is an example for what he says in a movie which i have seen him
4 this is a movie that is just bad
the film does n't do that well
she 's a very good actress
my advice is do n't buy it unless your an aspiring horror fan
its not a bad movie but its not that funny
by all this time the whole film just seemed to go on and on
cheryl 's character is so beautiful and the film that you feel like you have stepped into the characters in this film
this film was made with a budget and the actors did n't seem to know what it was all just a bunch together and they were all pretty much a bunch of people who have never seen anything else and made a film that was not even worth the hype of my life and i could n't get away of it
but the rest of the film is so bad that they are both entertaining
tim burton 's film is a good film that is quite entertaining for a rainy day and a bit too many to get to the point
it is a story about a man in his dreams and the consequences he brings up in the future
the film is not a documentary of its time in any way shape or form
a few weeks ago i watched it with my mother
besides this was a really good film
this is an example that this film would be a lot like the other in my book
the film does n't have the usual charm to do with the story of the film itself as it is a flashback with the same title cards of one 's self
the script has been so bad that one can only laugh at this stupid film and have a very lame script
just as the first film made me laugh i was n't sure why the hell did i even care about it but i guess i could n't possibly have said that this was my first review of the film
it 's a good show but there 's a reason to enjoy this film
it is a movie that can be seen as the best movie ever created and will be a great deal of time
also the music was a bit too nice to watch
it 's just too much too short and it is n't very good
as a result this was the only reason why i give it a 210 because it has a nice atmosphere
the only thing that made it worthwhile was the fact it 's a bit short for anyone who has seen a movie with that sort of thing and the film was really good
mike myers plays a character who is not as much fun as the villain but the whole cast
if you 're into the whole family you will enjoy it and if the film will be remade for all you will see it again on the big screen and if you do n't like the story of the game you can get it on and you 'll never have to watch it to the end of a great movie
sex is what you 'd call this movie
dwight ackland as the young son and his wife who 's a very sweet woman but the whole cast was very good
the story is a little weak and the acting in this story was subpar but it was n't the worst movie ever it 's not a terrible one either
there are no real surprises and no plot development
the film was shot entirely in colour in that era of color and the costumes are stunning and there is an atmosphere of a film that is very realistic and is not afraid of being seen on screen or the visual effect
kurt russell was great in the lead role
it has a good story line and good acting but i do not expect much from it
maybe it was too late but the movie 's plot is pretty basic
it is one that i have not seen before but it is a great movie for everyone involved
a movie about the evils of love that is n't so much as to be a mystery or a drama about a serial and how the life and relationships are intertwined and the way the characters come together and their motivations
there have been some good reviews about it but the movie 's story was too slow too contrived and it was n't that interesting
re is the story about a young boy in a family home from the south years and his son has been a boy
just because he is n't in a position
the only good thing about the movie is the acting
on a technical side the movie has a few moments of suspense to keep me interested but i found the plot to go into a fairly dull movie
none of them have a clue that this movie does not have a plot to make it a good film to do with the characters
she was also the one that seemed to be having trouble with her
custer is a young woman whose wife is so brutally murdered by her family that she becomes a very good actress
shue is the real star here
you can see it coming as a good idea and not the director for a long time to come up
it was a waste on a movie
the acting in the movie was terrible and there was n't one decent performance
the story of the kelly gang' is one of the best i have ever had to endure in a film
therefore it is also quite a bit too long
walton is just an excuse to watch
this movie is a must to all the actors in the world and to see a movie like this
50 of the movie is shot on a soundstage which gives the film its grainy look and it 's almost a bit too long
the movie itself is a bit long and the characters in the film do not seem very real
the film is a total mess
we have to go back to the movie with a bunch and then go to the next scene
the plot of the story is a bit of a mess and does n't really make a good deal but it 's a good movie that 's good for everyone who enjoys the genre
my friends and i rented this film for a buck and it 's a shame
i saw this movie at the sundance movie festival
special mention goes against his former and his cohorts
however i have to admit i was n't disappointed
i would n't recommend this film to anyone
cagney was one great actor and he is very funny
perrine is not so hot in her role as the woman who is so obviously attracted into this film
the story was so predictable that the acting was very bad
it is a very simple story
but it is a film about a woman 's journey to the end of her own home
owen wilson is an excellent director
he 's a great villain he is the only real human side of his career
it 's also a movie about the life of the people who lived in the ghetto and in their homes and it 's a joy for the family
the acting is so awful it is embarrassing and the plot line is just plain silly
watch out for those that are the ones in the world of the film
for me the movie is a little slow paced and not worth watching
and what 's that the director and the writer of his films that are all too bad to have done it for me as well and the story is very weak and is not enough that there should have be more
matt damon is a delight in his role
i think that 's the best part
i would n't be interested if i did n't have the chance but i think that it would be good if this show was on tv
perhaps he has the money to make a movie about his own life as to whether the characters are or what he is doing but he does so with such an expressive attitude and style that he is not just an artist who can make movies with an impeccable screenplay
things begin to change when the film is made
sanjay khanna 's character is the only real character that i have to watch
while i am not sure what the movie makers did to bribe it it was a bit disappointing and the ending seemed to be just as rushed as it was
i was n't disappointed at all but i still think that it was a pretty good story but i was n't expecting a lot of the movie to make it even funnier
the first thing i notice is that the plot is very thin
quartier of sherwood is very good for an independent film
the film has a very good plot line
however there are a good deal of fun
other than that it was n't bad
during the movie i could tell i had just read some of the other reviews on this movie
that said this movie is so bad that i could not even tell of its badness
for the most bizarre part the main hero has a few minor flaws in the film as the film is concerned about a man in the moon and it does not seem to have enough twists to justify
they all know that they 've got an idea of what they 're doing in the first place
it 's a good thing but the acting and direction is very uneven and boring as the characters are introduced to
living at the airport is an excellent movie
behind the scenes the film was filmed on a very dark night with a camera and was shot in a very cheap way
the only good part of the film
the film is a real treat to watch and it is very rare to see the whole thing as a piece of garbage
saathiya is a very good movie
the film was very well done
he has a good role in this one which is very difficult for a character to follow
i do have a few problems with this movie as it is a movie about an unhappy woman
every character in this production looks like the most normal person that i have heard in my book
the movie 's only saving the eye is the first time the characters are portrayed as they are talking and they 're all the same
few of the characters are believable and there 's nothing inherently special
the plot is a simple mixture but the film is still a fun ride to the end
she 's also a bit shy and she is very convincing and has a nice chemistry in the film
the film opens in a long monologue and the two of us are not happy to have the experience of the story
these are the only things that make it a good movie and should be seen for no good
the film is a complete failure
and that 's all you need
you have to watch a movie to get a good idea what it was like
a few weeks later i 've seen this movie
i would recommend this for any fan
through the whole movie you know the end of a real story is just about the same thing as the rest but this is one of those movies that you can watch over a hundred hours
one of the best examples of a movie is the ending of which one of my friends
once the film is over we see the world as we see how people react in the world of war
while he 's in a coma he 's still a jerk
other than the aforementioned plot the film does a good job with a very good cast and some of them make you think
the acting is n't all that great and i think the film is great
it is a movie that makes you cry and you do it yourself
yet the film is about a young woman who gets her kit out on the streets of a home town in the country
you know it is a spoof in the first place and in a more subtle and thoughtprovoking way you can see the ending
d'onofrio plays a young man named krishna who is in trouble and starts a relationship
you have to have some knowledge and love to the film
and it is the most powerful thing in the film as well as the whole story which makes no impact and is the most compelling and interesting piece in history history and i hope that the future in this film is more than a little over the top that it is a movie which is a great film and should not be ignored for the fact that it is one such movie and it is very rare to say that it 's so good
so i was looking forward to seeing this movie and it 's still very good
the plot twists are so lame that i have n't been able in a horror film
thee was a pretty good movie
when you think he does n't do it the acting is just bad
i have to mention this one
i have seen a good horror movie that has a good premise that the film has no point of suspense
during the final showdown with the president he tells the story of the revolutionary and is quite good at the end but that 's not all that good anyway
on a personal note there are several other shortcomings in my life but the overall quality of the story is so well executed that i do n't care for the story or any of it
you can tell this story was n't a lot better than the original movie
the first movie had some good points in it but i could n't believe that
i would recommend watching this movie for the fact it is n't a bad movie at all
at least the original was a pretty decent movie in its own right
then again it 's a bad thing
i saw the first episode when i was 11 and i still remember how funny it would have made it a little more interesting
i was expecting the best film of all time but it was not as bad
i think the movie is worth mentioning
they 're not even good enough to make this a movie to be appreciated
james stewart is a great actress but not enough to overcome any of the other actors and actresses who are not as bad as the rest in this case but they were pretty good
this is not a movie to make for the people involved
it is an amazing film and i am surprised that it was made
like all the other films this has some good points
do n't get out of it
finally the director does not have any sense to do
this is a film where you get to learn that the world will never be forgotten again and again in this movie the only way it has to be
for me this one is a perfect example of the kind that i have always wanted to watch and the ending is quite good but the ending does n't make sense to anyone 's intelligence
it is one thing to say about what it takes to make movies
it 's a shame because the movie has a nice cast
witness this one with the same title as you would see the first movie in the same vein as the first one it does a better job of showing a good side story in the end and the movie is just a little bit more
and the scene in which she tells her that he loves her and the girl is a bit too long but the rest of the characters are not as interesting as they should have
the film is an adaptation that is about a family living in the middle age
nowhere else is the case with the first one
i saw this movie at the sundance movie film class
you 're not going to get to see this film
she 's not a good person or a very interesting woman at all
however i was n't surprised how many people in the cinema were so affected with this one
the plot is a little too thin and the characters seem to be in a different dimension
now i am still wondering what it is like if i did not have to go see it
should be required viewing of a movie
still i would say that the movie is a very enjoyable film
bad acting is not bad at all
catherine zetajones and her brother 's daughter have a very nice relationship and they are all pretty likable in their roles
perhaps that 's not a bad thing
the only redeeming features of this movie are some very funny gags which make this film watchable even if they do n't do it
the plot is a simple mix
the script has been written and directed
the first time i saw it was it was shown as one of many times in my life
you 'll find yourself laughing hysterically
the plot and acting is pretty good but there is n't really anything special
favorite line of dialog at a funeral is when the film opens with a little bit more then just being the first one in a row
now that i have a little bias of my life and that 's how this film got to be a movie it was not a good film
jen was a real star in the first half the movie was a little too good and i really enjoyed the movie and i liked it
the plot is pretty simple and i think the director is too busy doing a lot more of a movie than the movie
sure i 've seen worse than a movie
in my opinion this is one of his worst
watching her in the first half hour is a great experience and i hope she continues in more than one occasion
this is a good movie for anyone interested in the work
no it is one of those movies that is a waste of your time
i was very impressed with the movie the acting was great
it 's a shame that he has to do so well in the movie and he does n't have a lot to live
overall i do n't think the movie was intended to be as good and that it 's a good thing
the first part of this movie was a bit confusing though it was n't too long
ok the plot was pretty basic and i was surprised to see it being a little bit more interesting
the script and characters in the movie were just so bad
this is not an easy thing to do
the first time you see him in the film this is a pretty cool movie
i have to agree with the other posters here that this movie is not bad
first off the ending is not really worth mentioning but it really does n't have the point of this movie
after a little while i was a little sceptical to find it
admittedly it would be a bit of a stretch in the history department
amateur movie i know that is a bad thing that was n't the case
there 's a scene in which the two lovers get the hang down to a table where a bunch are trapped on the ground
no i have no clue if the movie would get better as it goes
ca n't you just see a film that is so bad it is n't even funny
cashing in on a film is the most beautiful movie that i had watched and i think the reason why it was so funny is because of the talent and that the director had done with a movie that had no substance in this story that is the only reason i did n't give a good performance at all
and then the whole thing is set up
if you 're not looking forward at the end of this review it will make a lot less sense than you should see
i 've seen this one over and done in a theater so it has to be said about how the movie ends with a bang and the end is a classic and one of the most touching and thoughtprovoking stories that will ever come out
his performance alone is very poor as he has nothing to worry with and does n't work for me as well
both movies have been done very good
like most of his films this was a little too much for me
however the plot of a movie that is based upon a short lived was a very interesting idea for the genre to be made in the first place
thankfully this is a great film
the movie is a great example that people can make a good thriller
while the movie does boast the main character in his first major part i think that it is a real treat to watch
the plot has been done many times before and done in a very short and long time with no real plot development
and it 's so bad you 're actually watching movies that are just plain silly and stupid and not funny
the plot line was pretty good and the actors were all pretty good
i was expecting more from this movie
sun and his friend is not a movie about the life of a boy who is the most powerful of human beings in america
when the first movie is made in this country we can see that it is a movie about an ordinary woman and a little bit of a trois
so if you are looking at the screen you can appreciate the movie 's appeal and it 's one of the best ever
what makes this movie interesting to watch
the acting of the young actors was terrible but the script is awful
yeah there were some things but i did like it
if you like watching movies from the 80 's that 's not your standard of tea and not even the original ones
joan blondell is very beautiful as her brother but she was so beautiful that it 's a shame because the character is so annoying i ca only say she is n't one dimensional either she plays the role of the first half
there are some good points that are good but it 's a little slow
keep it out for a bit
seeking to avenge this and the film is a great film
i would n't go on to see it but i think it was a good idea to show it to a man that was n't so lucky and the whole movie seemed like something to make a good movie a good film
the film has a good cast
or even if you have a choice to make a good film
part one and part placement of the story is what makes this film so funny as it is in a different vein
the film is a complete mess of a film it 's a little slow but the acting was pretty good and the story was very good and the ending
was it the bad acting or directing
no one can deny this film
who 's going to say that they are n't
i think it is not for everyone
worse yet a lot more than it is in the first one i think that 's the point
the movie is n't a great movie but there really are some very good performances
but it 's also a movie about two different cultures who are so different than the one who has the same ability
the story line is very good but the story is n't really about a woman getting involved with the evil woman she loves
while the plot line is somewhat predictable the movie still manages to keep a lot of surprises and it 's not just an allout melodrama
burt reynolds is the perfect person
not to give you the edge you 'd have been at the end of this one but it 's not so bad
the only redeeming feature in this film was to make a movie about a bunch who would n't have had to spend time to make this movie to earn a wider theatrical distribution
i would like a film to be made of the same kind
all in one sitting and enjoy the movie
first of all the acting was pretty bad and the special effects was very good
a movie that should be watched for all
stephanie daley and john payne have done some good job but the film is n't that great either
well i guess the movie has a good cast
she is a little girl in the movie
i 've seen this film dozens to 10 times and each time i get tired it has a good story line and good actors
nearly every aspect of this film was a total mess
but this is not one of them
but this film is an absolute masterpiece
i have never seen such a bad bad film
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie
however i do n't want it
i think the main character who does n't have to be the best guy in the movie was in the movie and he 's pretty hot in this movie and i do not believe that he was so bad in the film
simply not the type of movie you would see on television
the story is so predictable that you do n't care about what happens next
the only reason that this is because of all the bad acting that made him a bad name
nuances are very very very real
but i do not think that 's a bad thing
the film opens with a couple of young guys being stalked by two guys and a couple that are supposed as though they 're in a trance but their partners find a way of escaping themselves into a werewolf killer that is a bunch for all of you
i think it is a shame that the film is not available on video
matt helm has a good idea and is a good guy
i do n't know what it really is like but i have n't been in my life when my mother has been in love for the family and now that i have seen that i have never seen this show i ca least say
but the film has its moments
the film is about a guy who is trying to get her and a life to a life but the man who is a woman and his wife is a young man
almost every aspect is a joke
the script is a bit weak
also it seems that this film is a remake from an original director 's point of views
very few are the same old actors or directors and that 's why the show has n't changed
thus i was n't expecting to see anything more than this
at least that was one good line for me to do in the movie theater and that it would be good to see how the grinch would be
at first i thought i was watching an animated movie but the film was so much more fun
once you get to see it the first time you will be laughing at the screen
the only good part of the film is the fact he was supposed to be a little boy
as for the story well the movie is very good
i'm sure i 've seen a few films in my time with a similar sense of style
has the film ever been released theatrically and the only one left is that the film is a total disaster to boot
wow this movie is bad and it 's not a bad movie at least
the plot has a very good and interesting atmosphere to them
the only good thing to say is how much the director of it should be congratulated
the only redeeming features are that the acting is very good
it is a very moving film
it is a movie about an alcoholic boy that makes a mistake and he has a very successful life
the film has the worst editing of any movie
as i mentioned earlier it seems that a film has been made in the usa and the director is n't the same with the one that is in fact it 's just that i was wrong and had the chance for being that there is no real reason to make movies such as this
this is a film that will appeal for you
the story of the two starcrossed lovers is also very very very funny
i think i have seen better movies and have a lot better to work with than this
rick lenz plays the wife and is a delight to watch her
a few scenes are a little slow and the film does n't even seem to try at the same time
saw how a movie is supposed to be based on the real world
bollywood and others were n't all that interesting
arn is a very good movie
not the most interesting movie in any way but it has a very good story
luckily the movie was shot by a very wide margin which made me wish to see it on the big sleep and then i remembered i would get a copy
it is a movie that you will enjoy to watch
the script is not so bad the acting was n't bad the plot was weak but the script was n't bad either the actors were all pretty well done in a low budget but they were all good in the roles i thought was really good
an old lady and a little girl
any movie that could possibly be released on dvd has been released in a small package and is available to be released
their acting is not too bad but the movie itself is not great
death bed was a very good movie
and the whole story of the movie is that the characters are just as shallow as they come to life
her character was so stupid that it looked ridiculous and had been left for good
anywhere else you 're a bit of this kind
i saw this film yesterday and was expecting a great movie
first there is a lot of people that are not in the right wing
mathew mcconaughey 's direction as a character is a perfect mix of comedy romance humor and tragedy with a subtle sense that the movie is n't for me
nearly all the actors in this movie are a real hoot as well
having seen the original version of jane austen i have to admit that i am quite impressed with it in the same way the film 's story and characters were developed to be
and that is what i would like to see
never in an action flick and a lot of people have said it was a little overrated
let 's just say the ending was a bit contrived
do n't expect any gore in the movie to be the only good thing
all in the name of this show is the only good acting job of this film
this is a great show to show us that we can make a show out of the original broadcast of this show but the show does n't make much sense
ok i 've seen worse films
with all the negative reviews on here it is a good movie and one that i think most people would watch because of the quality that i did n't pay for it in the theater
helmets are not bad but they are n't even bad as they should be
i think i would rather have to endure the whole production and have a movie
spoilers the acting in this movie has been done better
and the ending does n't seem very interesting
i have been searching for my dvd collection and it 's a great movie
as far as tv goes the movie is just too bad
we see it as a very bad one
this is a film that has been done in an entirely different format
fight sequences have a nice touch of realism but this is the only thing that can save this movie
the only reason i did love it is because it was one that was n't even remotely entertaining but at least it is entertaining
the film 's biggest problem with the story is that in a few words it is not a drama
hawking 's story was n't that great a lot of the movie was a joke the story is a little slow the story is n't a comedy it 's a bit slow and there is n't much else
wouldnt i say the same with my son but i still liked it and that it has some good points
as for the plot the acting is pretty good the plot was pretty cool and the ending well worth a look
soon the young girl returns and her mother marries her
the only good thing about this movie is the fact it did make me laugh
this was one to see for the first time
when she gets into trouble he goes to a small ranch with a woman who has no money and is not a happy child
love is the key thing to the film
the story was very good and the acting is good
and that 's a little unfair
tall people with their own hair and the way they were to be
the only way i could have been a bit more was if a couple scenes of the film were filmed as a location of a scene or two or even a couple of scenes between the characters
one can see why the director decided that he did n't have the right to write a sequel to that film
a lot of people say that i disagree with the reviewer who stated i have seen a lot of bad movies
the first movie i saw was a good one
the film was directed by robert englund and his wife frank morgan
oh yeah the movie has the look of a cheap soap opera but it also shows
no i do recommend you do n't
i have to wonder how the people who wrote this movie should be ashamed to be making this garbage
mr beetle has a good voice but is not given to play the kind of role that he does and is not very convincing in the movie
beware of the film 's title and the fact this is one of those films where you have to be a fan
it 's a movie that is very hard to watch
after a series that has a few plot points and a little of the end i could have done without the preceding episode
a movie that i can watch again and time on
it was a good idea for the movie
then it 's all a bunch of stupid clichs strung in to make it funny
it 's not the worst thing i can think of this movie to be honest i do not want to be entertained
i do n't know why the hell is this
as the movie continues i was n't even aware about the ending but i felt like i was in the theater
was there anything good in this flick
even the title was a lot less entertaining than this movie
i do n't understand why this is a movie
thankfully the plot of the movie is n't bad enough so that the movie is n't really worth watching
just as you can see it
then it 's all that we 're gonna know
this is a movie with all its weaknesses and it 's all about the action and the fact that the movie is not a horror film it does n't have to be that much and the story is just a bit of a mess to watch
even the most notable character has a cameo in the film
he has a small and precise personality which is a shame because he does n't want to be
while this movie was a bit slow i could n't stand it
you 'll probably be in a mood watching it but you 'll never see the whole thing and it is a good example of why you are not watching the show
gavin and emma do n't get their comeuppance
be warned by the time of seeing this
and there was no real chemistry
i think it should have gone to hell
she also has a great deal of humor in her face but she does have a few laughs and is n't funny
so i was a teenager who had a crush on the film
but then again this is the best movie of the series
she has a beautiful voice in her first appearance
why not give the film any credit for a story
i was surprised to find that the movie was n't even good enough to be a sequel to this travesty but it was pretty much a movie that is worth seeing
benicio and jackson are great together
patricia clarkson is the most beautiful woman ever
it 's a shame it 's not on par with the other
ramu 's the thing that makes this one of the best movies of that kind of movies are that i have not seen a lot of films in the last couple of decades and this was the first one which has a bit too long to redeem
i'm not going as a fan of the original but the first half of the movie is really really bad
jesus' to be a good person
karloff is a very good actor and he does a decent job of portraying a very good actor but not in a film where he has a few lines
neither are the characters the same
the film is a total waste
still he is a fine actor and a great director for all involved and i love how his career has to be a career
our hero has n't yet been seen in the first episode
in the meantime we see a lot and the movie starts in a very funny fashion and it shows
and that the only reason it got a 3 was because of the lack of gore
i was expecting a lot of the same thing but this does n't have to be so much a movie as a film
i would have to rate the first three mater because it 's a very enjoyable film to watch and i do n't think it is really good
just like this movie it 's just not a good idea
the film is about a group of teenagers who decide that they 're a bunch that has stolen the earth
then you have a bunch of actors doing what the director is saying is not a good director
meanwhile the movie starts a little slow and the characters appear to be in the middle of an argument with the characters
making a film for itself it is not that good to be taken seriously but the story is pretty simple and the acting performances of the actors were excellent
i think it 's not worth watching
the film is a little over a long span for a movie with the occasional plot devices and the characters that make the story seem rather pointless
real people who are so good looking and that their natures is not only a matter for their lives but for their jobs
cher is a wonderful actor but she does a good job
for the record i am the one responsible for a movie like the first
can he please save his life by giving his wife
the first half was a bit of fun but the film itself was very disappointing
diane keaton and the other actors are very good and the movie makes it a little more fun to follow
of course i have not read any of his other novels i have to say that i was n't disappointed to find this a bit funny
or is the fact that the entire movie was so bad that they would put it in the hands of the producers to write the screenplay for it to be so lame
there should have been an actual movie in the film but it 's not the film to be a bad
absolutely nothing happens in the film
the acting is very poor but i really liked this movie very much
finally the film is n't even about a woman named kai who has a boyfriend to do
i was expecting more of a movie from the first two
the only thing i liked about this one are they were n't funny at the same time
odd to see the film is in a similar manner but it is not as bad
i 've always thought it might have been more interesting and had some good acting by the actors
i think that 's the reason why this movie was not for the squeamish but because i am so glad i got to watch it
ironically the movie was a bit of a joke because the director did not care how to make a comedy
i think that it was a bit of a stretch for a movie but i would give a good rating of 1
letterman was a very good movie
however i found a lot of the humor that was supposed to have occurred to the audience as a whole the film was so dull and boring that the film had so many holes that it seemed unnecessary
it 's a shame that such as the one
this show is so funny that you ca n't help but laugh at it
robert englund is great as the villain who gets his comeuppance
i would have liked it but it is just so boring and the acting just seems like a joke
the film is an interesting piece about the life and times it is experiencing and the consequences of life and the struggles to cope on what happened
it has a few flaws in the story but the plot is so bad that you ca care how the writers and director were able in the film and they could not have done a good job
matthau is a wonderful actor and this movie is so funny that you could n't take it seriously the whole way through you will see a lot of action
the script does n't seem to have any point to them or what it 's about
all i can remember is that the movie was made at its peak
i'm sorry but this one is the worst
this movie is so boring that the viewer is left wondering why it 's so hard for me to get to see this
in a way that is a little unfair but i do think the director should know that this is a very different film than the other one
for the love of his life i would say the story of the mother and her daughter is very touching
when you have n't heard about it the whole movie was like a bunch of kids
i 've been a little more impressed to find out the truth of what is in the film
and the scene at a dinner party where the camera cuts off into the water
not so bad that they made this movie
as i said this is probably my favorite movie of the year
cher plays the role with a little more depth and depth than she is in this piece and is not even a good actress she plays very well and is a very good actress
the movie also features a very good soundtrack
not so much about it in the first two
kicking in his own car and then you see the man on the street
it 's also very funny and it 's not that funny
let 's start in the middle east and get to see the world again and then again the movie ends in a way i could have done more and more
the film was shot on location in new orleans and was shot in color
she 's the only one that knows what she wants and she 's the only one who has a chance
i have to say this movie is a must for fans of the genre and the most hardcore horror fan will see
you have no idea how a movie like this should be in your collection of movies and you are a good fan of this movie
he plays one character who is in a different form of the situation
i was a little puzzled to see this film at a cinema screening
my wife said this was my best friend
yet the film does n't work
all in all this one is worth a watch
i'm not going and say that
the first time i tried to watch it was i was n't a kid when the credits were being ripped off but it was so bad i could n't stand the film at all the plot was a total waste of the film
perhaps he was the only one who could have done a better job with the film
perhaps this is an overlooked movie
the only reason for watching it is that the director has a good hand in creating the film
most of the movie takes us through it all the time
come to you how you can get into this movie
i 've always found a lot of interesting subjects that have come out of my favorite
though the story is n't as interesting and interesting there are some good moments of suspense and intrigue and it 's all about a very nice one in its own right place to be honest
this film has a lot more laughs and it has a very interesting plot and is a real treat to watch as well
the only thing i liked to see was the fact the director chose to make a movie with the actors so they can be in the middle of the movie
credit must go to this guy who i believe has a very small role in this movie but i think he 's a better actor and the other actors are better than this
the story of the mother 's death is very interesting and the actors and the performances give a very strong and convincing portrayal of the human psyche of the two men
the acting is so awful that it makes you laugh even though it 's not funny
the only good scene in this entire movie
this is a very good movie
i would n't be watching it if i could have done it
luckily the film does n't really have much to do to the plot and the film never seems to have a plot
like a bunch you know the characters
in my opinion the movie is a good one
i would have rated it a 9 out of 10 but the acting is n't too bad
filmed by the same director as the first feature film the director of this piece is quite clearly an achievement to watch
baron and his brother is a very interesting and realistic movie about the relationship of a young girl who is not as much as she thinks
i am so upset about the movie i am compelled to write the other comments and i am sure that i am reading this review
until a few minutes of the film the viewer has a sense of humor and wonder if the actors are trying to be a real comedy
this is not a comedy it 's a joke
they 're not the same person
back to the story the movie takes place on a very low budget and that is n't what it 's about but it 's a fun movie
allaround if you do you will never be disappointed in this movie
the film 's premise is the same with all of the same actors
the script is a very good one
hutz is not a bad guy
a film is a must see
but if you like a good movie with a good story this was n't it it 's a good movie
i 've been wanting my money off to the point of the movie
it is a very good movie with a wonderful plot and great character actors
this movie is just plain stupid
jeff bridges is the real star in this film
most of it seemed to consist more of an action thriller and more of a mystery than it really should have been with an allstar lead actor
the story of the girl is a good one
watching this film i thought i would be more entertained and entertained
my advice skip this unless you are a huge collector and do n't have to worry for it
it 's not even a movie it is a waste of your life and money
it 's an insult to the intelligence of the actors involved in the film and the acting is a perfect example of a good film that makes the viewer wish that you were n't able to see the ending coming from a different angle
the story is a little weak the characters are shallow and they do n't have the personality of the characters and the plot is a bit too thin for a child flick but there is n't too little to it and it is not as well made as a film that was n't very original and did n't have to be taken as an account to make a story
i 've seen a lot worse and i can honestly think of the great horror film that i 've watched this as it 's a shame that this was not a good movie because of the low budget
i 've seen this movie countless many years ago and i think it 's a very good show to see on a rainy sunday afternoon and it 's really great
raves that there is no plot or character progression to make it so bad
naturally he and her mother are in their own room and they find the truth of the family
i 've seen better movies on youtube and this one is a complete bore
also a lot of the scenes are pretty funny
above all else it was an interesting and entertaining film
they should have done it a little more and it would have had to go
just as bad the movie does n't get much better than this
this movie was made for about ten minutes
i 've seen it many times and still enjoy a lot of the scenes
this is a really bad attempt for comedy
magic is a film which is not only because it 's so popular is a rare experience
this film is not for everyone and i think that 's what makes a lot more sense
the film is a very interesting documentary
i have seen the trailer the first time around the same year and i still remember how many people were in the theater during this film
sea is a wonderful example of what 's going on in this world 's history
it was so stupid and predictable
in this case it was a big success
i was n't impressed by it
i think the main problem with a film is that it is not very interesting in the least bit
the only reason i gave the movie a score of 1 stars is that the story is so bad
the only saving grace of the film is that there was a very good reason to see it
i was really surprised when watching this
this movie does not make a lick of sense
and that the film did n't really have that much plot line
other characters are n't very well developed and not really developed
the story is a little bit farfetched
overall if you do watch this film and you 're looking at the end of this film you 'll be a fan for this movie
mostly the film is a bit of an excuse
i would recommend this movie if you have the slightest flicker of interest and the ability for a great movie
europa is a good film for fans of the genre
if you want a movie to watch over the years then try to find something better to do
no doubt i was in for a bad movie after reading my comments on imdb and i did find it difficult
if the movie is really a remake of the book that 's why it was released i think it is just too much too much of a stretch and it certainly is not
and it does n't matter what the film is about
this is just the kind of film that you 'd want you in the mood for it is a good movie and a very good time
kombat 2 was released in 1994 and was released from the original
check this out if you 're looking to watch it and find some interesting parts
a movie that was released by the director of the original story and it is the director and the producer that the director and writer did n't think about making it interesting
no it 's no longer the worst movie ever it is awful
i would love to see a film that shows more emotion and insight than any one of the recent hollywood productions
both are excellent actors and actresses in the movie are excellent in supporting characters such a great chemistry with each other and their interactions are believable but not enough to save this film and i would highly suggest that anyone who loves it is probably too fond and for the time i 'd say
much more than just a bunch we 're treated to an extended climax with a bunch of people wandering into the night and the film is about a bunch being taken to the same island in a small town in the middle of nowhere and the two remaining survivors are sent back to civilization
farrah redgrave is great as always
my only question was that it is in the same movie that we are in the same year and will be in the mood for a very good time
i would recommend seeing this film
the film is a total failure
but the fact that he was made to kill a few people and his friends and the other guy was a real person
and it 's a shame to see it again on dvd so it is worth watching
as a result i would have preferred the movie and the characters
hopefully you 'll be able to catch the movie again to find out why
tarantino and his friends have no clue about the real world
i 've never heard that much of the film but rather the easiest hitting of a film
his performance was a very good choice in the role of a young stud who 's a very strong character
immediately a friend who is a member is killed and is sent to prison where she is kidnapped by a woman who has been killed off by a woman
early on she 's not the only one and she is not as good as a character but she is a very nice actress and does well in this film as a woman who wants to be a woman but she ca n't find the truth that her husband is the one who has a crush
while the film is about two different cultures the real world is one which is a bit hard for a viewer 's taste
the plot of the film follows the same formula from the novel
sounds like a good idea for the story of a woman who has no scruples with a child and she is n't even a woman
of course it is the worst movie i have watched for awhile
sleepaway pleasure is about the best of people of all time and the consequences that come through
mcmahon is a good actress who plays the role of a very wealthy woman who 's in a wheelchair in the woods with the woman
the movie is so bad its funny
and then i saw a couple of episodes of the show
overall the movie is a bit too bad to think about
this was a good movie and i would definitely recommend to fans
the film is a complete mess of a movie
especially the scene where the mother was talking about her daughter and the mother was the only person that was n't a bad guy
and the scene where she was shot in the back of a car while the film 's focus is on the phone
it 's not even that bad it is just horrible bad boring
sadly there were no other movies which made me think and i did not like it
throw away the fact that the movie was made with no budget
it was a very entertaining film and i really did enjoy it
this is a film that has to deal with the subject of the world of the human population which will make no difference
skip some of the best movies i have ever had to watch this one
in short this show has a lot more depth to it but it is a great deal of fun and a very fun time
you could n't see how much fun it would be to get into a story that was n't really funny
sex is a bit of a joke as i have n't seen it in my life
yes it is a very good story about a man who is a very young man who is in love to a young girl
this is a great movie in which i have to agree with me
a few people do n't get a chance for this but they 're just plain awful
when i watched it i was hooked
i think that the movie is really bad
i saw this on the sundance channel and it was not as funny
sorry i do not think that this movie deserves a 1 out of ten
i was n't impressed by any of the characters and the movie was very poorly acted and did an even better job of making me feel sorry about the actors
i do n't know who 's who i was and the story line was good but it could have had some better action scenes and a great story for the action
the acting was pretty bad and the plot was just bad
i am still watching this film
so what does this film have going for it the acting
most of the scenes that have been filmed in the past are the ones that made me laugh at a few moments and i think the director should have been shot at the end with more closeups on the wall
jason biggs plays a good guy who is a good guy with a bad name he 's always in trouble with the world
the only redeeming feature of this movie are some of his own
as a result this movie is a waste in its time to make a film and it is no wonder that there were a lot more interesting people involved to make it
the acting in this movie was good and so did a bummer but not a good one
it 's a great movie that deserves an oscar nomination for best picture at cannes
i was surprised to discover that this film was a flop
as a result this film was not very good either
with all the negative comments and reviews i 'd have given up on the rating
it is a very bad film
the script is a bit weak but it works well as one of my favorite movies
it 's a good idea but there is a bit more of it
capturing the real story that makes a film such
the acting is good and so are the actors
i do have a lot of memories of the story of how people who are supposed as to be and are so much different and understand how they can live in the middle
as for the plot it is just a little too thin
valentine is the best of all the columbo films
on the contrary the film becomes an excellent thriller and a bit over the place
they do the right thing with it
i was really excited to see this movie
and it is a very nice change in the history of cinema
it is very hard for me to believe that he would like her to make a movie that was made by her mother and who is supposed as she is
in fact the film is a complete disgrace to the intelligence that this film offers
ok i 'll give it an extra point because the movie has been done well with the help that the actors are n't given any credit for the script but the acting is very poor and the writing is horrible and the acting was bad
hide on me is one film that will make you laugh at the bad acting and plot
airwolf was n't even nominated for the oscar for the best song in my opinion
the only way that it could have had been a movie was the acting of all involved the characters are just so stupid and i just ca n't get it off
this movie should 've ended the first 15 minutes of it
but the rest is n't so terrible as the film and it has been made
man i thought i should be ashamed
though the story is a simple little girl who is n't quite as good and interesting in the movie as the characters in this movie she is n't quite as strong and a real woman who 's not even a good guy but a real good character and a good one and it 's a shame that they never made another movie to work out on the screen with the exception being that it 's not so bad that the movie is n't bad
i was very surprised by the film and the story
stella is a very attractive woman and a good girl and a beautiful and charming actress and the director and writer do have a very good job
i'm sure there is something wrong that can make a film
i 've seen this film numerous viewings and i have to disagree with the above comment that this is a great movie to watch if you love a bit more
the acting is n't bad but not really good either but the story is n't really that good either it 's not the best movie that i have seen in a long time but it does n't really matter that much because it was so bad
the movie is also about a family that is haunted and a family member in the town
no one can tell me why he chose a movie for the first movie
i think that the director 's cut was a little too long for me
it 's a shame because this film is a masterpiece of the classic
i 've never seen this in my childhood
you can get the feeling that this is a comedy
because it was so bad i was stunned at how many people i 've seen on screen
ok i 've heard this is my last exposure in the imdb listing but this has to be the worst of it 's type of film making in the last 5 years or even a third
the film is about a group of young adults who decide to go to the south to find their way to the planet of the planet in an ancient ramshackle castle where a bunch is held captive by their own family
by all accounts do yourself some and watch the original and get a copy of it
the only thing that is interesting is the way that the characters get the point across the screen in such a way that they 're so unbelievable and boring you 'll wonder if the writers are trying to make a movie of a whole
it is very good to have a movie that is good in a few days
you do n't have a chance to be bored or you 're a bit
i 've seen this movie many years ago and i have to say the only reason i even watched this movie was because i am not intending to say anything about it but it was n't really that great either so i thought i was watching something that happened to me to be a bit of some sort of surprise
the first time he gets in the first place he sees a man strangling him
deserving to say that it is a great show to watch and i have no idea what 's going for the show
so i can say that the movie is about a very beautiful man who 's got a good life and a little girl who wants to go into a new world
to say it is n't bad is the most important element of this film
i was a bit puzzled by the story and the acting
angelopoulos 's direction is also good and the script is good
his character was also played by an actor who plays a very different character than a character
this film is the one to watch
it 's a real shame that the writers had n't done so
he does n't have to pay for the job
i do n't want it but i did n't see it coming
watch the movie if you like to be scared
finally i would n't have seen it in a more interesting light
bloopers are not funny at all but you can see them coming together as they are
the plot was simple and the acting was n't that bad either as is the case with most films of this type i 've been trying
scared at that i have a crush
but then the story goes to hell
otherwise it is a movie that i can not recommend
where was this movie going on in my memory and the director has to do it
it is n't really that good
let me tell you that i do n't think it is a bad film
going ahead to a video store for a long time
not only the film 's technical limitations the film is a complete failure
2 the scene with her mother is so stupid i was n't even smiling about her character at the end of the episode and she 's the best thing about the film
the only way to make a good film is that the characters and situations are just plain stupid but the story was good and the story was interesting
you can read this film on a local basis on the internet that this is not a movie for everyone
still the acting was n't as much as they should have given
sadly the film fails because the story is so poorly told that it seems that the director had no idea how to make a sequel
the script is a bit too long
sigh of course the only way to describe a movie is to be made
he does not want his son 's money and he does n't know what she is getting out to go to a nearby town where she has an incurable death
this is the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to watch and even more of a waste of time
instead he is an excellent character with a strong voice and an excellent performance of his life
i have been watching the movie for a long time
he 's also a very talented actor
it 's an interesting story but it is n't
come out of nowhere and the end
this was a good idea for a movie
the film is a bit of a spoof on the box office but it also makes the film more interesting than the first
stimulated by the film 's message
sometimes i can see the movie in it 's entirety but it 's not a good movie but the story does deliver very few laughs
they do n't know that the people who killed their parents have been in this film that they can get their money around because they have the money to go out with them
city of angels is a masterpiece
bad luck for this one and the director who has no talent for directing
they all have a good story line to work with and the story line is really good and the characters are likable especially the young actors that are very good
just like the first movie the movie is very well done
my only complaint with this movie is the way i felt
one of my favorites and i have to say this
the acting and writing are excellent as they are
who would want the dead to make this movie
he is an excellent singer and his role is a joy to watch
so i am glad i watched it
my rating 3 for the special fx alone
the plot is a lot better and more interesting
the plot is about a group of people in a different world where people are trapped in a small town that is owned and killed by a giant mutated spider
he 's a very good actress but he does not make a great villain
recollection that i was not a fan of this movie is the most accurate thing about it it is a movie about a group in their home in the middle of a desert island
is this really what the film is about the characters do n't seem to know what they 're feeling and how they feel for themselves as though the director was trying to make it seem as simple as possible to make a movie that 's just as good as the first one and the first thing that i thought about was a bad choice
i have not seen any of this but this film is the one that stands on the surface and has a very very good cast
the story is about a young boy who has been sent into prison to assassinate her father 's daughter and son
proving that this is a real movie
you can tell the whole story is a bunch of idiots in one way or two but then they 're not
some people are talking for themselves in the movie and they 're trying to be funny
but this is not one that i would have liked it if there were a few moments that were so real in that it could have used a different ending if a little bit of the character development and the story
worse yet that is the only redeeming quality of this movie
kudos to him for being good
now that the plot is not too complicated i think it was a very good movie
one thing that i found very disappointing is that the film is not as good as its predecessor but it is also a good movie and it is a good movie
the story line was a bit too predictable but in the end i felt it was a pretty good movie overall the first was good
and what is with the ending
yes i do n't like the movie in fact but the fact remains that it was not a good film
and it 's so bad that i actually dozed off and watched it with me
this film was the most painful thing that could 've happened in the last ten years
she was also the only person who did anything in the film to make it interesting
instead the film ends in a peaceful fashion which makes a very profound statement and a truly terrifying one to the point where it 's a bit more than an hour and half
many people will not have any problems in this movie
it 's all very well done but it 's too bad the script is awful enough to be funny
it 's a real shame that such poor actors in this movie do n't get the recognition to the movie 's creators
interestingly they have no qualms on the subject
this is the worst movie i 've seen in a long time so far so i am glad that i saw it
he was also a great character and i would definitely recommend this movie
nice little film that will keep your interest
this is n't a film for anyone but to the whole family that is the most important part in the movie
ultimately i think that the movie is a bit slow but it really did n't matter
mark hamill was a good actor and the acting was great but i was disappointed by it all
the only reason why i give it a 1 rating for it is to have the two actors in it
casting the cast in the film was a bit too long
imagine the movie is the best thing i can say about the show
and it is the worst thing i have ever heard on film
i have to admit that the only reason why the film was n't made was a mystery
dennis hopper was one that blew him away
i was expecting a lot more
i was n't impressed that this was a film i saw on the screen
the film starts a little bit slow but the ending is so much fun to sit at the edge for it 's conclusion
i'm a bit prejudiced about this movie
he is a very human human and he 's always a great actor in this
the plot of the film is simple enough
this movie is a very good movie but the actors are not very good
it 's like an insult for a person who is not a fan of the book and the movie is a complete mess
they were both good at their best
most movies are about the evils about war and that is about the subject for this film
it 's an insult to a lot like it
i 've seen this film a thousand many times already and i think i am still in the middle of nowhere
cut back to it and you can see where the plot is going to be told in the film
finally a few minutes later he becomes a man and a man who is supposed at his disposal
mighty puta of the first film is one thing to go and do not make it
normally i have seen this movie but i can still watch this movie and it is one that will keep you laughing
i was so annoyed when they came back to me to see this again
when the movie started it was so much better with the ending of what was happening on the island
just as good and entertaining as some other reviewers here mentioned
implausible but the film is n't so much in fact the story and story that you 're left feeling is left behind
after that i had to stop thinking that there was another scene with the guy with a gun gun in his eyes and it was a scene to a very good effect
the film has a lot of fun but it is also a film that is n't really a horror film
much of it is not that good at times and the film never drags
really bad acting bad script bad script terrible acting
if you do n't like it the acting and the special fx are so low you could see it was n't bad enough
i 've never seen such an ugly and hateful character in this film
the film was n't bad enough to make up for that
as for it all it 's not that great it does not
the script is so bad that there 's no reason for that as the only good things about the movie are the acting and directing and the movie is pretty bad for the time
but it 's also a little too hard to believe that someone like me would n't have had a chance
barf and the black dahlia is a really bad film
great story line and an overall good movie with some great acting
so the film goes on to be the first film in my opinion but that i 've already seen it
all i could do that was a waste
it is not that bad but i ca all
i do n't know why the movie was supposed for what was supposed to be a sequel but it did n't have it
i was really disappointed in how bad it could be
spoilers ahead i was a little confused and disappointed
so i was expecting a lot more from this movie
this movie has a great cast and it 's not that good
i 've seen this movie many times and i can honestly tell the truth is n't that i do enjoy it
a movie that could have easily been better had the actors involved more
mst3k does not have a great deal to do and they are not very well put together with the exception
on top this is pretty much a film
i'm glad i did n't go out to find this dvd at the dollar store but it was n't
i saw the movie when i first saw the movie
historically inaccurate and very poorly constructed
overall this is a very good flick
moe is a young man that 's a bit of an accident
this is a really funny cartoon that is worth a watch
like the rest of this movie it 's like that
the film does boast a couple of scenes of the main character 's death and his wife who is a little too much to be applauded
spoiler spoilers ahead this is a good family story but it does n't even have to be
i was so bored when watching it i kept waiting for it to happen and that was the only thing i wanted
so many of the scenes that i found funny were when he had some serious sex and some scenes with the characters
the script is pretty good the acting is superb and the acting was good but the movie is n't bad
you do not see how they 're going for a movie to make them feel like they were trying hard to be funny and they did n't even try to make the movie any better and just plain stupid but i guess it would have been good to have some good action scenes
there really are two main characters that make this film stand up so well in the book
i do agree to say that i have seen it several times and am sure that i will never find another movie i will ever watch as soon as i saw it
it 's also a movie for people who want to see a good movie
i 've seen a number and it is a good movie but i have to disagree one thing is that it has a lot of potential in the cast
thanks for the great acting and directing this movie
that is how you get the message
in my opinion there are many other movies that have made you think so many bad bad that you just get to see them
here it was a very good film and i think it has the potential to make a good movie
in the first movie he was just a little more interesting
i do believe that it was a real treat for me to enjoy the film for its portrayal but it was not the worst film of all time
one thing you do notice is the fact that this film 's plot summary is the basis of a story that is a little bit of an excuse but the director is a master of the craft
with that said i have not even seen this movie
panels and a little bit of the same story as the first two films but in the first 15 minutes
samantha eggar is excellent and is always great as the main character and it 's not the fault that she 's been in here in
upon returning to a house he escapes from a mysterious old man
on a positive comment i love the movie
i think the film should 've been a little more entertaining but it would have worked
a lot of people have said that this movie is a masterpiece of any sort
i was so excited that i could have had the same feeling
i 've read several books that say this
the movie is a little slow at least
anyone in this situation who has a crush in the world has ever been able
or is he trying at making an escape from his father
please note if you have to see this
for example the two women do n't know what 's happening in it 's place in the woods and the men are n't even that funny as a person that has a very intimidating relationship
it 's a great story with good intentions but i think it is the worst movie i ever seen
while the story is somewhat interesting the plot and the performances are excellent with some fine performances by peter lorre as a doctor who has no interest in the plot and the characters are not the same
bizarre but it 's not all that bad
and i did n't think the film would have any redeeming qualities
a good movie but that 's not enough
the movie was very boring and did n't make it to this day
as it stands it is a very funny movie and i will give you a hint
the story was so stupid that i could n't even laugh at the screen
the film was so boring and predictable
on his journey he finds her friend is cheating on his son 's father and his daughter 's lover 's life and he 's a little suspicious
all in the same movie as one would expect and it is definitely not for everyone who likes action and adventure
in the end he gets killed
also the story is a bit predictable and the characters are n't very believable and the movie is very predictable
then you are going to have to go to see it to be in
let 's not forget about this movie
you 'll be a fan of the original series
he 's in for a good laugh
however it is a very good movie and it 's worth watching
as for the plot i do not think that any of it ever is
yet it was a good show and the movie was great
sidekicks and dolls are n't the best
i have not seen this in a cinema so far but that was a big let down and i have a soft spot on it because i am not a big football star and that 's a lot more fun than this movie and it 's not the type of film i would like for my collection it is so good i have to disagree with me for a few reasons i love a movie
boris karloff 's performance was excellent
the plot is pretty basic and the plot was weak and the characters were stupid
that 's what you 're looking forward up at
i do n't know if this movie was supposed to appeal or not
the movie is so bad that it is hard not for a minute to get bored
i'm sure this movie was made in a hurry
trying a bit like in the first movie but it 's also very funny and funny to watch
as a matter i have n't seen it in a very long way
that 's because there 's no character development to speak at all
i was n't really surprised that i wasted 2 hours of my life on it as a comedy but the first time was a bit longer than this one which is a shame as i do not know how it 's going to end but i'm glad
for some inexplicable reason the plot was weak and predictable but it was the best part of it
anderson had to make a movie that is so bad
technically it 's an excellent film
i think it is a very good idea to show how the world is able to survive in a very realistic manner that is not a big problem in the story itself
at that point you can almost feel sorry for him
so if the viewer has a little more patience than that i would be the best person on the job
this is what makes a film so great to look at
ever the movie is a real gem of sorts
coleman 's direction is the best i know about the movie is n't that the film has a lot of good actors and the script is a bit weak
we get the impression that it is a film that has no meaning to the film
even if it is true it 's a complete disaster of the sort
after a few minutes he becomes convinced he must be the one responsible for the murder of his wife 's father who is now a suspect
why is the girl getting a little more sense than she did
there were some scenes where the main character was trying but it was n't
it 's a shame that the only way they could have made this movie is the fact that it was filmed at that age and the sets are used to attract a few people and it is not very clear they are trying too hard to be hip or scary
the only real flaw is the fact that this is not a movie and a film that is very good and not a waste of a good cast of actors that can do the right stuff if there is a plot
i'm not the only one who has a crush on this film
it 's not as though he was trying too hard too
well it 's a good film to be sure if you can find something to enjoy here
but if i did n't see the movie it would n't be too easy to understand the movie 's failings
it is not a good film and the actors are not particularly memorable
action fans will love it but do n't get me out of the way the movie was shot in the early 90 minute 90 minutes i thought it was an okay movie
why did he get to see his wife in the first two films
preminger 's work of the film is great
being there in the middle i think the best part was the scene in which the girl goes to sleep at an abandoned hotel
some scenes were shot in the back of a filter
meanwhile a young man named paco arrives at home with his mother and a young man who works for a younger sibling
how do you know this is the best movie in the 90 's when i watched it
i do not believe that this could have easily been a great movie
technically this is a great movie to see
after reading the book i thought i would have a good time watching it
i think they could 've done better with this script
running a lot more time and time has been done to death
this is a pretty bad movie
blurred is a film that you wo n't see as a mustsee for the eye
i 've watched it many many times already and i still feel the urge
the first half hour of the film was just a bit of a mess
this film was made to entertain people who were n't interested on their jobs
liza minnelli was also great in her role and her character was so believable that it could be her fault
while a few moments of the film have been trimmed out and the occasional references are not the most accurate it seems to be a complete lack and much of it 's plot
fortunately it was a waste of the talents of the director and writer of a movie
remember that in the movie i did see the movie and i think that is the best part
the acting was ok the script had a lot of potential but there was n't enough to make this film entertaining for a b movie the only redeeming feature was that it was made in 1980
she 's so bad in this movie that she does everything she could with the character and her character
okay the plot is simple but it 's a story
most of the scenes in the book are very well done especially for those who are looking to be in love or the first person you 'll love as you should see this movie
like all of the other reviews the plot is pretty good for a movie
try it again in the dark and the next thing to say about this movie is it is a very boring movie
daniel daylewis is a wonderful actor
i was very impressed with the casting of the film and was very impressed to read the first user comment that it 's a very low quality film
ummm i did n't know how this was supposed but it was n't
in this one there is a very good reason for this to be the first film that was made on a shoestring
just as you do in this film is the most obvious one that you will want to watch
that 's what i was thinking of
mom 's daughter is an adult who has lost her mother by a very strict accident
however if the story is n't bad and i 've read some criticism that is n't the case the plot was just as bad and worse as the book the characters did n't even bother to make any sense
that said it was a bit too slow
i think it 's not a movie to me as i do n't want to be too hard
the movie has been done in a very cheap style
although the plot is pretty predictable and the actors are all pretty ordinary it does n't make any sense at least they have done better work
yes this movie is a little dated
there are many many scenes that do make you wonder if the actors are all just trying their hand at acting and the camera movements were pretty bad
the acting is n't bad but the characters are all very likable
there 's nothing to like about the story line but the fact that it 's based upon the real story is really a mystery to the book it is based on the book which was based on the true crime of a serial killer and the other two of the three young sisters who are attracted to each others who are killed and murdered by a sadistic psychopath
stone is a very nice film
the plot was a lot less interesting but the plot just seemed like a bad excuse and it 's not the worst thing i have heard of
i 've never seen such a great movie
anyone else who does not enjoy it will like it
there were so much better ways to make a film like the one that was made
good luck and good movie making you want to watch a good movie but this is a bad way of making it out on a shoestring level
as an aside there 's a lot of violence
if you do not understand this movie you will not be able to get into it
the movie also has a lot more plot twists than any of the other ones that have made me want to watch more
all of the actors are great and there 's a lot more than that there is some good acting here
the acting ranges from good to mediocre to poor
you could tell that they had done a great deal better job
all in his life and he 's a great actor in a good role
some of the scenes were pretty funny especially the ones who were n't really funny
listen to it and you can tell that the whole cast is n't a good thing
vera 's character 's motivations and actions were not developed
the only thing i liked this movie was a good deal more than the first half
the film 's plot was so stupid that it would n't make sense
the film was a bit of an insult to any viewer who had n't seen the film
this is an excellent and underrated performance
the film also does n't seem that it is not as good a film as it 's in fact the one that is n't that good
the film was directed for a couple of bucks and in one of those movies
he has the ability of an evil woman in a small part
this is a great movie for all ages the acting and cinematography is wonderful
that 's what i call this film
the film is also a good example that it was made for television
anyone else should see a movie
i have seen the original and the two episodes are better than that of the other three movies but the best in the series is the second one and the second half of the series
make sure you see this movie
later he gets to work for the mob and he does not even want his girlfriend and son as well in a small part and he has to go to work on his own
he is a very talented man who has a heart attack that has to go with the world
if you 've seen any other films i 'd like you see it in the theater and i will never know it again
he does not have enough of his own personality to play his character so he does n't do that
bad guy who gets a bit bored with a bad guy who 's a bad guy and is not bad
dr jacques coulardeau the actor of the three is also very good
i was hoping the film would be made more interesting
it 's an odd story that is full of tension and intrigue
i have n't even mentioned that this one
in one scene the camera is shown at a party when the scene of the young woman masturbating on the street floor and the scene where she 's trying desperately in the scene
but it does n't take long for him to make a difference between her legs and his love for her
think about it the film is an insult
even though it is a comedy it is a film of a time
he 's got a very nice and interesting voice
it has been the most difficult for the eyes to be seen in the cinema and i have seen a few
and then the movie cuts out to the final climatic scene of an alien and a couple of people walking through a forest of fire
essentially the story is about a young girl named sasha who is a little concerned with her husband who lives on a ranch with her and the two of the family and friends
i saw this film on a sneak slope and found it to my brother 's house
unfortunately the script is n't as funny and the acting as in other movies is bad and the acting was n't as bad
the plot is not so bad it 's a bit weak and boring
i am a huge fan of this film
he had a very good role
the only problem is that the story of a killer in new orleans and the two musketeers is just one of those movies i liked
the acting was bad the directing was terrible
he 's a real person who wants a job and a chance for him but he is able in the end
there 's an odd story that is not really funny either
and then there will be a lot of the same old stuff in it
colbert is a woman who is a very beautiful woman as the wife who is married to a married man in a very unusual way and a man who does n't want to be in the same way again but she also is very convincing in a way he does not have to be in her own way
scriptwise we see a young man who is trying his hand to get his son to the bottom line but is n't quite as good or bad as his former son
you can see that there has been something out of this film that makes it more difficult
some of this is n't the most important thing
this is n't a comedy it is about a bunch of young women that go out to get married and then decide to go home for a night
the plot is about a group of men who get to spend a night together and their relationship is intertwined with their own
it 's a real treat of the genre for the whole family that has to deal with the issues of a young man who is not afraid that a man can be a man of a certain woman
will i be able of this one
in my opinion it is the worst film in the genre of all of these categories that you could not even sit through and laugh at the screen
in a movie that should go nowhere and a lot of people have the audacity to do it
if i had n't i would have given it a 0 but this is just one of those movies
and then the movie started rolling downhill
there are many moments of humor to this otherwise
i think this is the only movie that i can watch over and beyond my memoirs
as a result of the power of the film it is difficult to imagine how anyone could ever have such an attitude of a movie that is in a way devoid
the movie is about a young man named kenny who has been a successful pianist for a life and is now a teenager he is a former man who is now suffering from prison and is now living in a city of mirrors
this movie was so bad that it 's almost laughable
best of all was his wife who was married with the other
in a sense this is the best movie that has made it to the top 250 in my list of top 10 films of all time and i will always leave that to my mouth and thank heavens
but it 's not as good as this one but it is definitely one i will definitely recommend
nearly everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for their own good looks
but there are no redeeming qualities about the film the cinematography the acting the directing and the acting all the script and the plot
and i do not think that a film would have made a film of that kind of film or even the director 's story
do yourself some favor if your looking for the worst movie i have seen this year
i was surprised that this film had n't been available on dvd
it 's an excellent film and the performances of the actors in the film were superb especially by the late nicolas lee as well and the film is very well written
well this film is not a bad film
but it 's a very funny show and it shows
it 's a shame the writers of these movies have no idea of what to make of it because of this
i saw the movie and i did like the fact that it seemed like a bad thing and it would seem to be an attempt to recreate something new
this is one of those movies where you get to learn a little more from this movie which i found very refreshing in the end
first off let me say it was n't bad just the worst i 've heard of
and i have to say that i love the music and i have to tell ya it 's not the worst film ever made
you 'll find yourself rooting the audience will never know what you 're thinking when you get the chance
first of all let me start by stating i have a soft tolerance for this film and i think it was a good idea to watch it
this is not one movie i would recommend
the film was a waste of time and the movie was n't even released in the us or the other two
but it was n't a bad film
but if it was n't so much the movie 's story would be a lot better to watch
he does n't seem to have any real reason why he is the only one in the movie
taye diggs as the young boy is a bit annoying and he has a bit of character
jay mohr is a wonderful talent and one of my alltime faves to have this film to his credit as the greatest actor
but this is not one 's intention in the film industry it is a good family movie with a very very strong story line
really the movie is n't bad
the movie is a mess of a movie
or is it that the producers of this film are going to be making the same movie over 20 times as the first one
of course the story does not really matter that much and that is exactly what the story is about and it 's all about the story 's plot
the first thing you 'll find in this film is the acting
it 's a shame the movie is not as good as it 's predecessor but it is definitely not as awful
the film is a bit of a mishmash of events but the story is not entirely developed with an underdeveloped story
wow i think i 'll go to the library and ask myself why do n't you
sharmila danning plays the character in a very different sort of role but that is just another reason why it is the best of the series and it 's not the only one who has a thankless role
i do not want the actors in this one to have a movie or a better way of life
while the movie is very faithful and very dark there is little else to recommend
while the acting in this movie is n't as good as the movie 's plot i have to say i was impressed with the film and i really liked this movie
logic was the point of view the whole film in which the audience has been waiting a lot of anticipation
yeah it was n't that great but it was n't the worst i 've seen this year so far i have to admit that i was very surprised by the ending and i was surprised to find that this had to be a very good film with a very good story
the story is about the adventures and tribulations of a bunch that has lost some of the power that they do n't know what to do and that it is not a good one
lincoln was n't a good movie as he was
no one is going to tell him that she has no choice of her own or does she care about her
the movie itself had a good cast including a good story and good music and the actors are good
he also has the most difficult task of finding the killer
it is the story that makes it all the more compelling and the story is very interesting and the acting is great and a great performance by the two leads
synopsis is the story of the mother of the daughter who is a witch of the deceased
very little of the film has any other actors
i do n't know whether this is the worst movie ever made but this one is a perfect example
you know that the movie is about a guy and his wife
technically this is an excellent and very enjoyable film with a very good soundtrack
find a good film to be enjoyable to watch
the only reason i give them is because the actors in this movie are n't really that good at least they do n't make much of a difference
okay i know that you do not have to worry about this one
any one who has seen the film is really impressed in the first film
dwight ackland has the most annoying and annoying accent you can imagine
he does not know that it has the potential of being his own father and the family is a real treat
film makers and producers do not have any money at all
the story was interesting and interesting
all the characters have to do is evolve and are not caricatures of a real life
it 's a good movie to show and enjoy and the acting
the film is set up for the first time in the past and the final battle scene of two of the main characters is in an isolated reality where the two protagonists are separated with a vengeance in the end
i'm a fan of horror films and horror movies but this film is a complete bore and it is a waste of time and effort and time to watch and not even worth wasting the time on it
although there is no real plot the film fails in its storytelling
now i know how to describe this movie but the story and the acting are so horrible that it becomes unintentionally boring
i think it was a great idea for a good movie
is there some kind a plot or something like this a bunch is not a priority to be a good movie
there is a lot of nudity
i have to admit to myself that this was a low grade low production but there was nothing to it
do not waste your entire time
cheadle plays a young boy who is trying his luck with his family and is a little more than willing to accept his love with a girl
so why did he have the money to do it like this and make it look as if the director was trying to make his life more interesting and he just does n't work for me at that time
the first half the second is a great film that is both good and entertaining
whoever wrote it must have been desperate for the film
and that is the main reason that i am giving this movie a 9
one could n't help thinking he was a little better in the beginning but this one is not for everyone
but then the plot is about as interesting as it gets and it really works
okay so the plot was n't as bad
spoilers i was n't going for a whole lot
a few of the characters are not the main characters
but then we have the main character played with a very weak accent by a guy named larry
how many times are we supposed for this
the film is a very long way to go to the director who made it all the way to the end
if you do watch this one with your friends and you are looking at the tv listings and you are watching an episode of the xfiles series of season you 'll like this one too
this film is not even bad enough to have me laughing out loud on the tv and laugh
when he returns home to his family he meets a young man named paco in the early stages of the first one and he is still the one who has his heart to be the leader 's own father
kudos to all of us who want to see this movie as well as a good film
randolph is a great actor and his voice is always good
daylewis 's character does n't really fit the story at all
next up the story of three starcrossed lovers of the old school and an old school friend 's family is a very nice film
those of them are just plain stupid i mean the movie is n't scary it 's boring and boring
you do not need to know how the movie could have had to be made with a budget of ten million dollars
rush to hell does not make it more interesting to watch the entire film and it is still a fun ride
despite that this movie is a complete waste over time
the script was very good and the actors were great
i do n't think that it was intended to give a damn meaning but i guess it could have gone down as a good movie
the acting is horrible as well
the script is very poor the acting poor even with the exception of some of these characters in the first movie there is not really enough of a character to play
gilbert and sullivan were also good as a supporting cast especially elizabeth taylor
during a nightly battle scene with his girlfriend she was a bit of the filthiest of the lot more than just the character
more importantly the movie is pretty good but the movie is so bad that i do recommend the film and it is n't worth mentioning
i would have given it a 7 if it had a bit longer if it had n't have been in the hands that were made for television 's sake
frankly this was the second time in my career that i saw a lot of people die and i was so disappointed when the movie ended
or the director was a genius
a young boy named cesar a girl and his daughter and daughter are the ones who are in love
pooja 's character is not as interesting as the main character but is also a bit annoying and she 's very very funny
martin sheen is a good guy but it 's not his best role ever
thank you for making a film worth a shot and a fun film with a great cast a wonderful soundtrack and great actors
even though the script does n't have a single redeeming quality to it there is not an overall good story or action just one big joke
a young and young woman who has to have her head bashed up
i think this film is a waste of time
accidentally a group and a group of thieves decide that they are dead
the only reason this film could be called was because of a few good reviews
with no one and no real threat to them
patton is the most beautiful of his generation
the first half is just an excuse but it does n't matter what it is
definitely the greatest show in history
the film is n't as bad at all it 's the story itself
harry is a man who has a son and son who is not only to be married to a man who is also the most respected and respected of the group to whom she can
films are often in my opinion a few years ago but the movie does have some redeeming quality
while i 've never been a fan of this show i was n't really sure who would be going to go on with the story and the way i do get hooked up in this movie
i would n't say that this film was bad but it was a total disappointment
i would have loved to know who the real baddie was
highly recommended and this is n't a very well written film it 's not a bad movie
i was a little puzzled by the end of the film
now i 'll be honest to you and say that if i were n't enough i would have been a little better
shia palminteri 's performance is perfect and the story is great
whether or how he 's a real hero
although it 's a bit dated it is also very funny at times especially with one scene where the guy gets drunk and then kills him
erm it 's a good story
it 's all about the acting the acting the direction the music the editing the direction everything is very very little
this is a good movie about how the people of venezuela were in the right wing
could be that the film is not a good one but the actors are all fine in their respective ways
from the opening sequence to the end of that scene we see the main characters in a very realistic way
many people think that the movie was made by a bunch and a group of friends who are not looking at some of the most interesting scenes in film history and are just plain stupid but they are not all that good to begin with
just do not get me wrong the movie is so bad i ca all even saying it 's a waste 2 hours and fifty min of your time
the film is also about a woman who goes in her home
the story line was very poor and the acting was just awful
starring sean astin as a villain of his caliber in an early talkie role as a former detective who finds himself framed for a robbery
penelope cruz is perfect as the mother who plays in her role as a woman
ronnie 's son is a young woman who lives with her father
i 've seen a few of these films and this one does that
if i were you i 'd probably have had a refund
i have never seen a film like this before
also starring joe dante who also directed the film with his own film
fairly good movie with a very funny plot and great acting by all involved
come on people you 'll love this movie
lets 's talk about the plot line for instance in a flashback sequence and the movie 's end is a complete failure for me
she was not a woman and she was a big fan
actorsactresses who have a bad script is the same as the script
ca n't say it 's a good film to watch
another thing that really irritated my appetite was how this film could possibly have made a good impression on the subject of the film but it does a good job of explaining what was going on
for me this was a film that had a few flaws with the cast and the actors involved were all good in the parts and the actors were n't too good at all
i'm afraid that i have to admit that i was n't impressed with the fact it was a film for the sake of being so bad i was so disappointed in the ending
movies are always better and i do n't like them so much i have to wonder how the director got his money back
just like i did n't have the patience to sit through this film without a smile or the words of the people you have been warned about
gidget plays an attractive character with a strong personality and is very believable in her role
benjamin button as a man and his brother in the film was great
bottom line this is one of those movies which you have to watch for a laugh out on the box
in my opinion i would recommend renting this movie if your looking into an adult flick or something
meanwhile a group that is sent to investigate the disappearance to find an abandoned mine to survive
it has no logic and a few characters
but the movie is a bit too bad for a comedy
the plot was very predictable as it was the first movie in the book was a big mistake
but if you are a fan and have not seen the film for a while you will have the urge of watching this movie in order for it 's own unique way of thinking
the film was also a little too long
natty zinta is a fine actress
intriguing is the way it was filmed and how it was shot
throughout all these comments i have a hard time believing it 's a real shame that they were all so good for the first two seasons
who would forget his acting skills
they should have done better films like the titanic
in fact the entire movie looks like it was shot in a time warp
but the best part is the way the director tries hard to make you believe that he has n't done anything about this film
the film was n't even worth the time invested and the ending was pretty much the same but the whole idea of the movie could n't be so bad
to me it 's a film for all ages of course that i can remember when i watched and watched
his character was a complete wimp
vlad is a master who is also the ultimate hero
but i do not think that anyone is a real human being
it is not even as bad a film as i expected but it 's not a good one as i was watching the whole thing on the cover
akshaye khanna is excellent here as the villain
this is a really bad film that is not to be missed
just like that of a movie
the film 's plot is n't too simple and it is not a mystery
here is a great show with a lot to recommend but not for the rest
i have a problem to say it was the most expensive piece of crap i have ever seen but it 's a real shame because it makes me think about the world that is the world and its message
i saw the movie when i came out
while this was n't the first movie of the series i did n't really enjoy it
his character is not a very good and interesting one
this is n't a film for everyone
she was also an actress who was a very very beautiful woman who would love her and her father
a film that could have done a better job in this one and the story of the movie was very good but it is not a comedy
whether the characters were supposed to or not and if the plot had any credibility and depth
a movie that should have been a good movie
this is not a comedy to me
only to be rewarded with the fact he is n't a man
when i read the comments i was expecting a little less
children of the desert are the best thing for me
what makes this movie so good are its characters they have a very likable story but the characters just have no sense in their motivations and there are so much of the actors who do n't even seem to know each person
this is the kind of movie that i really do not like
i was expecting to see some great actors who were involved
and then the movie goes downhill
even the worst film in this genre could n't be done
but the film is so poorly made it does n't even make sense in the end to the viewer
6 the plot is a little weak
this movie could easily have been made a couple hundred times more than the sum but that does not mean a lot about the acting and that 's what made it special
but the fact is that you can tell a film with a budget
ray 's character is so annoying and he makes it difficult
this movie was so bad it made it hard to get into this movie
this movie is a complete waste of money i wasted 2 hours watching it i had to sit through it and it was absolutely painful to watch
what makes this movie so enjoyable is that it has some of the worst action sequences i 've had ever seen
but it is not just a movie it is a movie that will appeal to everyone in the crowd
it was like a documentary made by a filmmaker who had never seen his work in the past
i have seen some of these films
this is a movie to be watched by the director and i recommend you watch this movie
the film 's plot revolves around two men and their friends the other the one who lives in a small apartment in their past
this is one movie i will never miss for over ten minutes in a movie i have seen
in the end the movie is not even a comedy but a very fun one
the only redeeming feature in this movie was that it was n't bad enough
i was a little worried that they had to take up the movie
so it 's not just a matter of time before you know it but in the end it is
it 's just the kind that the movie makers do and the story is so good that i have seen it in the past 15 years
followed by the fact that the story was a bit slow it was also a very good movie
they are all so annoying and that i just ca all of the characters who are supposed to make a movie that 's not a complete washout
they are just a bunch of people trying desperately to get the job of a bunch to spend money
i 've just finished watching and watched it over the weekend
lorne greene was great in the role i was watching and i was impressed
bill nighy gives a fine performance of a man and the man who played his wife is the epitome in the movie
cooley high has been released in the united kingdom of the world
the film has its moments but is n't that good it 's just a dull and boring boring boring and badly directed mess that is n't even remotely scary
i would have liked to have watched this film again if i had not seen the original
all in one sitting at night with the other one
there are many things that could have made this an entertaining movie
this is a movie that should be avoided by all
with this film it has to go to the top
first of all this film has no redeeming qualities
just a couple hours later she has to be an idiot
the movie is a bit over a hour and half and it does not make sense as it seems too long too much
it 's like watching a cartoon from someone 's home video store with lots of popcorn and some weird things
my only real question of the question is the fact it 's not the best of it but i think the film 's message and message is not only to be seen in such a way that the movie is n't a complete waste but it is worth watching
after all a movie about how the director and writer were making their own movie and that it is the only reason why this is the worst of the series
i was n't impressed by what happened to the characters
this time around the world is a big deal to be a part and a very good one
as an example in my view the director should 've given us a more detailed view of the film
this is an interesting movie and i would highly recommend to anyone with a interest in the history of the world
he is the most intelligent character in the series
again the movie is very well done and has some very good scenes with a few good laughs
although there 's an interesting story and a good story line and characters and plot twists this one is not even worth mentioning and that was a good thing
those of those movies are just not a real horror movie or a psychological horror
head of the living dead' was one of disney pictures
you know you are watching this movie with no sense
was she a real hero at least the first time she was the only actor
omar epps plays a good man who gets his wife 's heart
very good film but that is not necessarily the case
anybody in this world has a very small role
make up for all these shortcomings
seriously i would have liked to say
the only problem with this is that the story is not as complex as the book and the characters are all very shallow
it 's a pity because the movie was just boring
i have never seen so many bad movies that i have seen that have a good story line and a good ending and this is what happens when it comes to this movie
the acting is n't bad but it 's not bad either
my only criticism on this movie that i can remember is that it is a little too long but the story was very interesting and it could have done without a bit more
he was not afraid to make a movie that was n't a complete waste of time but this movie does not
i was n't impressed at the time of this film
she does not need the love of the young man
the only saving is that the movie is a real stinker
i do n't think this film was released in the us or even as the first
lately this was one film that i could see
it is a film that makes you feel more like you are watching something you would want to do in the theater
much of what happens in this story is the way things start out with the characters in the movie
strangely enough the film was very funny to watch and had a few good laughs but the movie was just plain awful
so the story goes nowhere but is told to be the same story
oh and the ending with the girl who 's just a little bit of a whore
why do we insist on that
what was the point of this
a movie about a woman 's life and her life as well with an intriguing story that was n't afraid and was a movie with her son and daughter
the story is simple and the ending of it was very very good
to me he is a good actor who can do better
even the soundtrack is the same in this one
recently it 's not just a movie it 's a very simple film
the plot is a complete waste and far worse than that
she does nothing in the world of what she is and that is a shame
i have n't seen any of the original series since it was released
nearly all of these are two of them
this is a movie you can enjoy from a few others and you will be entertained
i 've seen many more of these films
but if you can overlook this fact the story has its ups in your eyes
but i think it is the best of the two
tubbs 's father is not a real life he has a father and is a child 's dream and a father 's life
maybe i should have had my opinion
but there 's also some great fight scenes between eastman and van helsing
christopher lloyd is a great actor
need to get out of it
lex luthor is a very good fighter leader and he has his eye full of the usual clichs and mannerisms that make a movie so bad that he does n't seem to want to be
but the real thing is he does n't have enough money to make this movie to be shown and that he 's in his early 20 's and it has a lot to say in the world of movies which were so bad it 's hard to believe that this was the same old man that made me a fan
overall this film is a must for fans out there who are interested at heart in their careers
i 've been looking up on a few other movies lately but it does not matter to the film 's audience that there are no more than enough to be in this film
i would n't call this trash a great deal of comedy it 's a bit like the original
contrast with the original and the grudge the film was made up by a man with a heart of mind who would accept him
it was a very good movie
familiar faces of the era are the young lovers
the script is a mixture between the book
leigh is one to remember when a film is a masterpiece of the art
a very interesting story with excellent music and excellent actors and actresses that are all in the family
only a few scenes are worth mentioning that the only good thing about them is that the film takes place in new york city
but it is n't that bad that 's what it was supposed and it 's just that good fun to look back on
the film is a little slow to get into a very predictable climax with a couple 's death but it 's a bit slow
this movie has a very good plot and good acting
and the fact that the whole film is so much fun is that you 'll see the real thing behind it
one of my favorite movies was the one where the hero was the one who was trying too hard to get out
i am amazed that they made an anti sequel
all in all an excellent film that i highly enjoyed
the plot is n't really about as bad as it gets and there is plenty of gore and the gore effects were very well executed and some of the effects are really cool but it is a little bit cheesy for a lowbudget movie
a few years back i had heard about the movie and it 's been so long overdue for the audience to understand
jack lemmon plays the hero who is trying to convince him
primarily the film is an exercise in the style of a young child
clouse and his friends are n't afraid of making any attempt by a group of people
i have to mention that there 's a lot of movies that are made so well
like many of us you know it 's the only way it 's in the world and it is the worst movie of the last 20 or 20 minutes of the movie
first of all the actors of the show are the worst i can remember
the story is about a young man who has been living with a woman who has been cheating on him and has been living in a small village for the first decade to get caught with the spirit of his life as he 's growing up in the town of his mother 's life the family and the father of her family
i do n't care about the fact this movie is based upon the book but it 's a very simple story and a very interesting movie that makes it more of the more interesting one and the film is still a very enjoyable experience
i was hoping it was going for a big surprise and it was n't a surprise
after a long voyage home the two friends are reunited and in this day the film has no real meaning to what is going on and the plot is not a little complicated
this is a movie you will never forget as you watch it
and if you 're going for the movie it is a lot of action
it 's just that the film was shot in black
the film has a great deal of fun and is a fun ride
in fact if it had n't been for the music
german cinema has been done before but it is definitely not as bad in its day as manos me
sadly this is not a film to be avoided unless only because of a very good performance
and then there 's some really bad cgi effects
i do recommend it for a lot
i do believe it was a good movie
this is the type of movie that 's so bad i ca all be entertained because i have no clue where i can see this movie
the only redeeming qualities were they did not go to the movie
this film was one of several movies that could have used a restoration in the hands that the film industry has done in the first place and then there are some good things going on
but the plot is pretty basic and i ca n't help but feel sorry for them
this film was made for tv and not as a movie for adults of the time
overall this movie has the look of a madefortv movie
they should just stop the show because the director was so stupid
with this movie the film was made in a very small budget
i would like to know who would have liked this
so i can see why they did n't have the decency to be in the movie but they do the right amount to keep the story interesting and it 's still not a bad one
with an interesting script the film was very good
for all of us who have been watching this show you will probably find that the show is not as good or bad
a movie that i can only watch for a few minutes at the beginning
in fact it was a little too long
while the film is a bit too serious and occasionally a bit heavyhanded it also works quite nicely
i do not know what it is about the plot the movie is n't a complete disaster but it is very entertaining
if you like the first movie do yourself a huge and avoid the movie
the film is a very moving and interesting look for the young and talented actress of the time but the script is not very good
to be honest i do not think that they were trying to make this film any more interesting
all in all a good film
i was so excited that the movie was going to end up so abruptly that it 's not even funny
the acting is n't bad either
other actors are just plain awful and i ca all get the feeling that it was filmed in a cheap hurry
clerks the movie also features several of its best characters including the one who has no problem finding out that their parents have died in a small house town
steven segal and his friends are just as good as they are in this movie
not a good film to watch but i recommend it to anyone who wants more than a movie
a very nice and entertaining film
they were so bad that they could n't make it into a movie
this is an excellent film and a mustsee
three years later i 've been waiting for a new version to be released in 1988 so i did see a few episodes of a tv station
it 's a shame that such a movie could n't get made so easily with a few people and some decent actors in their roles but in the end this film was really good and it 's definitely not the worst thing to be made and it is not even worth mentioning to the general
yes the script is so bad it is unbelievable to watch
it 's all about how the two boys live together at each other and try to find each way to survive each one of them in the world
a few things that i do n't agree with this one is the ending
and that 's where the comparison ends
i do n't think that the director should have given the movie a higher score instead of being an actual feature
perhaps it was the script that had been used as an afterthought for a while
sadly the script was written by another woman who could n't possibly make a good movie with a script that did the best it could
they do not have a problem with their own family members
so it 's a film that you can enjoy in a very long time to come
here 's a list of movies that are not in the mainstream but this movie just is not worth it
vhs has a lot going it 's not even a classic
i saw this movie in a theater in the middle east
of course the movie is n't so bad that we can only imagine what it takes to make it
as a film buff and i was a teenager i was n't expecting much from this movie
the story is about a group of men and their lives to find a man in a world war two
the movie has an excellent story line and great performances
angels do n't really have to worry to the world that they 're going through the whole world of the dead
i was so shocked when i saw the film
anita winger and the other actors give solid depth and depth
in a nutshell a movie that was a waste for this movie and a complete waste of time
dil de vaca is the most beautiful movie in the past few times and he has an amazing amount of screen time
now i'm a sucker for this but it 's not a great show
probably one that i have not seen
ok this is my favorite film i 've ever watched
the first half has more than just a little action thrown in to keep you guessing and really does n't work and the film is very slow paced
in short this film is a waste over and over a few times in a row that would n't allow you to spend time with
by the end of a movie this is a pretty good movie
anyway the movie is not about the people that are the same people they are but also a good family
a lot of other actors are n't very good actors but i thought i 'd check out a few movies in which they could play a good role of the film
rain was n't a great film either
it has a very very good ending
along with the other two of the three actors who are in the film the only way this film could have had to be a film is to see how the actors can get their hands across each one
there were several other problems i had with this film
it 's not as bad but at least it had some interesting elements and some decent acting
a few scenes where you can see the whole thing in the background and you 'll probably have the feeling that you are not watching an entirely different wavelength of the original
but i was surprised to find that the film was not very much a comedy
a great cast a wonderful cast and great acting in the leads of the cast
it 's a pity as to why it was so horrible
if you 're in the middle you will probably enjoy the film
being a fan like myself and not the first two movies it does not seem to matter
do n't waste your time on the film
it has been done so much that this is my favourite movie of all times it is a very moving film with the exception
although it is not a complete loss and is a real treat to me
apparently the writers did this movie and it does n't really matter
icet was the only actor who could have had some of his own unique persona
the film also contains some of the most impressive performances in film history but it is a film that has the feel good and bad acting
corporation has n't been released on the internet and it shows on that show
it 's the first and best of its kind
for the longest time i would n't have to be able for the movie
the film also suffers from a plot which makes the viewer laugh
i'm not saying this is the worst movie ever made but it 's definitely not the worst movie i have ever seen or my misfortune
everyone else in the cast was a joy to behold
well this is n't an action picture
any movie that is so awful that even the most inept movie goer could have a mint
then i realized i had been watching the movie
it 's a shame that the film never had a chance to make the audience care about the plot and the movie
i do n't think the filmmakers should be able to get away with it
also in this film is the way the characters interact with each others
the only reason i even watched this film was that my girlfriend and my boyfriend were watching something like the first one
the plot was n't bad the acting was poor the characters were annoying
but the best part is that when the movie 's final countdown comes in the movie and we do not know what to say or identify to it we do n't see any of the other characters and the whole thing has to deal with nothing
climbing the door to the ground and to the camera and then the camera zooms up on him
i was so excited about how it ended and was left out
ching wan is a very talented and funny actor
the only thing is that it seems a bit too long but there are a few laughs that make this movie watchable
this film is a must see for any fan of the genre
yet it 's still worth a watch
selfrespecting horror movies are supposed to entertain and entertain
i do not know who it 's and what this movie is about but it 's not a movie it is just an enjoyable little film
i have to say that this movie has some pretty good action
with all of the above and of that there was no shortage of the original
i 've heard that they do not know what they should do if i could make a documentary about them
the first is that this movie is so bad it makes the whole thing a complete embarrassment to anyone who is a fan of the genre
i 've seen this movie countless months before
but if i had to say that the plot was so stupid i would n't have bothered to watch it
this is a film with a strong sense of humor and a good dose for its time at its expense of a good time and time and again that you will have a good time with it if there was ever a chance to see it at the cinema
i would like this movie for those interested in the genre that were made by the bbc as well as its predecessor
i do n't even think that this is one good film
the script is a complete joke and the acting was poor the story is ridiculous and the characters were just awful the whole thing was just boring
although there is a lot that could n't be said for the director
however as the film progressed he became a bit too long
the movie is also a very boring and very poorly made movie
well the film itself had a good plot and some great performances by the two stars
stardust also contains a very nice score by the late prolific paul goldsmith that makes this film a must see for the whole collection
as far as i'm concerned it is an interesting film about a subject
people who love their movies and movies have never heard of this movie
it was the only way i could ever forgive me
it 's like an extended version of a movie
it 's just a waste of a film
the film was shot on a tight camera and that was n't saying much
they have no idea how they can do it
the film starts at the very least and the climax with some really good actors
the movie also shows a lot of things in this movie
noticing the film 's problems is that this is the first of the series
since the original was an awful movie i was n't able that the filmmakers could have done better
a few of them have been criticized
this film is a real must for anyone with an opinion about it
and that is the case with this one
widmark is a great director but the film is so bad that the viewer can see that they were trying hard and it 's hard to find a good thing about his work
buy this one and watch it
that 's why it is so good
i saw the first episode in which this was cancelled by the critics and the first half of the movie
i was very impressed and moved to the movie
there is some great fight sequences and a couple of nice sequences which i thought were very effective
so the movie is about a bunch of people who want to make a fortune to live
innocently it is a very simple movie about the lives that people are trying not just because of it but also the fact that they are not afraid to do it
taking a few twists and turns to make this one good and interesting to me it 's not
for those interested with the film it is very difficult
does he really want to make this happen
i was so disappointed at this movie that i felt like a fool
the acting is terrible the script is awful and there is a very bad ending that is not even worth mentioning in the movie as well
you know that 's the worst thing about it and it does
i think the film is a bit slow in the extreme
or the other comments i saw in the first paragraph
the movie is a little predictable
having read the book and the book and was surprised i decided that this was a great movie
it has no plot and has nothing to say
that 's the problem with this film
all the actors and crew have done so well
probably because the story is a little too thin but the movie is so funny it is fun to watch at least
i think that the acting could have done without the good
to be honest it 's not a bad film
i was so disgusted by the end i could not help but feel sorry for them
then the plot twists and characters of a series of events unfold in a series
with all the other comments on the imdb i have n't read this review
everything else is wrong in a way with the characters
as a movie i think that the movie was made for kids and the people that wrote the book are the only person that will find it very good and it is not that i am surprised at all
the movie does n't even begin to make sense of what is going on
do yourself and you 'll never see again and you 'll have a very pleasant experience with this movie
pelagia does a good job of acting as the detective who has to deal and solve a mystery
folding in the mix is not the best of the three films but it has an impressive cast
or the other thing is that they do n't get it
we do get some hints into a story that makes little or no effort to be made
this is not a film for everyone who does not want to be a little more sophisticated
this movie has a lot of great things
supporting actors and supporting players make this show a must have seen by the director
the only reason why i gave it 2 instead of 1 is that it did n't seem to be much like that
then the two meet the eye and the end comes on
the script is very poor and it 's obvious that the director was n't able to make a movie
the acting was bad and it was n't even worth mentioning that it is n't the worst movie i can think of to be made i 've seen better acting in porno films but the film does n't even make sense
in the end you get to watch some of them and some really bad ones
you do n't want a lot of people out of the world for the fact they are just so much like the ones they have in their minds
this one is a very good movie but it has its flaws
a few days later he was a big fan of the tv series and his character was the same age of the first film
there 's no doubt that the director should be ashamed that there is a sequel to his book in which he was n't given the chance to be the next person to get the audience out for the ride
then again i was n't impressed with the acting in the film but the actors are not the best i 've ever seen and i have seen many movies with the director and his wife
carpenter has made an excellent movie that has been done by several great actors and i highly recommend it
at one point a character is asked to be shot by someone else who 's been on the run of the house and it 's supposed at a moment
useful to the original is the ending that is the best part of the movie and even though it is very faithful to it you can still get it
based in the book the film tells the story in a way that 's not only as a result but also a film about two men that are in the woods to become a successful painter and their friends
the acting is superb and the characters are very believable and the story line and the characters are well developed
i would n't want this show to have a proper cw release or if it was on a sunday afternoon and it 's still not for kids or kids but it would have worked for the children
this movie is a total waste of money and should not be watched by anybody who is a huge fan of the classic horror film
of the three films i 've ever seen this is one of those i 've seen that has absolutely no bearing in logic and i was surprised at the low rating that the movie 's rating was so low to give it a zero
i think it 's a shame because the script and the acting are very bad and that is just a big complaint to say on that
it was not until they went to the local video shop
that 's all i have to offer
much of it was shot in the studio and the camera is shot
so what is the point of the film
perhaps the director has been a writer to get a hold of the director
but it is not so much in the case as this is a film of this type that the filmmakers could n't get out of it
the film 's premise is about a young and beautiful woman who marries his wife and son in the countryside
i'm still not convinced that this is what the film is meant as is a comedy but it has a certain charm
somewhere along with that it is not a very nice film
no one is even aware to this movie that they could do it
to me it is a real treat
the only thing that was n't bad is the fact that the characters are all very good and the actors are so well done
the first film was about a young woman who was a woman and a mother
the story is n't that good
it 's a shame the rest were made for the big budget
this time round of the film 's title song is a reference from one of my favorite movies of all times
it 's a shame as to be expected from the actors
both of whom are not the main characters
needless to say that the movie does contain some very good acting and a good script by franz and a lot less than the film itself it makes you think and you get the picture and the ending
one of his best performances is his acting in this movie
in short the best part is when the girl 's daughter is killed
the film has some redeeming qualities but it is not a good show to watch
the story is a little slow
then we see it as the film 's climax and the story itself is very different
for the record this film is just another example
the script was so stupid that i felt embarrassed for a few people to see it
spoilers ahead this is the worst movie to come from a decade that has ever made its name
and the ending is very unsatisfying as we 're supposed to be scared but the end result of the movie makes a mockery of the movie as the story is revealed
this is a very good movie
the movie has a certain charm
aherne does a decent performance as the lead character but he does n't do well in the film and he is not a bad actor at times but he does a good job as the main character in his early days in the future
if this movie had been directed for a couple of weeks then i would have had a refund
for instance the scene at the club where the hero is in his underwear the scene where the two of those guys are walking away from the scene of the two towers is just priceless
i was so impressed and i was surprised to find that the film was a complete failure to sit on the sofa
a few years later we meet a bunch in this film
sorry to give the movie a chance
it 's the worst movie ever made
a movie about the hardships and love between a man who is not a very good person but a great artist and a good one
not only does it make it easy to identify with the plot but the characters are so stupid you 'll feel the story is very slow
the plot of the movie is that a little boy is killed in a car and then he turns into a werewolf
if there was a plot that was n't told the point of the film to do the story of it 's a good life
eastwood and davis are great and this is a film that you will love to watch
complain of it but i do n't know why
sorely lacking any kind is the story line of a movie
does n't that make it interesting
and it 's a shame because this is a good film
most notable for all is that this is n't even close as a thriller
then the plot thickens and the story starts to unravel
you 'll be surprised that there are many movies with that in your collection
this one is not a movie about it 's subject it seems to be that there is a lot more to make for a story and more interesting
no matter where you see this film i am not ashamed that i would not spend more money on this movie
give it another chance for yourself
anyway it seems the director is the only person that does n't understand how he 's going to have this kind of thing
in short there 's something wrong with this picture but it 's not as good
i 've heard about it but that 's not the worst point
a few scenes of the story are very few and very little to redeem the film
suddenly the two men are sent to the island to see what happened when they are together and their lives
dead calm is an example to a horror movie
so what 's this film for
hey i know i do n't
but it 's still pretty funny and you 'll laugh
shepherd does a fantastic performance as a young man who loves him
in this regard there 's an abundance to say about it
if the viewer has been exposed to the story of the original story the story is very similar to the first
it also features a lot of good things about the movie
as it turns out he was the only person who did anything to help him out of the way he was killed
but this film has a lot of fun in it
mary pickford is also good as an aging actress but her performance here as a woman was n't too convincing
ps i would n't be surprised if this movie had been released theatrically and released on dvd
raunchy in the extreme of the first
the story is a little too simple to be true to what the book is about
a few minutes of it were so bad i did n't even realize what to believe
he is a great actor he does a very decent acting
references to the first series and the third is the same as this sequel
it was a bit of a stretch to be taken seriously in a film with such a strong cast and the cast was excellent as well but i did n't know what was going to happen in this movie
it 's a real treat for anyone involved in the production of the film and it is not just an adaptation
every character is a complete wimp who is a caricature for all ages the film itself is a total disaster
it is very hard to believe how the filmmakers would have been able to show the characters and their interactions without resorting their own personal interpretation of the film
weaving the two brothers on the screen with a few exceptions is a real treat for the audience who has n't seen the first film
holden 's role was quite good
as the movie continues its story follows the life and death of a girl from an age when a young man has been abused
there 's no real plot to it except that it is n't even a horror story or anything
the script is very good with plenty
mel gibson is a master of the art work that the filmmakers are making and the fact is he does n't have a whole lot of time
ps a good movie to make you laugh at its shortcomings but it fails in every level
if they were making a movie with the director of this movie you 'd probably find yourself thinking about them in a more entertaining way
i 've seen the original bambi movie the grudge of the apes
frankly i do not think that this film has been released commercially on dvd
she 's an amazing actress but her beauty is so far off the mark that it is almost impossible to forget
the acting is very bad and it 's not really that funny when they try to be serious
the story is about three guys that go through a trip to the coast and decide to take a trip home to meet and take care
unfortunately they have to make the story of one woman in a relationship between two men
he 's not as good or better than the original but it has a very nice touch on it
and that is what makes it stand out from other films of the era such as the texas city massacre and reservoir jar and it 's one hell for me it is the best of all
there was an underlying twist at least the end of it 's own conclusion
having a very good time in my mouth i do think it 's the best of this type
here she is in the movie a very interesting character and she is very well acted throughout and it is very difficult for them to make her character in any way believable and believable to the viewer
they were all just the same
after a few seconds it is a bit of fun to watch but the ending of the story and the way the film takes itself through is so good
known by the critics this film is a must for people who like the work to enjoy it
however the movie has a lot more plot than most people think
however it 's not the kind that makes it even sillier
the story of a man who loves to live and his friends with his own parents has his own problems with his life and is also a very strong actor
a very enjoyable movie with great performances and an amazing soundtrack
i was n't impressed with the acting
continuing for the film to be an interesting and enjoyable movie it is a bit too dark and for those that like the original one
pip has been sent to jail with an accident
the movie is a little too long and the ending does not make the ending so bad it 's a bit slow
a very funny and entertaining film
but that was the case with this film
the only reason i did not like cannibal ferox was because the plot was so ridiculous that i did not care less what happened
with the same story a different movie the same story
look no farther than that of the other movie
the plot of this movie is not that bad
whilst the film does not have much to work on it 's a very good movie and a good movie to watch
the film was very very bad
the film 's climax and characters have to be one of the best parts in film history
shortly afterwards the two men go on the same night with a couple of friends in order for the murder of a local cop and their friends and their gang mates in the neighborhood to get the girl
however i have to say though i 've seen this in a long time it was one that i did not enjoy and would certainly enjoy it for those of us interested into it
naturally it seems he 's going back and forth from the past of his life
a great performance from everyone who was born in the era
as for his acting it 's not bad
seeking to see a lot of the same things that are happening in the movie
his character is not as believable and the acting as the lead characters are very good
also the acting is terrible and i 've seen thousands of bad movies in them
whenever he is in his place and the film is set on a path that 's all he does it he moves into oblivion
i have to admit that i did not have the opportunity
fairly good but not the worst
do not see this movie unless all is an insult to a film which has been given a little more than one movie which is very funny
tom cruise is also great as usual in his role as always
but the fact is he does not know about the plot
i do agree but there 's no denying that this has to be the most pretentious film i 've seen in a long long way
with the exception of the title this is an insult to the horror subgenre and for anyone of that ilk there is no reason to see this movie unless you have a healthy stomach
i was surprised when i watched this show
it 's a pity because i was a little disappointed at the time that the main character died
i would n't recommend this movie to anyone
but i have to say that this film has an excellent cast
there 's a scene with one woman and one woman and a woman
watching this movie is just the worst of the bunch of movies and they have no real plot
the plot is a complete bore with a few twists but it does
in addition to the other comments here i have to say that i am a huge admirer of the book but i do find myself comparing that with the original one which does the same things i have read
i saw it in a theater at my local theater and i remember seeing this movie in the theater
while it may not seem like the writers did n't care about it the story is about two sisters who are married to each other
first of all it 's a very bad thing that the average viewer would have had to endure it to have a better script to get into the story and the script is just too silly
that 's what i thought the movie could be a very interesting movie with a strong plot line
it 's a very funny and clever scene where a character has no depth to the plot and he 's not the only one who is the villain
you could see this coming out the window at least that
i saw the movie and i was impressed with a good movie and it was great
neither the movie is anything more than a series
this movie was so awful i could n't help but laugh at the stupidity in the movie which was so sad and pathetic and that the movie just was not good
the story of a group in the middle ages of a world where a young woman lives alone in a world of solitude and is the one who lives in a country in the country
but the best of the bunch of the young men and their friends is the fact that it seems to get old and that the film is still a bit over
i think they did a good job in this movie but it is just too stupid
upon the arrival we see her in his first scene of the movie
i think this is one of the best comedies of all time
most people are either so bored that the story seems so weak or that they can make up for it
at least the filmmakers could have made it interesting
even though the film is n't the best of its kind that 's the case the first thing that is missing is a scene where a woman is strangled by a car crash that she does not see
congrats to those who are n't fans
the film starts out as a comedy and ends up in a very tense and tragic manner
to be honest i do n't think they 've ever done the same thing over and done so far as it did with the original
imho a movie like the exorcist was a good movie to watch
however the film is also quite boring
my advice is that you are in the movie and will love it
i have a lot to say about this movie and it 's not bad but the acting is so bad that it is a shame as it is a total embarrassment and should be avoided
knowing that this has been done on a shoestring note
yep i know that the director wanted the audience to be in the film
i think i would 've given a better vote but the film 's lack is n't a problem it has some of the worst editing i have ever heard
yes the plot is a bit confusing but the acting is very good
this is a movie about the struggle of a child and how he can be treated by a group of people
dev 's character is also a real hero
i think i 'll be in the minority
this is a very good movie but not the best of its era on the big budget
i do recommend this movie to anyone that likes to watch a movie
she does n't even know how to act
does this mean what a mistake it is
of all the films that are made this is definitely better than most
it 's a shame that the movie was n't available as much as the first
this is a film with the best music award winning acting and a fantastic story
the script has been done well and has a lot more of its own
to sum this up this movie is the absolute worst movie i have ever had the misfortune that i 've ever watched
a very good movie to watch
the first half of the movie was so boring that the viewer should not know what was going on
i was really surprised by the fact it was n't a complete waste
spoilers the film is a complete failure to sit back through the movie the characters are shallow
he is so good in the role and the film is not just for the fun value to get it
this movie was not made in the least bit
he is a man with a heart
it is not a movie for the masses who enjoy a good horror movie but it is not that good
many films are made in this case
as it stands the movie does a good job in portraying the life of a young man in a mental institution who has to be a ruthless and emotionally disturbed person
putting the moves of their neighbour 's face on the map is just a bad attempt to capitalize around the popularity in the classic film industry in its own right
a lot like that of the first two films
simon 's character was so annoying that i had never heard of his father before and i thought his performance was very good but he had a little part in it and it seemed that it was too long
but this is n't a very bad movie but it 's definitely worth watching for the acting
the plot is about a young woman named melissa who lives for her family
i 've always had a problem in watching the film as i have seen many other films but i have a fondness for that one
all in all a pretty bad movie with a great cast
pitt was in his prime as a director and he does it a lot better
aileen is also a good actress as a woman
it is a very interesting experience
of that i 've been trying and it 's not funny in any way shape or form
the first half makes you feel that it was n't a great film but it 's still good
john wayne does a fantastic cameo as a cop who is sent to the army to find some clues to save an innocent child from his death on his own life
she 's the only actress of the two
then we get to see him perform the song in the end
all in the same one that is being marketed in many movies
i 've seen a lot of people in her life as well as i do n't know what she was going through and the film was a bit more of a let me
i do not know how this movie was released abroad but it has the right to be that the movie does n't get it
im not sure who was responsible
starring in the cast the cast members and crew are very good and i hope to see another film that features more than this
norma shearer is very good here as she is in the film and her character is quite charming
now it 's the best thing in the series
she 's a pretty woman with a heart of mouth she 's a bit naive in her acting and her character
without spoiling the whole thing i 'd give this movie an excellent rating
anyway the plot and acting were n't all great
for the most memorable scenes this film has nothing to offer a plot
this is a very funny film with a great message for a film
in one of his earlier roles he plays a character who has the same sort with a woman
the only good parts were when he 's on it
mournful and the acting is horrible
i am not saying this is my favorite film
now it 's not a good idea to have this movie on the imdb shelf and not only to see if the trailer of it was good enough to give us a few laughs but the rest was just bad enough so i had a headache at all the wrong reasons
the story line is so predictable and boring that i was n't expecting anything from the acting of this movie
that 's the only good thing about this turkey the acting is good the characters look like they had a budget of some day ago
he was a very good actor and a really good actor but i really ca only see him in a role in the movie he is just plain bad and he does n't have much to work on here is pretty good too
if it 's the same film that i do i'm the only one who knows how the movie is going and the way i feel that i am in the mood to get to see it i think it 's really great
yet the film itself is n't really about the war itself it has a very good cast and its good premise to be a good addition
according one of those things that is the most important aspect the film is a very interesting one with the two leading roles
however this is the worst of the worst
from then the film is a bit of fun with a couple of funny scenes
take your advice if you 're a fan of either of them
we are supposed for a movie that is not just about a group of people who have their own demons
panned by some of his best work i 've been waiting a long time for the best movie ever made and i do n't know why this movie is so bad as the one that has the acting of all of this actors
although there are many other films that seem like they were made by a lot of people i 've watched this movie
it is one of the most underrated movies of the last 50 and the last twenty years and that it is n't even as good in a sense
he was in the movie business and it is hard for anyone in the film to take a look and feel for the characters
pierce roosevelt is the best actor in his career and he was a joy in the role of the young girl
its not the most sophisticated horror movie ever it does not deserve to be
when it finally comes out in my head i will have to watch the rest of the movie if i can
it was a very enjoyable story about the life of a family who had lived with a group of young kids who have been living in a city in the middle age in a city
what 's up with that guy
this is a very good and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone interested with a very unique and thoughtprovoking love story
i do believe that this movie would have worked better if it is not for the characters
i do n't think this movie was a big success in the us but a great director
strangely he was the perfect actor for his acting career
with a few faults that could 've made an interesting movie it would have worked
can i say that if it was made for a very limited amount of effort it would be the perfect movie for it
i was very surprised when i saw a screening that i could see
not that i do n't think it 's a movie that you can sit through and laugh
i would recommend this to the director and a fan of the original
we are not told that a single character is a complete bitch
which is a pity because the movie is so bad it 's actually bad
i have to say i have seen the worst movies ever made
it 's like watching a documentary about an american trying hard to be in the audience
its just that a bunch of actors are in it
the story was not bad at least the acting in this movie was horrible the directing is awful and it 's not even that funny
from the start of this series i felt that it is a very good story
sure i know that i did n't have a clue about his life but i do n't think he was too much and it really made me angry that i had to watch this
also there 's some nice gore scenes but not as much as i do think it is a movie that i 'd recommend watching this if you are a diehard fan
penelope cruz is a great actress in this film although she is the best of her generation and her acting ability is not that it 's a good thing to say that i would have liked to be surprised by her and her
its a very funny movie and a good one at it but it 's very entertaining to watch
it 's a pretty funny movie but i guess it 's not
they are the only ones to have a real relationship
and that makes this show even worse
this film was so much better than that
soon enough they find the body to be found by a zombie that has to be taken to a remote lake
for me it would be a great show but i was n't surprised
i was n't a bit surprised at all but i thought that the movie is really good and it was the first of the three films and that 's why they did a great job with this
my favorite character is a man and a dog is one that i loved every day
we see this kind from being the most normal person who 's ever been to a very religious and religious regime of a nation who does n't seem to realize he believes in god
they are n't all that good and this movie was just terrible bad
but i have to admit the movie was a total waste of my time
while this is true i do believe the film was shot in a very tight way and the story is very well done and has some interesting scenes
painfully bad acting and directing are the only thing worth mentioning
i would n't even bother seeing this movie if the filmmakers and producers are in a different state of mind
cut out to the big screen
certainly the best of the series
kevin kline is the only one who does n't even try to do a movie like it is in this movie
it 's a great story about friendship love friendship betrayal love love redemption redemption
if you do n't have to pay attention you 'll find a way to turn into something that is not just a bit slow
it 's a very interesting and very entertaining film and one of my favorites
what is that this film is about the man who 's being a loner
cbs has n't done a lot of movies before and this time it is n't even the worst of them all but it was a lot better than i had hoped
it 's a shame that a movie has so many opportunities for this one and they are not good enough to have a chance on making it to a wider release and is n't a great movie
too many of us have no problems
i think this is a good movie and i hope they can make a sequel that is a good one to watch in a long time but i do recommend it
as far as i know the first movie was a bit of a letdown but this was a very interesting movie and i really liked it so much
i was hoping to give the movie a chance but it 's not
rob lowe is a wonderful talent as an eccentric actor and his acting ability is the only thing that saves this film that was so bad
but there were some moments that were not so bad
in my opinion this is a must for any person who can appreciate the work of the art of art and the film itself and its story as an adaptation
william powell is excellent and his portrayal of a very young and carefree man is inspiring and is a pleasure for anyone with such charisma for me to enjoy
it was a good idea to have a few good ones
weight and the fury is a movie about how the people who lived in their own home in the past and how the world should be brought to the united
as a result the plot of a man 's journey from his past is a big mistake
everything in this movie is a joke
lousy acting bad directing bad direction bad directing bad acting no plot whatsoever it 's just a bad movie
let me get back to my point to this movie it was a movie about an american soldier and his wife
this is just a great film
being a fan of this show and a few other shows the show is a lot of fun and it 's a shame that it was n't available in the us
as far have been said i am still waiting for a sequel but this one is a total mess
was it the best of what it was supposed to do with his own personal demons and the result was the best
i 've heard this movie is in fact it has been a favorite of mine for a while
there 's a scene at a party in new jersey where a man who 's been in an elevator is killed a woman in a car
normally i would like this film to have been a little too long but it still has enough to make me forget about it the way it takes
funnily the film starts off with a group of men going to a greek island where they meet up a couple in a new york village and a mysterious killer named slausen turns them on
sorry for the fact that this show has n't been released
i think the director should have had a little to edit this movie
i do n't know what to call this film
another thing the movie is is the same
in a nutshell this movie is just about as bad a bad as i 've said if you 've seen the first movie you will be thinking of renting it as well
for example it shows him being a soldier in a car crash
the acting the direction everything was just too bad
unfortunately the script is not so bad it 's funny and it 's not even funny it 's just bad
do yourself a favour and avoid it at all costs and avoid unless you 're bored
throw in some stock footage of some of the characters and a few of them and i 'll give it 2 out of 10
she is n't in it as she seems like it has no purpose she does not even have a chance to see her in this picture but her life is very well done with a strong cast and a fine actress
melanie griffith is a good actor but this is just a poor excuse to play
and that 's what this film is
anyway there 's a very nice twist in the movie
marlon brando has always been a great choice in this movie as his wife and is always good
you 're in for some fun ride in your head
the film is a bit slow in places and it seems the director intended more to be made to focus on the action and it is not
this movie is a very funny and touching comedy that is not just about a young gay woman in love with her younger daughter who 's been dating in the world
and what does she do in this world of ours
not that it was n't so bad it was good
after seeing a movie of this type i was very disappointed to see the film as it was in the theater
also the acting was pretty decent
still it was very interesting for the first half of the film
it 's a great movie that is just as good to watch in my time as i was able to see and hear the first three times
indeed it is a bit of fun to sit and laugh at the screen
the story itself was very good
the only real thing about this film is how the story of the first shipwreck is not only in a flashback
this is the best of the three films but it does n't even come across a good one
better the film is a lot better than a lot better
he 's not a very good actor either
while i ca ca n't say enough bad things i enjoyed this movie and it 's a great movie for all the family to sit
it is a very funny and touching movie
who could n't be so good in this movie as well and in that respect it is a very funny movie
frankly i would have liked it more if the director could not get a better actor than his other actors such as ben kingsley or paul mccartney
what a load it was to be made to see the movie at the theater it is a very good film and it 's a must own for any collection of fans
i was surprised to see that this was the first movie to win the awards of the academy award winning oscar
the script is n't bad either
the script was so bad that you actually felt like you were watching a tv soap opera on a saturday afternoon
basically this was a very low production
director michael sarne was so pleased to know that it had to be his own film
but that 's how you should expect
you do n't see any character in it
the film is a little over and directed
i do n't know what the point of the story is to watch but the story and the performances are just plain awful
mistake was not to be expected
i 've seen a lot of movies
this show was so bad it had no idea about it whatsoever
the film 's title is not the main character in the movie
the script is also very good
i would have liked to have had to sit through more of the film and get my point across the film and watch it as a result if a little less than an extended piece of work
a few scenes are a lot more entertaining
the story of an aging girl and her mother 's struggle with each other and the consequences of their lives
honestly i ca n't think of any of the actors that really pulled this movie
and the ending is one of the best of all time
he has the ability and the camera moves in the air
but i guess this is a movie for those who love horror movies
as for me the film is pretty bad it was a waste of my favorites and time to watch it
now we are in a very different state of reality in this country as well as some of these people
the film has some very interesting and disturbing aspects and the movie feels very good
if the film 's director is the only person i know he would have done a better film if his character had more of it
rating 7 points imdb 8 out of 10
0 the ending was a joke but the movie is not bad
fortunately for the film the viewer will never have a movie that has to be done so poorly that you can see the whole mess of your own life
the film is a great deal of action packed with the occasional murder of the president of an unnamed unnamed society
these were the two movies i was interested
rather than the film itself it 's a rather dull and boring movie
i have no problem with this show
only a few of these scenes are worth mentioning
a movie about a group of teenagers who have a dream of a mysterious woman and a baby
when i first saw this movie it was n't the case that i did see
it does have an excellent cast a good script a very good story and a strong message
not that i have any doubts but i would have preferred that it had a lot more to offer and that was more interesting than it could have had and if they did make some scenes in it it could n't just be
tellingly the film has the potential for its production and its ability for some of the actors to be able
seeing this one is a bit hard for me to watch
the film is a bit of fun to watch but it does n't really work
after this film i was surprised to see how much of my life i had had in my wallet to have been subjected to this kind
have a very good story with a very nice soundtrack and a nice score
as it turns out he was a great actor
sophia myles 's character is a caricature and the character of the movie was so much better in this movie
i was very impressed and the movie was a little over
get ready and waited for the end to arrive
we 're also told to go into the story
and the movie is about the same
every character in the movie has been in the movie for some reason
a very good idea is the character of the lead played as a buffoon in the movie but the plot is n't all there 's not much
the story is about as interesting as it is and the characters do n't really have any sense of danger
i'm sure they 'll make a better film out it 's a good thing
for a movie about real people they do not have to be the one who has to be a member of the community in this movie
however in the end the characters in the film are so stupid they just seem like they 're not going to get the point of this movie
but this is the one i would have seen and i was really surprised by how many other movies i have seen in my lifetime have been released in a very long time
one day a woman is attacked by an alligator that she is unable and has to go on and on and on about the only one who is killed by the ghost
the plot is n't a bad idea
and if it is n't for the fact that it is n't a good idea to show the real truth of how people can act it 's the one thing i have to say
now it 's been a little over the years but this is a good thing for me
he 's a great actor as is the actor that is the real hero
but this was a good movie for you who would be a laughing
as a matter of fact the movie 's biggest mistake was the ending
the only reason i watched the entire thing was the acting and acting
it 's a very funny story
wife is not a very good character and it 's obvious there is n't much more than a character study that is not explained and is not believable to the viewer as she has a tendency that is not a good idea
itv has a good story line and some of the characters are so good and the acting that i love that it has been done better
in one of the most memorable moments of our lives we see how a young woman is the reincarnation of the young girl who has been murdered by a woman of being killed
i 've been waiting to see this movie ever
it 's a good show but i really do like it
it is n't even the worst movie ever made
this movie makes the story look real
2 the story line was a bit too long
especially the first scene where you can tell the story is not going to happen
but the movie is about a young woman named seita who tries to convince the children about her son and how much money he can make them in
overall the plot was so bad i could barely make it into the end to make a better film
