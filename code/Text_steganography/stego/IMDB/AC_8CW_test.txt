and i do n't want to spoil the movie
bea is a young girl who lives in the town in the world of her life
today i would like to say that this film is a masterpiece
one of the worst movies ever made
i would have liked it more if the actors were given a chance to get to know what is real
my advice is to avoid the dvd player
somewhere in the movie she has an accident that has to be taken with the same girl she has been in her life for the last few months
i 've never been more disappointed
every character in this movie seems to know that there is more about them than the first film
in fact the plot is so simple as to be a good one
everything i have ever heard about this film is it 's not even a good movie
hope lange does n't do anything to dispel the role that this film has
when the film begins i found myself thinking that he 'd been a little more suited to the film than in the earlier version
'a movie that is so bad you want to make your own movies
he is also a very talented actor in this film as the villain who 's supposed to be a hero
first the acting is poor the directing terrible and the plot is a joke
what i liked most about the movie was the ending
this is a movie that has all the elements and makes a good film
awful acting bad writing horrible dialog and bad writing and directing
after watching this movie i thought i was watching an american werewolf movie
the acting is horrible but the writing and direction are good enough so i have to say that i do n't like the movie for being a complete waste of film
it was the first movie i 've had the pleasure of sitting through
a very good film that is worth seeing
however it is not just a comedy
but it was also a good movie
it 's a great film to watch
if you have n't watched it you may be a bit biased
for me the best thing i can say is that it was the first time i ever saw a film so bad i did n't even know what to expect
it was so bad i was so annoyed to see it all
then there 's the fact he is a very talented character actor
seriously you have the recipe for a great film
this movie was not a good one
of course there is a lot of things that are n't so bad
drew barrymore and her supporting cast are also excellent and the film makes a great deal of fun to watch
the movie is also a bit of a disappointment for me but the acting was superb
it was so bad that it was just laughable
anyway if you do n't mind that in the beginning you have to be a fan of the movie and if the movie had a bit more to it than the movie
the story is not about the conflict between the two men of the 19th century and they have a very peaceful world that is not necessarily about it
i'm not one to say that this movie is a complete waste of time and i 've wasted my time with the original version of jane eyre
star wars is the story of a young girl named krishna and her sister who have a very difficult time to get her daughter back together as she does a very good job
then there is a scene with him
some of these scenes are very funny to behold
but the real life is a little too much for the story
thus a few minutes later the film is just about a bunch of kids trying their luck at the same house
apologies is the fact that he was not a hero and it 's a movie that you will see on a rainy afternoon and see if you have the chance to catch the same film
well i have to say that i have a problem with the story
the only reason i even got to see the film is because the movie is not as funny and it is not
i 've seen better acting in the elementary school
the plot is a little farfetched but there 's plenty of fun and the film 's overall jolts is not the least bit of a thriller
but i do n't think that
you can see the movie beforehand it has the same kind of plot and the cast is very believable
it 's not just that the movie is an attempt to make the story of the killer the same as the one in the book
this movie was one of the best i 've seen in years
that being said this film is an insult to all ages the first time it was on tv but it was the worst movie i have ever seen
actually it 's just a movie that is n't very entertaining
do they even have to be a little too young to be able to play the role of an actress who is so stupid
my friend who has never seen the movie and was looking forward to watching this
for a long time i have seen this movie
there are some funny moments such as the rape in the shower scene with the girls in the bathtub and the scene where she says the word about it but you are n't sure what to expect
the acting is horrible the characters are stupid
indeed the movie was a lot of fun
there 's a good chance to give the movie any extra chance to get a good idea
so i was n't going to see it at all but i did n't get it wrong
and the film does n't work
all three of them do well and have to deal
i do n't want to give away any plot spoilers but suffice it to say that i have a lot of friends and i do n't know what is going to happen in the last ten minutes or so
the film is also a complete failure in itself
if you want to see a good movie about a young man you should see this
those who have seen the movie know it is an action movie but i do have it
the film is not a comedy and not only is n't a comedy
also starring john hurt as the evil and the youngest son of the sheik a little too kindly and his father who seems to have a secret of his own
ok it was n't bad but it did n't work
so why does n't the director bother to make it into a comedy
he was not a bad director
i was a fan of the book
this is not a film that should have a clearer message about the war of the holocaust the world is in a different place
there 's a bit of nudity in this movie that is pretty cool
later on the movie turns out to be a very interesting one with a strong plot
i do not recommend this movie to anyone
starsky hutch has a nice body
wooing a woman from his home town with some friends and a little girl who is a bit of a dancer for the younger brother
maggie smith is perfect as the young woman
bel sutherland is a great actor
additionally the movie is a bit dated but the film has enough twists and turns that it 's really worth watching
having a little girl i was n't able to watch it and was surprised by how many women have made it
the first is the first and foremost of the film
even though the plot is n't that bad it was n't bad enough
the movie 's premise of the film is that of a woman who has an obsession with the devil and the two men in a relationship of sorts
ironic to see this is a film that should make you laugh
she has no idea of her past but she 's still living
i think the only thing this movie did not do was it was made by people who wanted to make a movie
there is no way that the director would have had to have allowed to have this movie taken as a comedy
if you like this movie you will probably find it a little more entertaining
he 's the only actor who could have made the role of his head a little better if he had done a much better job
oh and the fact that she is n't the only person that is so beautiful she has to be one of the most gorgeous and beautiful men around
on the plus side the movie is not a comedy
well the movie is a little boring
they have the best actors in a tv movie and the story lines are very very funny and it 's not funny
there is a scene where the father is killed and killed off his wife and a woman
if you can overlook the quality of the story and the acting and the dialogue it 's a must see film
if you want to be entertained then you might find it to be a good movie
the movie is about three guys who have a relationship with their friends and have been in for some time and the relationship between them is very touching
the plot is very simple and the ending of the movie is so much better
you know that it was n't even the best of the two
the movie is also a tribute and a nice movie to watch and i have to see it again in a more realistic way
they do a lot of research and the film does n't even seem to work
this movie was not a very bad one as the worst was just as bad
however if you do n't have a lot of time to waste your life watching this film do n't bother
this show has a lot of good points and has some great actors
but i did not know what was so wrong about the show
worst of all it 's not that great or interesting and i have no idea what happened
the story is very weak it 's not funny at all the movie is very slow and the characters are boring and the story is a little weak
my favorite was when i watched the first movie in the theatre i was very surprised and scared at all the good parts i was in the movie
but then again the story is about an alien who is a bit of a hero
he was a very talented actor who was n't even a hero
hopefully it was a good idea because i did n't like it
one of the most interesting aspects of film is the music the dancing and the music of course and also the music is fantastic
this is the kind of film where the filmmakers seem to be trying to make some money to the director 's intelligence but it 's hard to believe that a film like these would be in the same way that the film was made with a budget that 's not a very good one
just as a movie with a good cast it does n't have the same plot but it has the usual suspects of a typical hollywood horror movie
the acting was bad and the plot had no holes in continuity
if there is a negative message about this film it is the fact that it is based on the real people who are not a communist in real life
the movie is not a bad thing it is a good movie that will keep you guessing until you watch it
frequently he 's the one who 's in his own
if i were to be mistaken for this film i should have known that it had to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the cinema
where do i begin when you see the same guy 's character and he plays the same character
it is a very simple story about a very dysfunctional family and their relationship with their son
the movie is very well made and has some good acting
i have to say it is one of the most original movies i have ever seen
one thing that makes this movie so memorable is how he has managed to make a very entertaining film
when a film that i could like was a little bit longer i had a lot of experience with the story which was n't as good as i was
its a really great story that is told with an incredible story but it does n't work
she 's a woman in her own life and her life is a little over her top
if you want to know a little more about islam and the history of the story i highly recommend this movie
i have seen this movie several times and it 's a great deal to watch and i 'll give it a chance
same as a few other films like the exorcist
liz is in love with her daughter but she does n't want her to go to the woods because the father of the father was n't a child
although i 've always found that the film had been done by the other actors i thought it was quite good but that does n't make sense
under a stern eye for the first time
and it was n't a good idea
i 've always thought that this is a great film
years later i was able to see the movie as a comedy
and that 's the only reason why the rating is so high
he is also a man who is a very human person who cannot get out of the city and he has to do a job to get a job for his own
the story is about a young boy who is sent into a life where the world of god is ruled and his son and his son
you can only get to the end and watch the movie
this movie is just a bad bad bad bad bad movie
douglas is the only actor who can act in this film
the film is a real treat to all concerned
this is a movie about a young man who is a little more suited in the world than he does
one of the most important and funniest aspects of this film is that it is a bit short of being a little too sentimental
that would not have helped me to say this
i was hoping i was going to be bored by this show
one of the best parts of this film is the way it deals with racism
this film is a must see
you do n't even need to have a clue
the film has a very interesting and unique storyline that keeps the action interesting and unpredictable
i do n't know what it is all about it was a little too long for me
although the film was made during the time i was very surprised to find out i was watching a film about a young boy and the girl who were the most powerful characters in the history of history
the plot was pretty thin and the plot twists and turns of the story are predictable
a very good film but not the one
if you 're not into that kind of thing then i recommend that you do n't watch it
when the film 's plot summary the viewer is given a chance to be entertained by the ending of the movie
if you want to watch the original show you know that it 's a lot more fun
most people think they have done a lot of homework and are trying to find out what they do for a little of the movie
apparently this is not an example for the film makers
and it is also very funny
however there 's a few scenes that do drag a few points to a certain level of tension which is n't enough to keep you interested
i think you could get the movie to get more money than i did
i have never read the books and it 's a shame because that was the case
here she was the only actress of the film who had to act in a scene that could have been played more if she could not speak to the camera to be a distraction
you know you 're going to enjoy this
enough the movie has no redeeming features whatsoever
it is a very funny movie but i do n't want to be entertained by the story because this movie has a good cast but the acting was great
i was surprised how much i enjoyed this film
as far as i can remember it did n't have a happy ending
if i had been a fan of the original series i would have given it a zero
buck privates 's character and his motivations are a bit of both
the story is a mess of a movie and a good one
the story is a little too long
antwone fisher is a very funny actor
the acting was n't bad though it could n't have been more so
it is a movie that you have to see
it 's a shame because it did n't have to be made as one of those films where i could n't even sit through it but it was very good to see and i think it is really a great film
sadly the plot seems to be too rushed for a movie but it is n't that bad
i 've seen the original and i have seen many of the same people
it 's not even a bad idea
and there is a great scene in the movie that is a joy
there were some interesting scenes and a few scenes which i liked but it was not a movie to depict the story line and i found it to be a bit contrived at times
one of the most moving and funny parts i 've ever seen
this is just another example of the worst movies ever made
it 's like watching a documentary in a theater and you have the feeling that there was no way out of the story
so i have to go back
i was so impressed to find out that i was in a theater of watching this movie for the longest time and it was one of my favorites
evil dead and wild little kids have a good story and this is one of them
someone who has never been able to make such movies as the original is a waste of time and money
the film opens a bit in an hour and a half
the movie is not for everyone but i think you will enjoy this one
i do n't think it will be because of the way the story is told but rather it 's not very believable
the script is also quite poor
based on the book i was excited to see a lot of things happening and the film was made in a hurry
they are the best and funniest in any way
fred willard has always been one of the most iconic stars of his generation
i was very excited at the way this film was filmed
it is an absolute joy to see how people in a world of social beliefs can behave like this in the most mundane ways
during the film 's opening sequence i was surprised by the acting and acting
but the film 's plot has been reduced to an incoherent plot which is the main reason for the movie
what makes this film so good is that the movie is not a good movie at all
this one is a very bad piece of cinema with no redeeming qualities and is simply a waste of time
it is a shame that they do n't make it to the bottom line of the movie for the rest of the film
with the exception of a few good moments the film is very well made with an excellent cast
i have no problem with the acting and the plot
the movie is about the same kind of guy
do n't worry about this film
this movie is a complete mess
if you 're not a fan of the series i think you should check to get the idea that this is a good film but if you 're looking for a good movie to laugh go see this one
my favourite scene is when the guy tries a new baby with the help of a woman in a room he says that the car is being sold to the hospital
now it is not the worst movie i have ever seen
kids should be able to watch this film for the first time but i do n't have any idea how the film would end up so badly and the fact that the director 's name is n't as good as the other actors
the movie was a complete waste of time but the acting and direction were good and i liked the ending
the movie has a couple of funny scenes and it is a shame that they made more of it
but it is a film that should be watched by everyone involved with the movie
simple story lines are n't enough to save the film
since the movie was made during a very short time there 's a bit of suspense in it too
dennis quaid as the detective is so funny and you 're left wondering what he has been doing
d i do n't get to have the money to see this film
his mother is a great man
it 's like it was a joke
my favourite parts are when the girl in the movie goes to a house and they find that they 're not alone
i do n't even think the movie was funny or even remotely funny
and the story of a young girl with a heart of gold and the consequences to the world of her daughter 's love
hero is n't the best film i 've ever seen in my life
there 's the fact that this is one of those movies that makes you feel like you are not watching the whole movie and just want to watch this movie
anyway the plot is n't that bad at allit is a little bit too thin
one of the best movies ever produced on the scifi channel
it seems so that this movie is n't worth watching
even if you have n't seen the first one you wo n't be surprised
this movie is one of the most awful films ever
i do n't know whether i should have known the characters in the original film were so much less interesting
the only saving grace is the cinematography
with the help of a friend who does n't care to the end he becomes suspicious by the fact that he is a little too reluctant for it
as the story unfolds the film develops a very interesting plot and the two leading actors
thought of it as a film it is very well done but it fails
even the title cards do n't match up
once in a while you get the impression you 're watching a movie about a group of men who have sex and have no chemistry together and the story is so predictable
the movie is n't bad but it 's still good
as a fan of musicals i have seen this one as a very adult and it 's definitely a great movie
reno and jane have a good chemistry with each other
one of my favorite films is the one that makes me want to throw in my balls
having seen the last mimzy the other i was surprised that he did n't get to see it again and i still think it 's a pretty accurate idea
the story was so stupid so unbelievable i was begging myself to watch this movie
really a great movie with a great script and some good laughs
boy 's inhumanity is a great film but not the best
if they had n't made a movie of the week they would have made the film more like a comedy
on this one the only good part of this film is the music and the way the characters are introduced
the story has some similarities with some of the other major problems such as a good dose of the first half hour and a half or so
speaking of which the plot is so convoluted that it does n't work at all as a result of the film itself is a little slow and dull and the story is n't quite good enough to be good
this movie is a complete waste of time if you want to waste your money on a movie
as it happens it 's an interesting story and a good story to watch as a whole
the only real problem with this movie is that it 's not even funny
we 're in for the most part of the film and we get a good feeling for the film 's final act
dreadful and awful i 've always thought of the worst movie ever
i was a teenager when it was over
this is an excellent example of a good movie and it is definitely not for anyone
its not a good idea but the actors are all good
now i know the movie sucks but the story is so boring you 'll have to sit through a movie that 's not worth watching
as far as the plot goes this is one of the few that i have ever seen before
in a way it 's a little more of a comedy with a few moments of comedy and comedy
he is a fine actor and a very good singer
he 's a real cowboy and is n't a bad guy
chud is a must watch for any movie buff
what the hell is this movie going about
also the film is very boring and not even worth the time it takes to watch it unless you have n't yet you wo n't regret it
so the film is full of surprises and the characters are believable
why not make a movie about how they could have a better life
i 've read some negative reviews about this movie
the movie is not a total waste
the movie is very funny and very funny
presumably i am not going to be a fan of a lot of these people to see this one but if i could have the chance to see it in a theater theater i would have been more interested at how it is going to end
i saw this movie when i saw it at the 2005 sundance film festival
glad the film is a little over the top
these two men are also quite likable and the two young actors in the show are all very convincing and believable
i was a bit puzzled with a film like the original and i thought the story was interesting but the story was not a little weak
and it does boast the same theme song in the movie
the film 's plot revolves around the adventures of a young couple named laura and his grandfather
but it has all the elements and the movie that has a certain amount of humor
denzel washington is excellent as the troubled but loyal man who loves himself
and what is up with the story
ps i am a huge fan of movies that are supposed to be based on a book by david bradley
this film is a must see
perhaps that would be a lot better than it would have been but the acting and script were so bad that i could not stop laughing
it is a film about an ordinary young woman and the mother
there is a lot of action but it never really comes down to this
action packed comedy and a lot of fun
no doubt it was a good idea to get rid of the actors in this piece of junk
a lot of the scenes are pretty funny but the movie is so dull that it 's impossible to watch
jamaica inn was a very enjoyable movie with great acting from the entire cast
i was n't impressed at how this show was canceled
martha michelle gellar is a good actress
i 've seen a lot of bad movies
however this movie does have it 's flaws
this is a film that is not only one of those films i have n't seen
this film is a must see
i would n't be surprised if it was just a good idea to show a lot of things to do
i have seen it several times and have taped every time i watch it i can safely say it is a very funny movie to watch
when she is on the scene it 's hard to imagine how anyone would have had such a bad relationship with her
some of the dialogue and dialogue were pretty funny
interestingly the plot of the film is not a good one but the story is not as good as the original
the acting is superb and the characters all have their own personalities
a great film in all its glory
at the end of the day the movie was pretty much a carbon copy of the first movie
starting off as a comedy and as an action adventure i found it to be a very interesting and engaging film
yeah i know what i did last summer to celebrate my childhood and my classmates would n't even bother watching this
i saw this movie yesterday at the sundance film festival of rotterdam
and i did n't like this movie either
roughly the most important aspect of this movie is that they are all so obvious that they do n't have to be in a hurry
bette midler was in the movie as an adult she could have done with her character
maybe this is the first thing i 've read about the film in my mind
guess it is a good movie
anything else but the worst of the worst movies i 've ever seen
the movie is a little over the top but the way it does it is pretty cool and it is very realistic and is really fun
fast forward to the present point of view it is one big disappointment that is n't really a good thing
you 're not really a fan of the movie but you 'll probably enjoy it a lot
it 's a very interesting and enjoyable movie and a great film
he has done a good job of playing the main character with his character but that 's not the case with the other characters
then the story goes to get you to the edge
he also has a nice body
there is a very good reason to watch this but there is one very good performance of the entire film in a movie about a man trying to find a cure
not only is the movie pretty entertaining the actors are all very good in their roles
because i 've been a fan of horror films i have never seen such a bad movie in my life
this film was a very good movie
the film is a little too much and not too exciting
i do n't know who is the bad guy
it was not until the very end that the director of the film had no idea of the plot
so many people who have seen the movie and commented that this film is n't that bad it was a waste of time and money
if you 're a fan of the comic books you 'll be able to appreciate this movie
just as the movie is set out to be a little more fun than in a horror film
it is the best of the series
and the scene in which the girl is walking through a tree is a bit of a downer but a few minutes later the viewer sees the end of it coming and is a little bit shocked
is it a bad film or an interesting one
the plot and characters are so weak and so boring that i have to wonder how they could have been so much of it
not much else to recommend this film
of course it 's just a bunch of kids who do n't have sex and sex but that the kids are all too stupid for their own good
this movie is a complete bore
there 's a lot of good looking and nice things to be said here but the movie is just too bad for me to enjoy this movie
these are a few of the most important issues ever
i do n't remember seeing the movie
i saw this movie yesterday in a cinema
if the viewer is supposed to think that it would be a spoof of the film i 'd have to say i did n't want to be in the film
this is the best film of all time
i saw some of the actors and actresses of the film and i was able to find the acting in a very low key performance
also i was surprised when the film was released and the story was very interesting
i have never read a review that i 've ever seen but this is not a good movie
that said i did n't think that this was going to be a movie i would n't want to watch as i was so bored
here 's one thing i hate about a movie that was so bad it made me wonder what the point of the plot was supposed to be
however this was the most controversial and most chilling of the three
well this one is a good one
the movie is about as good as it gets and you can tell
the only good thing i can say about this is that it is not funny and it 's not funny it is not a movie or a movie
this is not the case the movie claims that there will be no plot or anything but the actors do n't have the same problems
narnia is a good movie and i do n't know if this is the first time i saw it
they are just so good and so real that we 're not just laughing at the movie in a way that is just annoying
in the end i think i 'll be watching the film and i will be able to see the movie again
we 're not sure who the culprit is who was responsible for this but that would not be it in the first place
a very good movie with the great acting and an excellent script
congrats to the director of this
in fact there are a few good moments
but there is also an interesting and very strong story that takes place in the past and is a very interesting experience
the acting was n't bad the acting was n't bad the effects were ok too bad the special effects were good
what is the point of having them do the petrol
you can read the book and you 'll have to see the film
anyway there is a very strong scene where he says that he has a gun in the wall and he 's just waiting for him to shoot
and the scene with the giant crabs that are so funny that you 'll laugh at the stupid jokes the whole time
and i did n't know it until the credits rolled
this is one of the few movies i have not seen i have seen
it 's a shame to see this film in a theater
mild spoilers for those of you who have n't seen this
it has an excellent cast and an amazing soundtrack
she is not a good actor
are they going for this one
not a single scene in the movie where they are talking about how it 's going to end
it 's a shame because the plot is n't that bad
while the movie is not about a man and his wife it 's an intimate film that is quite well acted and is not just about the family 's relationship
in the end the film becomes a very bad thing
there are so many of the things that are wrong with this film
on the other hand this is a pretty good film
fortunately he did not have a lot of work
as for the acting it 's a little too hard on this film
there was nothing original about it to be taken seriously
you can feel sorry for the people that have killed this film
could they make a sequel to the original and the film is a bit too much to be ashamed
the film is also the best of any type
poitier and his team members are all very funny and the film has some nice moments
michael dudikoff is great as an evil man
these are some of the most memorable movies i have ever seen
7 the movie is very well made
i have seen a lot of movies and this is one of those
if this is the best of the genre and the best of the series you can see this series
when it comes to movies i have n't seen a good movie but the one with the girl is so cute that it is funny
i do n't understand how this movie got made it was very good i thought the cast was pretty good
and if you can make a movie that is a bit of an insult to the book and the movie you will find it very interesting
it also has been a staple of mine since it has the same amount of humor but it is still a great movie
below the first two thirds of the film are quite interesting
did they really need to make this movie
some parts are a bit cheesy but it 's still a good family movie
i do n't know what the director was thinking but this was an absolute disaster in a way i was surprised that it was n't a sequel but the first one and the second
one of the most important aspects of this story
as with the original film it 's still not a masterpiece and the actors seem to be having some trouble with the film
what i did n't think was the acting and the story
she is a great actress and a great actress
stefan is a bit of a jerk but the real problem is the way the people he meets
rupert wood is excellent as well as the villain who has a great supporting cast
if you 're a fan of any of these films you 'll be disappointed to see them
that 's not to be expected with such a bad movie
defined by a group of friends who were sent to a mental ward of an underground village and an abandoned mother and a daughter in the house of the deceased 's daughter
so i guess the film does n't have the same budget as i did with its predecessor and a lot of other films that were so bad that i was just looking to find a copy for this movie
i do agree that they should have given the series more info but it is not
this is one of the few movies of the 80 's that are not a bad one
for a movie that is n't bad or at least not as bad as some of the others that have been made
i was surprised to see how much i enjoyed the movie
a lot of people have commented on this film that the movie is a little bit dated but it 's still very good
not much else happens and i did n't like it
these are the same things that happen in a different movie
it 's not a movie that i would watch as a child but rather a horror movie
what makes me want to know what happens to the girl and his daughter and their daughter and i think the main character is an idiot but that 's not saying much
they were not in the first movie but i did like them
it 's a shame that this movie was n't made available to me as a rental of the dvd
i was n't expecting it to be as bad as i had expected
the story is so predictable that i have to say it was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
that 's a great deal because of the fact that it is n't as good as it is but it is still a good movie
acting is ok and the characters and the movie really sucks
i was surprised to find that it was n't as good as the first one
certainly this was n't the first film to be released in the united states of the year
it seems to have been written by the same person as the da vinci code
the movie is a total insult to the intelligence of the director and the writer of a good idea
throughout this movie we are shown that the characters are not real and that is the main problem
does n't that make a film a good one
truly one of the best movies ever made in recent years and it certainly has some good ideas
there were so many things that could have made this film a little too long
i'm sorry but i would not have given it a higher score as it could be a little too bad
in fact i 've been looking for more of this movie since the first movie
because it was n't the first film that i saw in the theatres that were made by my friends
some of the acting is pretty good
it is n't even a comedy
nick nolte 's character is a bit dim but that 's why he 's a good guy
the acting is very poor the plot has the worst special effects a horrible cgi and some bad cgi scenes with an unconvincing script
by the way the characters are not developed
it 's a good family movie but the actors do n't make a good appearance
crumb 's character is the only real actor who is in the movie and does n't even care about the fact that he has a lot of talent in the script
for me it is the most memorable scene in film history and is beautifully shot in a beautiful and beautifully lit sequence where we are told about the world of the film industry of this film
having read the reviews here it is a very accurate representation of the film
the plot of this one is a joke but that 's all i got
ok so i was not expecting a lot from this film
unfortunately the story and characters are not very good
so if you do n't want to watch a movie i would advise this one and do n't waste your time
the plot is not a lot of things begin going down hill and it gets worse and worse
it is very hard to believe the movie was made in such a hurry to get the viewer into the movie because it is so boring and so predictable that i do n't even think of the possibility of the story
basically i would recommend the movie for a lot of laughs and the movie itself is n't that funny
yet i think the reason it gave this film more than 1 rating was because the story is so thin and full of holes and the acting is n't as good as the actors
soul is one of those films i would have loved to be able to watch it and i think it was worth the rental
to me this is a film about the lives of those who have been brainwashed and detained in a world of the very nature of the world to the fullest
the story line of the movie is a good one and a bit but there are some very few good moments in this film
whereas the story is not all that good it 's not the only good thing it 's about
i do n't know who the killer was but the film is so good to watch that it hurts its intelligence
i have seen many many other films and this is by far my favorite
this is not your usual hollywood film noir
one of the best things about this movie is that it is a complete departure from the original
i'm not one to watch this movie because i am a big fan of the original movie the movie is about as funny as it gets and it was good fun
bill nighy is the only one that is very good in this movie and it 's just that
the first part of the film is a bit confusing but the characters are so well written that i do n't care about them
but it 's the story of a group of men trying their best
it would make a lot of sense and would be a good film for those interested in the subject of the film but to have seen a few of those that have the patience to do the same thing and that is a great thing to say
one of my favorite films of all time
the acting was n't bad but at least the actors could n't save the show
part of the reason i wanted to give it a 2 is because i did n't see that the acting was terrible
drago 's character is not so much a character he 's supposed to be a hero but he does n't even have enough information about his own character
i do n't know if i 've been in a state of depression in any way
unfortunately the story is n't really that bad
i 've read that the film 's plot summary is about a woman 's life as a woman
i'm sure the filmmakers of the film did not have any of the money that could have been used as they have a lot of talent in this one but this was n't one of them
walk in and out of the theater and the two men
phantasm ii has some good action scenes
employing it for a few seconds
monster is the worst movie i have ever seen
carole lombard is a wonderful actress but she was just as good and the film as the one who was trying to be funny in this movie was not really a good one either
but i guess i can appreciate the story for it
as the film progresses he becomes an expert and one of his friends who are in charge of the town and their son
the only reason i can think of a movie about a film is because its a movie that 's so bad that it 's good to watch
a good idea of a film is to have a movie with a script that has no redeeming value
this film is a real gem
in the book the movie is about a young girl named sosuke who is in love with another girl and the woman
the story line is pretty good
there is a lot more to this movie than it should have been
electric arrow is a movie that should never be made and the only good thing about this movie is that it 's just a good movie and i really wanted to see a good movie
the story of what the media could have been done in this way is that they did n't have a clue about the origin of the characters
many of his later work is a bit of a mess as well and this is one of his best
well this movie is not about a guy trying to act like it was about to be a monster
the film is about an old black boy who is trying to get a job in the life of a young boy
the story is not bad but not a good one either
the film is a great piece of work and one of the best ever filmed
the plot is a little too easy to follow
following the plot of the first movie is a very interesting concept
it would have helped to keep the interest in the viewer 's interest
the only good thing about this movie is that the director did n't want to write a script like the movie
so if you like movies that are supposed to be funny or funny like i think you should watch this film
robert downey jr is good as the lead actor
good acting and great special effects
the story is a bit thin but it 's really really good for a comedy movie
so what if you were expecting to see a really bad movie
bridges is the only one who manages to get to the point that the entire audience can identify with his own character or the plot
a lot of people say i have no idea what this movie is about and i do n't know where to begin with the other reviews here
the film 's plot is pretty simple the plot is n't really that original and the characters are just a bunch of stereotypes
but if you want to see the worst film ever put in the history of the world and this movie is a must see
finally the ending of this movie is a real stinker
we get the idea that a man who 's toenails and his wife will be a little more than he bargained for
i was very disappointed with this movie
the plot twists and turns are just plain ridiculous
zac efron is a great actor
the movie starts when the young girl is kidnapped by the woman who killed her
may contain spoilers but that does n't matter
another thing that bothered me is the fact that it is a movie for all ages of a lifetime
i was n't really expecting much from the movie
however if you are looking for a good horror film this is a very well made movie
while there is n't enough action to keep the audience 's attention the movie is not as bad as some of the other movies from the same time but it does not really have much to offer
grease 's the first one is n't the best but i was impressed
the film is a very entertaining film
i have seen the movie a thousand times and i still have a lot of memories in this movie
i saw it at a screening of this film and i thought that it was a good one
we 're all about a very good story but we do n't really care about the characters and it 's too hard to care about the characters
i was a bit skeptical when he died
you know what i am talking about and the whole movie is set in a country
this film was a waste of money
affleck was the best i have come across
quickly she is a young actress who is very beautiful in the film
and the film is not for everyone
tony hawk 's pro skater 2x is a very interesting film
the movie is a complete waste of time but you will see it in your dvd player
i think the main problem with the film is the fact that it is not a film or a documentary or movie
and what 's with all the other reviewers
the film has an excellent supporting cast including john turturro and robert shaw
valiantly enough to get a grip in the end the end result is a complete mess
there 's nothing wrong with it
in my opinion this is the worst film i 've ever seen
in this case the characters are all onedimensional and uninteresting
a great deal of fun with the original
anita winger is a delight in this movie
dramacomedy 's not a problem as i said
this movie has been so many times that i do n't know what to say
was the story line so predictable that i had to wonder how it would end
fortunately he has a long lost wife and his father 's daughter who is also a lawyer who is a child and is n't the least bit emotionally disturbed
there are a few scenes that are so ridiculous they are funny
or maybe the director had some good acting ability to work with
his acting is pretty good the story is interesting but the acting and dialogue is very poor the script is awful and the characters are annoying
the first one is about the same old time and a lot of people in the film have no idea what they are doing
plus it was a good movie that was very well done and made me cry
although he did n't know what he was doing it would n't be too obvious that he had been in the film and the rest of the cast were all good
i was a kid at the time and i did n't know anything about the movie at all
boring is the case with the film
my wife and i had to laugh and laughed
charles durning is excellent in the role of a lifetime and his wife who is a bit too eager to be able to handle her
ok it 's a bit slow and it has no suspense
i saw it again in the theatre when i was in the theatre and was amazed to see it
based on a book by the great author of this movie the film 's title was published by one of the greatest american filmmakers of all time
so if you have nothing against the movie you will be disappointed
if the script is n't a joke it is the film 's best asset
it has a great cast and great actors
player and the beast is a very entertaining action film which will always make you cry
he is n't a great actor but a good actor
the acting is so horrible that you ca n't help but laugh for almost half an hour of the movie
i was expecting more from this movie because of the way that it was made
i was surprised when the movie was over
she was n't really the only good character in this movie
i 've never seen a movie that makes me want to know about the characters but i have to say that i am a big believer in the work of these two actors
especially since he has an obsession with a woman she adores and does n't want to be
in fact it is a very funny movie and a great time capsule
on the other hand i have to say i did n't enjoy the whole movie
the movie is a complete mess
if you want to see a good action flick go see this one
the film 's premise of the original was a very interesting one to watch
but the movie is a good example of this
peyton place is one of my favorites
but the story is very well developed and the characters are all believable
this is one of the few movies that i can remember watching and i still have a great deal of it
there is some good acting and the acting
series 1 i thought i was going to die
bother your eyes on a movie with your own brain
just the whole film is a mess
if you 're a fan of the original i think you will enjoy the movie
then you see that it is in the end and the end will be the most satisfying
otherwise i think it is a good family film
when i first saw it i was a little sceptical of it
elements of the show were not very interesting and it was not surprising that they were all very different
sheba is the one with a heart of gold and that 's why her mother died
for a movie that is not so much better than most movies i can say that i do n't have much to say about the film
another thing is that there are a few problems that make this film so much better than most of the other reviewers in the film
the movie was a bit long in parts and was not worth watching the whole time
dyan cannon is a good character and i liked her she was a nice choice for her
in the film he plays the part with the best in the film
the movie is very entertaining in its own right
do n't bother to watch the whole thing unless you 're in the mood for some serious horror
this is a movie you 'll enjoy
yes it 's like he 's trying to kill him
the film was a waste of time
the only real flaw is that there is n't a lot to recommend it
this film was a total waste of time
i am surprised how bad this movie is
the only thing that makes the film stand out is how the director was trying to make this film a little more realistic to the plot
there is nothing to be gained in this movie
one thing i did n't like was the scene with the guy playing her
the film does n't make much sense to us but rather a lot of action and suspense
times of course is a film that i can only imagine the reason that the movie was made for the us in the states of 1976 is that it was made with the same name as the first film in the series
george sanders does a good job as the lead character in the movie
the story is n't really all that good though it is n't the same as the book
there is a lot more to it than that
it 's the story of an older girl who has been kidnapped with some sexual outcast and her son who 's been kidnapped by the death of a girl and her sister is murdered as the daughter who is also the daughter of the mother
ring 0 is the worst show ever i mean the series has to be the worst ever to have ever aired it 's just a little too bad that they are n't afraid to make a remake
it is n't a good movie but it is still a great movie
this film is about the life of two people living in a house and their lives together with a bunch of people
the only way to make this movie was the fact that this movie has a lot of potential
the film is a complete failure to sit through
a few of the scenes that make it stand out are the performances of the characters that are very convincing
but the film itself is a little slow at times and there is some very poor acting
the film 's plot is so weak and contrived it is impossible to understand any of the characters in it
the only good thing i found was that this movie was made for television
i saw this movie yesterday when it came out in 1990 i had a good idea about it
atrocities arise and are left to fend for themselves
it is n't a very bad movie
it is a story of a young man who finds himself in the world of an evil and fulfilling world and is able to cope with his feelings and weaknesses
pitch black is a film where all the actors are excellent
bring the film to an end where the viewer has no choice
i am so glad that you have to watch it to see what it was like to be on
another great scene in particular was the scene where she sings a song of a song called 'she and the song in the movie which was very good i was very excited
not only is the story of a family man 's life in the middle east the two main characters and their relationship are very believable and the movie has its moments
magnolia has been done better and better as the story to the series
ok this movie really was n't the best i 've seen
this is one of my favorite comedies
graphics are n't as good as the first film but it 's just a bit of a letdown
in the end the story is very simple
i think i 'll get the movie out for a few quid and it 'll be worth
4 it does not make sense
capone 's wife is a bit of a tomboy she is an object of sexual desire to be treated as an outcast and the mother of the family is very good in the role of the woman who she is not in this film
one wonders what a good movie this was
and that 's all i can say about this film
this one was a waste for the first half of the movie
dahmer is a very very bad guy who is n't a very good person
this is a great movie and a good time capsule
on the other hand it is a very good film that will be seen by everyone who likes to see a movie with the kind of thing that is n't a real life in the world but still in some way or another in the world
there 's a lot of sex in the movie but that 's just a minor complaint
for the record the best thing about the movie is that it is the first one to be so utterly bad
the story of the kelly family is a very interesting one which is very refreshing
this is a must have for a few laughs
great story lines that i do n't know
patrick warburton does a good job playing the villain but this movie just did n't work
susannah york 's character is a little too cocky to be too sympathetic but in reality he was just too sweet for the material
he has no idea what 's going on in a world of people who have the power to be in the process
freezing is not a bad show as it is a little more interesting than most of the series
the movie starts off with a couple of friends in the woods
the only redeeming factor i have are the fact that the movie is a bit slow and drags over the head
and i 've heard that it 's all a little too bad to be in the world that this movie is made
i would not call it a film if the film is in a way that makes you want to be entertained by the end of it
as the story progresses it 's easy to understand why he is given the money and that his wife has not even a son
american graffiti is one of the best
it 's the first movie i have seen for a long long time
this film could have been a lot more interesting and interesting if not better than it would have
the acting is terrible and the acting is worse and the script is so bad that you ca n't help but laugh
both of these characters are a real hoot
two things are so far more entertaining than that
i think the movie was just bad and the worst part of the movie was when it got me to see the film and i think they had a lot better to work with
it is an interesting film and it has a great cast and the actors are wonderful especially from the leads in the supporting roles
also i did n't see a lot of scenes of the film
it 's a great film and a great film
ben murphy was great as always and i really liked him
this is not a bad movie but it is very well worth a watch
it has a good plot a little action and a few laughs but i ca n't think of any other film that actually made it to the cinema
i 've always been a fan of the show
this was a really good movie
series 4 is a complete waste of time
now this is what it is a great film that should have been called a cult classic
the only thing this film has to offer is it
had the movie gone to the toilet for the most part it would have been a good movie
there 's a reason for this movie to be released in the us in the us
this is one of the worst movies of the past decade
i do n't see what it does n't have
i think that was an interesting idea for a movie
terrifying but not as good as its predecessor
this movie makes me feel that i have a fondness for a movie like this
mainly it is a great performance and that 's why i have to watch it to find out what the point is it just does n't seem to work on
do yourself a favor and watch this
i was n't sure who this movie was but this was the best thing about it
hardly any of the jokes were funny
he 's the best actor on the show
well i was n't sure what it was supposed to be about
they do n't know what to expect and that does n't matter
it 's a shame that the movie has n't been released on dvd or vhs release
the film is about a man who has a dream of being killed by the death of a serial killer who is now a vampire
he 's just not believable but he has done a good job
i was n't really sure what to expect and i was n't impressed with the ending
and it 's a shame that the director never made it to the end so i can understand the story
so it is a movie that you will find yourself laughing and cry and cry
the script is n't too bad and the characters are stupid
it 's not a film that is so bad you 'll just leave it to yourself
no one has ever said anything
the story is a bit confusing but it 's really interesting and the acting is excellent
although this is a good show it 's not a great movie
i do n't know how this film has received a theatrical release release but it is still very good and i will give you one good review for the film
i have seen a lot of movies but i was impressed that this movie did n't work for me
he 's a little too young to make this movie
what is with the poor slob trying to be hip and failing miserably
their chemistry was a little overdone but the movie is n't just as good as the others it is
now the plot is a bit thin and i do n't care for the fact that there are too many things wrong with this film
she 's a great singer and is very likable in the film
but then the movie is about two men who live for a night of each other
i have n't even read the book and seen it in the theater
she 's not even that much more attractive than in a movie she 's a good actress
i have n't read the book and i have never read the book
i think he 's the greatest in the world but i do n't want to talk about that
if you have not seen this movie it is not for you
if you are a teenager and like to see an older man 's life you will be disappointed
a good movie that is n't even worth a watch for those who do not
i think that the film would have to be a better choice for a film to work out as i have a few friends that are n't too fond of it
although the movie is n't about the story of the killer the movie is n't bad enough to make a movie
was there anything more exciting than a little furry that was the first
for the record i would recommend this movie to any fan of horror movies
gargoyles were not a lot of people
in fact the entire film was made for a little less than a few bucks
the film is a real masterpiece
fortunately i did n't have much to say about the story and that 's what i got
every single person was just stupid and stupid
i 've always felt a little bit of the same
when the story is about an american couple who have to fight against the enemy of the japanese civil war and the germans in the us the movie is based on a true story of two soldiers who fought through a german war and the japanese war
the movie 's title suggests a lot of things and that is not what i 'd expect
it was like that the story was about a young kid who has been abused and murdered by a man in a suit
there 's not even a scene where one of the actors is reciting their lines
ricco was a real person with a few problems with the world
but if you have the patience and respect to you then you 'll find yourself in your seat
as far as i can tell there is a bit too much to say about this film that makes it a very bad movie
the acting is very good for the most part
update of the book is a good idea for a movie
the story is pretty good and there are plenty of laughs in this movie
is he just a guy with the golden arm of a man in the basement
something that is not the worst movie i have ever seen
i do n't know how it could have lasted for a long time but it is a good film to watch and i have to say the movie is a little more interesting and more exciting than it actually is
the movie also suffers from being boring at times but i did n't expect that it is a movie
the script was n't even funny
the film has some great moments
when the movie ends we get the impression that the director is trying to make it a little longer and it does
at first it seemed like he was in a trance
so i have the dvd of this one
spiderman is a very good film that is n't afraid of the classic it has a good story
playing a role in this movie is a little jarring
the movie is n't as great
pretty much all the actors are doing the right thing
what a load and the whole thing was just an excuse to show the worst thing about it in my life
one can see the potential of the actors as the characters and the plot lines are very good but the acting is n't really good the actors are n't particularly attractive and the story is a bit too weak for the genre
the film is also filled with flashbacks of a lot of the characters in the movie
i was n't disappointed by the fact that i was watching a movie for the first time and i thought it was going to be bad
we 're also given the reason why she does the best she can with the character
notwithstanding that it 's a very bad film i think the worst acting job was the one with the bad guys that were not bad at all
it has been a lot more difficult since this movie 's release
there is also the fact that this is the story of a young and young girl who is sent by a child to her mother to find her
i 've been watching the movie for years and it 's just a shame that this movie is n't available in dvd
rarely do i feel that i wasted my time with the film
the first thing is that the movie is so bad that it is actually a shame to see this movie
represented by the film 's most famous cast of performers and actresses in this film the film is a very good film
in fact it was the first movie i saw i was impressed
when you watch it i think i will have the right to see it again and it was the first time the first episode aired
the only thing that kept me from giving this a 7 is the fact that it was shot by the same person who did n't know that the film was a complete waste of time
however the movie was n't that good either
everyone else is just not funny
the film also features several fine actors
the script is not bad but the acting is terrible
this movie is one of the best and i have to say it is a great film and i recommend the movie to anyone who has seen a few movies that have a strong cast
the first film is a masterpiece of cinematic brilliance
young women in the cast include some of the most memorable and funniest actors ever
hector elizondo and david morse have done a good job
i was a kid in the seventies and early 90s and this was not the case with the show
the film is also a bit boring in places but the story is so simple it makes the characters all believable
but this one is a real stinker
my favorite movie in the world is the love story
things get going downhill and they do n't get a clue
it is n't so bad it 's bad
overall the movie was pretty entertaining and i liked this movie
although i am not a fan of this genre the film has some of the most impressive characters ever put into the screen and i have to admit i enjoyed this movie
he had a very funny scene when a woman was on the phone with the camera and he was n't the person of the movie
the film does n't have much to offer but the film itself is very good
one thing that makes this film watchable is that it is a film that has the ability and attention to detail and it is a real treat for all of us and for those of us that are not fans of musicals
throw the two together to make a coherent movie
when it was released i thought it was an ok movie
i would have been happy to see him in a more serious role and he was better at being good
the movie has some of the best actors you 'll ever see in the movie
especially for the first half hour or so the story is told through the movie
one thing about the movie i found was the fact that the main characters in this movie were so bad they 're so stupid they just have no place in the movie
the movie is a great piece of work that should be required viewing to be seen
scene with the young woman and her brother
the only redeeming feature in this otherwise awful film is that it has the same plot and the same actors as the original
i have seen this movie and it 's not the least bit exciting i 've had
i have to say that the whole plot was just a bit of a joke
a very interesting and funny film about the consequences of a young man 's life
later on we are left to ponder about the plot
certainly it is one of the most memorable films i have ever seen
this is one of the funniest and most memorable movies of the 90 's
not only is it a very bad movie and i do n't think it should have been made
not much of it is good to begin with but the fact that this film is a real treat to watch and i ca n't imagine how it can get even worse
malevolent violence is what it 's supposed to be
horrible acting bad direction and a very bad script
there is a scene that will haunt you to watch and listen to the music
this movie is one of the worst ever
after the opening scenes where the two guys are killed the two men start investigating the crime of the two lovers that they are in love
woody harrelson is perfect as the young cop
this is a movie that has the same director 's own agenda
i 've always found this film to be a bit slow
on the other hand i think that it 's just a shame
this is a pretty good family film which is the best way to view it
i have to agree with some of the other comments here
crime is a very good thing
the acting is terrible the characters are boring and the script is just stupid
mr and mrs and his wife ellen are having sex with the mother
there 's not one single memorable character in this movie
the story line is very similar with the original one
but the film was not so much better than the original
gangster films are n't a bad thing
he has to have to fight for the entire life with all his friends
added to the movie 's plot the movie is a bore
saying this is a great movie for me
i do n't think this is true
jean gabin is a very talented actor and is also excellent as well
and what a shame it did n't work as a comedy or as a comedy
an excellent film by a very gifted director
then there 's the fact that the film is set in a city where it looks like the actors were trying too hard to be too hard
patrick mcgoohan is a genius in his first feature film
the film is set in a very small town in new zealand where the movie is about the same thing as this movie
in a way you 'll never be bored
was it supposed to be funny and failed miserably
then the movie is not really about a group of friends
like most movies i have seen lately the movie was very very much a remake of the first
i saw this as a comedy and it is n't as much of a shock as it 's a fun and entertaining movie
some of my friends have to see this
florida is a film with a great message that the director had been able to pull out of
1 the ending in a warehouse is very good as we get to see some very interesting images and some of these people do n't seem to have seen the film
not the best of these films
together the film is a bit more than a series of sketches that make you feel the characters are not fully developed
i think it was a very good movie
i do n't know if this is the same thing i did but it 's not as bad as i had expected
theirs 's first movie of a story is that it 's an interesting concept of a story that has a few twists thrown in and a few twists and turns in their respective personalities and the plot twist
the plot is so simple that it becomes almost unbearable and the characters themselves are not developed in this movie
kpax is a very interesting movie with a great cast
the movie has an excellent cast and an excellent script
the only reason i gave this film 1 out of 10 is because there are so many good actors out there that have not been able to get to the end of this movie
it was a little bit of a stretch to sit through
the film does n't have a clue
and there is nothing to do with a story like this
lame and stupid it makes a whole lot of fun and the story has its moments but there is nothing original
i'm glad i did n't get it and if it did i could n't
if you 're looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat this is a must watch
because of the lack of the most compelling story i 've seen i found myself unable to suspend interest to see it and it was a good one to watch
i'm surprised that they did not even bother renting this film
i have been a huge fan of the original series
in my opinion the best movie of the year was borat
as for the movie i was surprised by the fact that it was so bad
the film is set in the present day and the story is set in a small town in the united states
i saw the movie and i thought it was the funniest of its genre
i saw this film on a flight in the middle of the night
yes they have to have a good movie about what they were but not the ones who had to make
this is one of my top ten favorite shows
while this film lacks the essential elements of the book it has to be the first
this movie is not about the evils of human values
spent a lot of money at the local video store for the rental fee
combined with the fact that the story is about two sisters who have an accident to each other they can live together
no one is a good person who does not like it but he 's a very nice guy and a very nice guy with a lot of fun
he is a very talented director
low budget and not an oscar winner
a movie that should have been a success
but the real question is who 's to say about the plot
whether the film is really about the real events of the film it was a very good idea to make an engaging film but the film was not a total success
normally this is a good show but that 's not something i can think of
in this movie he gets in the right direction of the first film and is really the best of the lot
of course they 're not the only ones who are able to make them so miserable
without any of the characters and the plot it 's pretty much an improvement and the actors do n't really have any of what 's going on and the plot seems a tad too thin to be taken seriously
a film of the sort with a great cast
it 's a shame that a movie like this could have made this movie to be an indication of the real story
it 's a very simple and interesting film
it 's a pity that this film never made any of the movies that were shown in the first place
one of the best films i have seen in years
is it a good film or a good idea for a good movie
bottom line this is a great film for all ages
and that is where it ends
anyone who has seen the original or the first series will find this show to be a complete waste of time to sit through
i have n't seen it since i first saw it at age 14 i was n't a huge fan of hers
in my opinion this movie is one of the worst movies ever made
either the writer or the writers forgot that the film was not the best
she 's the best character i have ever seen on tv
for those who think the world will be a good film this movie is just another
i think that is what the movie is trying to say
do n't waste your time with it
there 's a lot of the movie 's atmosphere and the characters are n't very good and i do n't think it was a waste of time
if i were to make a choice for a movie that would be made for the people involved i should have done something better
i have never seen a better film like this before
set against a background on the first film in the first place it was a very good film
where are the black and white cars
there is a lot of action and the story is very good and the story is so real and interesting
it would be a shame that the movie did n't get a wider release on the public
while the story is somewhat similar it 's a good movie
stripperella 's direction is superb as well
why did they do so many movies that have a lot of good ones
i was surprised by what the other side of his face would be like to me that the movie was a little too much like a film noir
i have to admit to that this is the worst film i 've ever watched the fact that it is a movie is not an understatement it is a total waste of time
there 's no need to see it and you will not regret it
harry is also the best of the bunch and he makes it hard to see why the movie is so good that it is just another bad movie
sandra bernhard plays her role as the title character
the plot is pretty good and the story is pretty interesting but that 's about it
as for the other actors they are not even funny
a very enjoyable scene and a very nice film
although the movie was obviously intended to appeal to a younger audience it still has an impact and the result is an enjoyable film
this time it 's not just a movie about a bunch of teens and the boys who get involved with the local mob
a lot of this is n't a movie
quite possibly the best part of the series
the only good scene involves the one where the girl and her sister get the girl to work with her and then they have a conversation with the guy who is the one who killed her and the guy who has to go for him
if you are into this kind of movies you 'll be surprised at how bad this show is but if you 're not a good movie buff you 'll like this one
then i saw this movie in the theater
and the film was shot with a camera
he has to be one of those who have a lot of fun and his own voice is not the only person in it to get the chance to see this film
that 's why the film is so bad as to be laughable in many aspects
the plot is pretty simple and the acting is good
the movie also features interviews with other people who were very familiar with the story as well
some of the scenes were just stupid
for a start this was a really great and funny movie
this film could have been so much better
although i can only assume that the movie was made on a shoestring budget it is still very good
pretty much the whole movie is so predictable and predictable
however the film was n't bad
margaret reid is the daughter of the two musketeers who are in this movie
matters of the story are that they are n't even good but it 's a great little movie
comments that are so bad that the audience can barely believe the difference between these two films
the film has the usual clichs of a bad movie
with the exception of the movie it 's a movie that is n't worth a watch
i do n't know why this film was made
which is the problem of the movie
he plays a character in a series of flashbacks and is also the same character that he played on
max is a good actor but he is the only one who can act
but the story is so predictable that it 's just too dull
imagine the movie in a way that is a bit of a shock and not to mention
maybe it 's a spoof of the book
and then the story turns out to be a little boring and pointless
and i think the whole thing is a very bad movie
lots of action and suspense and a lot more action
bloody movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever but the director does it a disservice to his work
and the ending was so bad that i was n't able to sit through
everybody who has the right idea for a story and a story should see a bunch of kids in the same place
for those who love movies and the movies they 're made to do so this is one that you wo n't forget but you wo n't care
file out the good ole' days of your life
watching it i did not care what happens to it
an old man has a small part in this movie
the plot is a bit of the spoof
throughout this movie i had a good idea of how the movie could have been so good to the point where i could n't even tell whether or not it could have been made in such a way
the acting is very good and i thought it might be a good idea to see the film
already i have no idea what it is and why but this is a good movie
all in all a very entertaining show
the film is not about the characters that were in their own way
it 's not the same movie it 's just not a horror flick
i do n't remember any vividly and i just could n't get over the fact that it was a movie about a young boy who is a teenager and he has to be a woman with a boyfriend who has to go into his home and get his own life
this is a very bad show and that makes no sense whatsoever
plus in my view that the film is n't bad but not the worst of this bunch
for the first half of this movie you know that it is not a good idea to watch a movie and a good story
the plot was a little confusing but i liked the acting in the first half
this is a movie that i would definitely recommend it as it has a very strong cast but also some excellent actors
other than that this is a movie worth seeing
instead of the typical suspects the story is told by an interesting plot and the actors are all very good and the actors are good but they do their usual work
the movie is also about a very young girl whose daughter is killed in a car accident
they should have made this a movie instead of the usual hollywood fluff and they would have made it better
even though i 've read the book a few times i have not yet read the book so much so i have to give it a 1
cue the first movie and that 's about all you need to know
i'm not sure how this movie will be in the theaters
how did he ever get the funding for the credits
the film 's premise is a little confusing but it 's a bit of a stretch for the audience to find
i 've read many of the other comments here about this film which i did not understand
it 's not a great movie
after that it 's the only reason why you would want your time back
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
in fact the only person who has any knowledge of this movie is a very very bad guy
in fact the movie is a bit of a bore
grace 's acting is so good that i ca n't imagine any of it
at least they had the decency to make this a bit more of a mess
keep it in mind this has a lot of potential and you can tell that this is n't an action movie
he has a good sense of humor and has a good voice that has been delivered with a lot of great subtlety
i am not a fan of the genre but that 's all i can really say is that i am glad i did n't pay for it
stan is a great actor but the story is just too weak and too stupid
stick up and take the time to see again
i 've watched it countless times and it will always be my cup of tea
eighteen months later she was the one and only known to be one of my favorite movies in the same year as the girl that made her famous as the woman
give this movie a chance and you 'll have to be a fan of the original
nobody else has a chance to get a good laugh when he 's trying to get into a movie like the ones who are n't in the movie
this movie is so bad it 's good
he is not a good person to say the least
so why was it so bad
jaspers is a man who 's not a very ordinary father and a very funny person
it 's just that there 's no excuse at all to make the movie interesting
does this have to be the best
rotor is a really great show
the plot is so thin i could n't care less about the characters
so why does he do it
what 's even more striking is his performance in a film
a good cast of characters who are in a different place and the plot lines are really well developed
somehow the movie has a good message about it and the movie does n't seem to be that much of a problem
his role is very well played and the character is a perfect fit for the role of an aging young man
sophia myles as usual is also a bit too much but she does n't play the role she 's been in
although this movie is not a complete waste of time
i was surprised at how much of it was made in the first place
for the first time i saw a lot of other movies and i have seen some of them
i have to say this show is a complete disgrace
can he find out he 's an expert
jet li is an actor who can pull off the most convincing and entertaining roles of his career
christina and the girl of the house are the ones who have a relationship with him which is a bit of a mystery
and then there is the fact that the director is the one to tell us that he is a real person
now it seems that the film is a very good idea to be charitable but it fails to entertain us
this movie could have been a much better movie and should have been left out
this is one of the worst films i have ever seen
flesh and geeks have some good points but they do n't have enough time to make it good
the only thing that really annoyed me was that the story of the movie was n't as funny as i expected
did i mention that the film was shot in the united states
i have to admit it is one of the worst films ever made i 've seen
we know that the movie has been a success for the big screen
for instance the scene where the hero is trying to kill her in the car is a highlight of a movie
in fact this is a very good movie and i highly recommend it
and then they go out of the way to try to get the money back and go on
his performance in this film was very strong although his role as the character was very believable and it had a lot of depth
i would n't be surprised if it had been more a remake of it
it 's a shame the movie has such a good name
although the plot is not a bit predictable it does n't make a lot of sense
in fact the only thing missing was the fact that there was a huge amount of action in the plot
well if there 's a flaw in it why is the film so powerful and so funny
the first is that it 's a good movie but not as bad as in the other
i have been looking for it on dvd for over a year and still have n't watched it in the theater
fortunately they were not even funny
in my opinion this movie is one of the best i have ever seen
i 've always thought of watching this movie
this is a very interesting film about a very rich subject matter
in fact it was a great experience
the movie was n't bad but i was n't expecting much from the movie
but it is the only thing that can be said for this film
absolute beginners is one of the best of the lot
also in my opinion the movie was a bit boring but in the end it is just a great film which is the best i can remember from this movie
or even the slightest of the story and the characters in the film
karishma kapoor is a wonderful actress
so why would they put such a good idea
god knows how to describe the plot
but that 's just a bad thing
so it 's not a bad movie it 's not even that bad
edie falco does a fantastic job as the mother and sister and i was a little surprised by the movie
i think the reason i watched this movie is because there 's not a single drop of it on the tube
i do n't think it was a very good movie and it was the only one to get to the point
i think they are the best actors ever
the film opens with the two young lovers of the first one who have to fight for themselves
it is a good film but not for a lot of laughs and the acting
bozo and his buddies are the same as the old friend and a man with a heart
in a sense of reality this was one of those films where the viewer was n't laughing at what it was meant to be or what it was supposed to be
this movie is a total waste of time
this film is not the best example of a film that i 'd watch
acts like an escapee from a bad movie but the rest of the cast is very good with their characters and the direction of the story and the way it is presented in the movie
but the best part of the movie are the scenes in which the movie is shot and it 's not just the music that it 's a big problem because that is the only thing that i can say
pontiac a bit of the movie that is the weakest thing in the entire movie
what i found amazing is how many films that go downhill over the years of this movie
the first half of the movie is just a little bit too much like i expected a little more
the plot is simple and the acting is pretty good too
i saw this movie when it was released
caroline clayburgh gives an excellent performance as the mother
her character is a bit dim and the movie is just too boring to be funny
its the kind of movie you should not watch it
i have to admit to all that it is a great film with a few laughs
she was so beautiful and so beautiful and so sexy and so cute
those who have been in the cinema business are a little more forgiving of themselves than those of the old hollywood movies
there are no other scenes in the movie where you do n't really care about any of them
but this film is so utterly awful that it is n't funny
several times in the movie i was a bit prejudiced that the story was so bad but the movie was so bad that you could n't even laugh at it
not a good one for me to like
at least he does n't want to get his hands on a woman to be in the middle but it 's not that he does n't have a chance to be in this film and that is the only reason he should have had this character 's name and a character who could n't have come up in the movie as well
unknowingly i was surprised at what it was supposed to be about and the plot was just a tad too long and unnecessary and the story was so weak and contrived
i think this film is a very poor attempt at trying to make it to the world of the greatest horror movie ever made
kinda bad for me it is a movie that is worth watching for the performance of the actress
then we see the first two and it seems to me that they are going to be a bit different and they just did that
i 've never seen such a film so far and that it is n't a total waste
playing a role of this film is the main reason why i have a problem with this movie
robert culp is excellent as the lead
our heroes were n't even good enough for their children
number one is one of the best films to come out of the late 60s and 90s as a comedy and as a vehicle for the genre
small town is a wonderful movie
there are a few twists in the film which are not even funny
sorry folks this movie is bad
kick the hell out of me
i 've been in a coma for a few years so i can see the same thing in the same breath
they are so good that you can barely help but laugh
i'm not even going to get the movie out of the box
intentionally it is a film of a young man 's life as a man with his wife
the story line is so simple that it becomes almost impossible to accept that it 's not the same
don cheadle as the chief villain is the only character who seems to be able to identify with one 's life and he is a bit of an actor and is very funny to watch
and the acting is n't bad
this is a very funny movie with an allstar cast including a wonderful and excellent performance by james earl jones a wonderful actor who has no acting skills whatsoever
but this is one to avoid at all costs
it has some of the best dialogue i have ever heard
or maybe it is not the movie that made it so good
seems to have been made by the same director to the next movie
finding the real meaning and the fact that there is nothing in the way of plot or tension that makes it worth it all
i was a little worried about this movie but this movie is so bad it 's good'
i 've been in many of the other films of the past and this is one of them
the acting is so terrible that they do n't even come close to being good
it is very easy to find fault
he is a good actor who does n't have any range of talent
as for the acting the acting the script and its overall plot is not even good
until now that is n't the case
whatever it takes on this is n't a good thing as a movie
putney swope is a great movie
this time it 's all so bad and so lame
all in all i think it should be more like a movie of the week and it is n't
like a film i did not like it
much like the rest of the movie is a bit of a joke to watch
i do n't think it is that easy to make a movie about the subject
i saw the movie in a preview of it on cable tv at the seattle tv station
if you 're looking for a good laugh this is the movie for you
one of the few things that makes the original version of this movie is the soundtrack
i was surprised by how bad this film was
this film makes the viewer feel uneasy and emotionally disturbed
i think it 's unfair that this film was released theatrically and it was a complete failure to see what it was like in the early 80s and early 70s
i do n't think this movie has a lot of potential
it 's all very well constructed well done and well paced
the acting is superb the writing is excellent the direction is beautiful the cinematography is great all the actors are perfect
coincidence and the other characters are the same as in other films but this is a pretty good movie
okay it 's like it is n't a movie
they are both very very interesting and the story line is good
i was n't expecting a lot to be entertained but i did not like the movie
anarchist duck is not the best movie that i have ever seen but i have read it
charlize theron has a very small role in this movie
michael keaton was good as the bad guy who has a lot of problems but he 's a bit over his head
as for the plot it 's not that bad
it 's like a bad tv show
the film is a little slow at best
i do n't remember seeing the first one but i do n't think the film could have been a much better
i was n't impressed with the fact that this movie was shot by the same person as the other one in that it 's a film that 's really bad
the movie is about a man who is accused of his family
phony characters in the first one are so stupid you wonder how they could get away on their own lives
even if it 's not the worst film i 've ever seen it makes me think that the filmmakers of the movie were trying to find something that could n't be so bad
i have seen the same old crap from a different director
he is a man with no talent and is a very talented actor
like a lot of other movies i think i 've watched it twice
its just as bad as it is
it 's a good thing to make a movie like this
we 're not supposed to be happy
usually the movie is very bad
a lot of it seems to be filmed with a little more imagination and some really interesting camera work that could have been used but this movie is really really good
subplots are introduced as a bit of the plot to make a story about a young man who has a secret to live a life of crime
alonzo and lombard are both terrific and the movie is a mustsee for all ages
landau 's role is the same as the main character
here is the movie that i did n't know existed in my review for the first 15 years but it turned out to be very disappointing
movies like this are always funny
the story revolves around a young boy who is trying to get his family back in the past and his hometown
however the only thing that kept me watching was when they were making a movie about their own
i 've seen some really awful movies
this is a movie that will be seen again by everyone you will ever watch
it is a very good film with excellent acting and great actors
once i saw the film i knew of this and i would n't say that there 's a lot of gore
the only reason i gave this movie a 1 is that it was n't a good one at all
so i was surprised by what the critics did to this movie
this is a movie that should be viewed by everyone who watches a film or an action film
it is an insult to the film
although the movie is based on a true story it is also the first time i see the film i will never forget it and that i would have to agree with the other user comments
glass is one of the most interesting and interesting portrayals of the world in the world
the only redeeming features for me is the scene in which the girl and the guy are chasing a woman in front of a car which i thought would be funny
all the characters are well portrayed and it seems the movie is n't about the same kind of character as the other two but it is still an interesting movie
the story is not very well developed but the movie does n't take itself seriously
this is the worst movie of 2005
just as the movie goes on its head the characters are very believable and it is interesting to see them
that 's why i have to admit i am not going to see anything in this
you 're not really a big fan of the genre
mike binder 's direction is a bit dated
in addition to this one the story is very weak
but i did n't have to pay much attention to the film because it had so many plot holes that i did n't even care about any of the characters
farley was a pretty good choice for this
special effects are a lot more effective
not only did it make sense but also the story and the acting was great
jimmy swayze and david lynch have done a fantastic job with their material of the movie
the acting is so bad i ca n't believe any of this movie
being a fan of a classic horror flick i was very disappointed in this one and that was the point
bottom line it 's a bad movie
in fact the movie is so boring that it 's hard to believe that the director actually cared about the characters in the end
first of all the acting of all the actors were horrible
his wife is a little too infatuated with the marriage between the two
this one really should have been more enjoyable and had more to do with the original cast the first time around and they should be ashamed of themselves and to be a part of the cast
the only redeeming feature of this film is its lack of originality
join the parents with the assistance of her father 's mother who has to cope with her son the young daughter who has been murdered by her mother
risque is a movie that has the potential to be a comedy but it is not
the plot is n't too original
the movie is about a family who is a family of the family and a group of young boys in town trying to find each other and find themselves in trouble with each other
flaws are not always the most important part of the film
one day a woman who is engaged to the daughter has become a little too old for her
i do n't even want to give away the ending of the movie
it was so bad it was embarrassing
i 've never been a fan of his other work and i am a fan of his films but i did n't like it
just do n't expect to see any of it
none of the jokes are funny
it 's the story of a family of people who have a relationship
apparently it 's supposed to be a comedy but the jokes and gags were lame
though the film is a bit long and the acting is quite good it still stands out as a very good movie
okay it was n't that bad
the movie is also a bit slow paced and not a bad thing that is just plain dull
also it is an interesting movie
never once did this movie suck
for those who have seen it i would recommend this as a great movie
almost all of this was the best movie
and the whole film is about a girl named caroline who goes to a house in the woods in a small village where she is a witch and she is a witch with a heart and soul
anyway i 've seen it all my life and i think it 's a good movie
if you have n't seen this movie you 're not going to see it
and the movie was just so stupid
1 i have to say this movie really sucked me into it
so i was expecting that to go with it
there 's a bit of a plot to it which has been added by some of the same characters but this is one of the many movies i had seen in the us which was a good one
yet it 's a good film to see and the film does a fine job of showing how the life of war is
the script is very clever and very interesting
by now that is one of the things that make this so bad and why this is one of the worst films i 've seen to date and that 's why i watched it
spoilers ahead of the first movie you get the impression that the filmmakers had the intention of trying to make a movie that was not funny
by the end of the movie there 's a scene where one of the girls gets killed in the beginning
sadly the script was so bad that even i could n't care less about the characters
and it was not that i do n't think it 's supposed to be
sorry to see the movie is a complete mess
in fact i would n't have been surprised
specialeffects are not bad and the script does n't seem to work
aging and i love this film
if i were on the lookout for the dvd i would n't have had the slightest interest to be a better actress
it 's a shame that the film 's release of releasing it has the dvd release of the book the first film in its release
the script was horrible the characters were shallow and the whole thing was so bad
then there are some good examples of the film which is not a big deal but they have a great deal of chemistry
i saw it at the sundance film festival in washington dc and i thought it was a little too long but the first time it got on my nerves
all of the actors are all very bad
just like most of these people and the other movies of this genre the characters and the plot are all very good
this is n't a great movie
anna paquin is the only one who can act as a young woman and she 's very sexy as the girl
angrily the story begins with an uneasy man who is a little too eager to save the life he has
the film was shot during the war scenes and the lighting was so bad it could be considered a distraction but the film is n't that bad and the director was just trying to get some kind of a good movie
yeah it 's a bad movie but it 's really hard to make a decent movie that is good in some ways
not only that they were all the same characters and the movie was just plain stupid
this movie had a great cast including michael madsen and james earl jones in this film i have a feeling of the same director who was in a film with a cast that has no real talent but a movie
it 's the best way to view an anime film
one of my all time favorites
about the only thing good about it is the scenery
there are some funny moments in the movie and that 's what the story is
a few things i found interesting but this is not the movie
in fact it was a complete disappointment
this is not a good movie
from the very beginning of the movie we see the same man who is supposed to be in his house and a few of the other members of the family
as i said the only good thing i could say about it was the fact that the story was so good and the acting was good
this is a very funny movie
i was so excited to see it on a whim that i was expecting more than i thought would possibly be an accurate film
everyone in the movie is a complete caricature with the exception of the original
first of all it seems that the director is trying to make a movie with a very low budget
the film has a great cast including james caan and the great lon chaney jr and his acting as a villain is priceless but the rest of the cast is not very good
perhaps it was because of the director 's intent to show that it is just a little bit different
he has no idea of how to use the word fck to express how he feels
her performance in the film is quite good and it 's quite a shame she does n't have to be the best actress to come to the screen
why would he have to make this
i think the film is very well made
the film has no sense of urgency whatsoever
i do not remember how the story was so boring i did not think it was a comedy
the film is a little dated
i do n't know who this movie really is and that does n't work
this film is the first of two films i saw in my lifetime
it does n't matter whether the movie is being a comedy or a drama but a comedy about love and relationships between two men in an extraordinary setting
and the scene where he has a gun and the two guys are sitting in their seats while he tries to save the world
gary oldman is the most convincing character in the film and he is also a joy as he does
the acting is horrible from everyone involved except to watch this film
well the plot is n't a total loss of the plot but it 's not really a comedy or a good one
sure it does n't have to be that bad but it is still a good little movie
first off i'm not going to say anything about this movie
this movie is one of the best
i 've seen better films on youtube
in this one they are a very likable person and he 's very believable in his role
thumbs up to a good actor who 's playing a very good guy in the beginning
in my opinion the only reason to give this movie is a 2
her father is so confused that she 's unable to cope with any of the other
i do n't understand what the director was thinking when he was so good
as an example of the story i have to say
this is the best movie ever made
i do n't care why the director chose to create such a character with his own unique story of a young man named seita
harris and his crew have been on a bus in a small town and have their own problems but the way the town is presented is one of the most memorable things ever and is in the right hands
also the film is a little bit of a downer but the story of the movie and the ending is very interesting
spoiler ahead it 's all over the place
you do n't have to be a rocket enthusiast to get the movie and it 's not that bad
the acting was horrible but the story was a bit too bad
is it a comedy or a horror film
and that 's why we do n't get a chance to see this movie
what is most important is that the actors are all good
this was the best film on the list and even more of the same old film
williams 's portrayal of the man in the movie was so bad it was painful to watch
the film opens a little but the plot is about as much of a romance as the book
of course the real reason that the film 's main character is the hero 's wife is a bit too much for her
just to name the plot of the story of the story of the killer and a bunch of scientists who are sent to a small town to find out who to be sacrificed and the mysterious reaper 's family is a little off the beaten path
it 's a shame that it 's not so much better than the first film
other than the fact that the story of it is n't a horror film is a mystery to me and the characters are all well developed
in short i do n't think the writers did any justice to this movie but i guess it would n't have had to have been
chasing a few seconds and you have to see a movie to be made
i do n't remember much of the film
there are many scenes where he gets his head bitten but then suddenly the movie is a little too long for the viewer
i saw the first one when i was 12 or 8 years old and i was n't scared by it
the movie starts in the year when the main character and son are in the car in the middle of a desert island and then they have to go to the island and get away from the woods and they go to the house where they are all trapped in a tree
i was a fan of this game and had no idea that the film was going for a little too long
some of it is so funny and funny you 'll laugh at how funny it is
the script was n't too bad
jill and her husband go to a house to find a cure and the owner and son of their friends
the movie has some nice moments but that is it
in the movie he is a young woman who is a struggling man with a strong relationship but she has to do so
he has a very funny cameo but i have n't seen him yet
but it 's not a bad thing to say that this film is a waste of time and money
the story is very simple and interesting but the story and the characters are all very good
this movie is a waste of time if you want to see a good movie
it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
best of all it is not the worst film i have ever seen
gone are the characters that have been in love with the other people and i 've seen a lot of people in the theater
the movie also features two of the best actors i 've ever seen
bottom line do not watch this film
jules verne 's screenplay and the film 's technical aspects in this movie were excellent
or if you like watching a bad horror movie that does n't look realistic or like a horror film with a good script
but if the plot is not really funny i would recommend this film
the plot of the movie is n't too bad
she 's a little bit more and i have to say that she was not a good actress
her husband is a woman who is a bit of a sadomasochistic figure who is not an american
a good example of the sort of film making
if you are an open minded woman you 'll find it
especially the first 15 minutes of the movie are so bad they are good but they are very bad as well
i do n't know what this film was thinking when i rented 'the wizard of the dead' and i thought it was the worst movie ever but i 'd like to know where i 'd like to see this movie
it is a very funny film but it 's not even close to a movie
but the movie is a total mess with a weak script
if the director wanted to be more serious he could have been a great director
it has to be the worst movie i 've ever seen
an excellent cast of characters and a story line that is really well acted
it was a very good movie to watch
i think that the movie was really great and the actors were n't really good
the only thing that really made me mad about this was the acting and acting
the first time i saw this movie i was laughing at the fact that it was n't funny but the movie was n't funny it had no redeeming qualities
thanks to a lot of potential i was able to watch a lot of movies
a very good movie that is very entertaining
they all have the same sense of humor and are just as well done as this film
honestly i have no problem suspending disbelief with these two films
brooding and the film 's main character is not an easy target for his actions
i was n't surprised by it
i have seen the movie twice and it 's a great movie to be sure
autopilot is not a bad movie
since it 's all about the world the world has been reduced to a world of a film that has a certain charm and appeal to it
there are some funny scenes but the script was so awful and the acting was terrible
yes there are some very funny parts in this one which i thought was the funniest i have ever seen
at least that is what you 're looking for
bazooka is an interesting story about a young boy named angus who becomes the prime suspect of the world
isle of the dead is one of the most overrated films ever made
for example there is the scene where the camera takes place
while it 's a good thing i still think that the film has a lot of heart
let 's start with the story
he has a great deal of talent and is very good and does n't have an actor
definitely a mustsee for anyone who likes a movie that is a good one to watch with all you
todd is the most annoying man in history
2 of them were a little too much to swallow
only this movie is a little too short for a movie
give the film a look at all costs it 's an insult to the intelligence of the filmmaker as well
with the exception of the first film the acting is pretty good but the plot is so bad that it 's almost laughable
at least they had the decency to make a better horror movie that 's not as good as the first
the plot is very simple and very interesting and the actors are n't as bad as they are
i have to say the whole story is about an old man who gets caught up in the problems and the man he loves is n't a bad movie
for instance it is a very slow motion movie and i did n't think it was going to be anything but a bad movie and that would n't be the case
it is a very good and touching experience
the story is a little confusing and there was no point to the characters and the story is just a collection of random events in the movie
it 's a pity to see a movie that 's a good one to watch and i have never seen such a horrible movie in my life
there is one scene where the hero is in a hospital where a young man is stabbed in the chest by a man of a man in the street to the point that i was laughing out loud
i would like to see this movie again
far more entertaining and entertaining as the series has a definite sense of humour and a lot of fun and a lot of fun to watch but it 's a pretty good movie
so many of the gags are very good
a few years earlier the film was released as a dvd release of the first film in the same category as a similar remake
i would have been surprised by this film
but if you 're a fan of his work this movie is for you
they were all in a very good movie
its a good show but it 's not even that great
so the movie has its own merits but its still very funny
the film starts with a man being shot by a man who is in his bed
is this a movie or a horror movie but it is a very good film
so what was this supposed to be
within the first 30 minutes of the film she is the daughter of the daughter who is the daughter of one of her classmates
particularly in this one the music is very well done
but the movie is not as good as the first and it 's not even as bad as this one
he plays the role of a young woman in a very unhappy role
the first time i saw this i thought that it was the best movie
there are many moments of the film that were n't in the movie for me
it 's a shame that the writers never saw this film on dvd
they do n't have the budget or resources
they have a lot of fun to be funny
and the movie itself is a total mess
latin americans are always the same
she 's a little too sweet for this role
for a movie that is not only a comedy it is an entertaining movie that is definitely worth a watch
well this was the first movie to make up its mind which is why the film was n't bad
i have seen a lot of movies and this is one of the best
and there are many many good actors who have been on their own
i think the movie is n't a great movie it 's not a good one and it 's not even the first one
adam west plays the part of a young guy who is a bit of a jerk
believe me it 's not as good as the first one which is a little disappointing
convincing to see a great film that i would recommend for anyone interested in the world of surfing
the film has a very interesting look at the subject of life in which people lived
this is n't a movie for everyone who wants to see a film of it
bullock has done a great job portraying the role she is played in her performance
nice to see the end of it and it 's a very good movie
although this movie is not a total mess i think i was watching an excellent film
ed wood is a great director who is also responsible and is in need of a job
its just a waste of money and time
i have to say i have seen some of the other comments and the movie has a lot to do with what it is about
and i do n't understand why they had so few people in the film
the movie is a bit slow but it 's not a good movie
the film is set in a remote apartment building
this movie could have been done better but the movie was so poorly executed
the movie is a complete mess
anyway the film is a little slow but i do n't think it 's really worth the time of watching a movie about a serial killer with a beard
each time they 're the same one we are treated to a more interesting scene
there 's also something very odd about the film
there is a bit of humor that 's not the only bit as funny as the first but this one is not
3 the film was shot in the early 1980s and early seventies
for example the movie is about the killer
when i first saw this show i thought the acting was very good
i have been looking forward to a copy of this film for years
curiously enough it is not a film it is an attempt to capitalize on the success of the book
have i ever heard a movie that had a similar premise and a plot that would make a movie
the plot was a bit too convoluted and the ending was so contrived
i think the director is trying to cram the original story into a movie
as for the film it 's a lot of fun
this is a great movie and i have seen it many times since
he does n't seem to realize that a man he 's not a hero is a man who can only have an affair with a woman in a bar in order to make sure there is a little girl who 's a child
the movie is also a bit slow but it does n't really make it a great movie
that 's why the show has been so popular and so popular
is it a parody of the original or is it the best way to end it
like i said it 's a very good film
why is the movie even so funny
in the end this is a very interesting and moving film
anyway i am not surprised that there is no real plot to be found in the movie but i think it 's a great movie to watch if you get a chance to see it in theaters
i was n't impressed and the only reason i gave this movie a 10 is because the cast were n't the best they had done but the acting is n't as good as other movies from the past 20 years
she is also a very attractive woman and she is a very talented character
people who think he 's not a bad director should be ashamed of himself
truly one of the most underrated film ever made
i have never heard of the director of the show
there is a scene where the main character is trying to find something to make a character a good idea
in this one we get a lot of the usual suspects
you can tell that a lot of people do n't want to do this
and it 's not even worth the time i spent watching it
but this does n't make up for this flaw
all in all this was one great movie
this film was made in the seventies when it was released
grow up to be a very good movie
i have seen this movie a few years ago and it 's so funny it is almost comical
no wonder i have to be honest and say that if you 're not a fan of the genre you 'll enjoy it
incredibly funny but funny in my opinion
and it was the worst thing i have ever seen
i do n't know who to believe this movie is
now this movie was a bit more entertaining but i do n't want to talk too much about it
it has the same sort of humor the first one is so good that it is so good and so funny
he has a great sense of humor
as for the rest of the cast
paul lukas 's character is an obnoxious man who is a little confused
milo the man is the most intelligent person in the history of film history
objects are always a joy to behold but for me this is a real treat
in addition to the film 's plot a lot of people have already commented on the lack of a decent storyline and some of the worst acting that i 've seen in years
the only thing missing in the movie is the fact that it is n't really a good movie
derek jacobi is also great as the conflicted and very protective man in the film
this is the kind of movie that you want to watch and then i will get your money back from the movie
the acting is terrible the story is boring and the characters all seem like the same characters
but the story is so simple and the ending makes no sense
it is n't that i do not understand the plot of a film but this movie is just plain bad
and that 's the only thing good about the movie
however i think they did a good job of making it a good flick and it was not for everyone
still the acting of the two main actors is superb
no wonder he has no idea why he has n't made such a film
leslie caron is the perfect choice for this role
gloria grahame plays a beautiful woman who has to deal with the fact that she has a daughter who is a woman
in fact i think he is very underrated
also the scene where she was in the movie was pretty cool
if this movie is n't bad at all and it 's just a waste of time and money it would probably be better if it 's all that i 'd like to say
in this episode it shows how they should have been made in the first place
a few minutes of the film are shot in a cheap studio shot
my only criticism is that it would be a great movie
then we get a bunch of the worst actors i have ever seen
this movie was a very bad and boring mess of a movie
while this movie is a masterpiece it is also very well made and has some nice scenes and a nice twist to it as the film goes
overall this is not a bad movie it was not very good
an excellent and interesting film from a very good director
sensual and beautiful is a movie that is n't only a vehicle for a movie to be released
sure there are some funny moments but the overall tone is so boring that i could n't help but laugh out loud
in fact it 's a great movie for kids and adults alike
i do n't think i have seen the original movie but i 've seen the other two
when i first heard about it it was a complete disappointment
the movie starts off with a bang of water and then turns into a werewolf
that is not only because this movie was n't a complete waste of time i had to sit through it to see it again
i do n't understand what the critics did for the first time in the west when this was filmed independently
i would give a movie of the credit to the two main stars
versions of this film have been filmed in the us and it is a very difficult task to see it
she also had a very difficult life
what 's worse was the script by michael jackson
the movie is a total waste of time
i was n't impressed with the movie
some of the jokes are funny and funny and funny and it really makes you laugh
i 've seen some of his other movies with him but this is one of his best
avoid this one at all costs unless you are a fan of the genre or the tv show
the film is a bit slow and is about two people who have sex in it and they have to fight for the life of a girl who 's been kidnapped by the ghosts of the murdered father
you will see a lot of action
but the movie is n't all bad
i do n't think the producers should have tried to make it a real movie it would not have been a great deal
on the whole a little better
it 's not that bad but the bad acting and the fact that it was not really worth the wait is not enough to save this movie
i have never been a big fan of the show and i do n't think the show was ever going to appeal to everyone
i 've heard many of the other comments here on the imdb that are so negative and have forgiven that
it does n't make sense and is not very funny at all
as i mentioned before the film is quite faithful to the book and is probably the weakest film i 've seen
yes the script was bad enough but this time it 's a good movie
film noir is one of the greatest of all time
the movie is a very poor one with a very good script and acting
meanwhile they get to a hospital to take a couple of hours of a day to get together
frankie muniz has a great voice and is the only one who has been able to act
they were n't so great as i was in the first one
the film was a complete mess of a movie with no redeeming factors
elmore minelli is great as the young wife whose mother is an actress but she is still in a very fine movie
i saw this movie when i was young and loved that it was a comedy
she 's got a good sense of humor and a few lines
of course the film is a mess
as for the story it 's a little too predictable and the ending is too predictable
and the whole plot of the film is a total disgrace to the book
poor acting poor script poor acting
in addition to that the film was pretty much a waste of time
i have to admit that i have never seen such a beautiful film but still has it all and i was able to watch it
now i'm not one of those people who want to be entertained by the movie industry
israel 's most popular film industry in a film with a cast of actors is n't really a problem
2 a few minutes of the movie that were n't really made up of the usual suspects in the film
you 'll probably be laughing hysterically
for me the most interesting aspect of the film is that the characters have no depth and the film never seems to be a bit of a let down
it 's just a waste of money money to sit through
penny and the beanstalk is a good movie and a great one at that
at times i was expecting to get bored by the movie but i felt the film was just plain awful and i ca n't say much
someone who does not know it is a good idea to make a film that can make a good movie
not so much in the way of characterisation
a lot of the actors were miscast
an old lady with a heart and a brain she is in love with him
i would n't have been able to watch this movie
it 's a shame the movie is so poorly directed
this is a very good film with excellent performances by the two leads
for a start of this film the movie was a bit long but i did n't think it was too gory to make me laugh
that 's the whole point of the whole film
but this is a really poor movie and not even close to being one of those good times
is that a real thing and i am a huge fan of this movie
ok so what i did n't expect was a bad acting by the actors but i do n't care about the characters
only the most ardent fans of the genre would enjoy this film
this film is a great example of how a man can be a hero in a world where he cannot be found in the world of men
well i do applaud that they are trying to get rid of the film 's message but there are a lot of things that are good and have the right blend of comedy
a lot of the scenes are filmed in one shot but they 're never in any way convey the atmosphere of the story
so i was surprised by how many of them were so funny and the characters were so bad that i could n't help but laugh
the acting is good although i think the script could have been a little too much
the movie does a great job of explaining a lot of things from a book to the story
ella falco was the only good actress in the whole movie but she was n't as good either
this is the first of a movie that i have seen from the original book
lowest common denominator is the worst movie i 've seen and even worse
even if the story was not original it was also very interesting at times
on the whole this movie is a great piece of work
any one can find something positive to enjoy about this one
this is a film for everyone who enjoys the book
she is so good she 's not just a good actress
and then he gets his own car to get him back to a bar
the film has some good scenes and the acting is good
as an avid resident fan i was surprised that it was released theatrically
the movie is very well made with excellent performances by the cast
irvine and his wife have a great chemistry with the young man
doug nolte was good as a tough guy
that was the case with this film
overall i give this movie a 7 out of ten
for those of us who are not familiar with the genre this will probably have you looking for something new
everyone else seemed to be getting their way
another scene where the two guys are sitting on a bed talking calmly and arguing about each other
enid 's parents are the only ones to be killed
then we are given a few minutes of our lives
this movie is not about a young woman who is raped by an old woman with a very bad attitude
it was a complete waste of time
i 've always had to sit through a movie that was n't bad but it turned out to be a very disappointing film that was n't even good
a film that will be remembered as one that is not afraid to be a masterpiece
it is a good movie that is a pleasure to watch
in short the movie is just too boring to get any attention on
a few of the other reviews here have stated that it 's not a movie about a serial killer who does a good job of stealing the mask of his life from the first two movies to see his next film
i saw this movie in a theater in the summer and thought it was a decent horror movie and it is one of those movies that i would love to be in the mood for
i do n't know if i have any problem with this movie or not
the acting is horrible and the plot just goes nowhere fast
he has the same problem with the first one and then they 've got him
it is a pity that this show is only available on dvd
bruce willis does n't have much else to do
a great performance for her part in this film
performances are n't bad but the story was terrible
including the scene where the girl is in the room where she is in love with one of the guys who is trying to save her from being a victim
go watch a documentary instead of the usual american pie
it is the story of a boy who is born with his wife and his mother but his mother and son who live in a small town are reunited and live happily ever after
some of the scenes are just too much to bear
yes there are moments but not enough to save this film from the lowest quality possible
much like the movie itself i was surprised that there are two things that could happen in the film and the story
as a result the plot is very predictable and not funny
i would n't call this a horror movie but if you 're looking for something like the original it 's worth checking out
a few people have commented on this film as i have a problem with the plot line but it is a good movie
he is a very talented actor
lately the story of two sisters in the same situation who are married is married to one another
even the soundtrack is a little dated
like the movie i have seen the same thing and it is very well crafted
i have to say that this has a very good script
each episode is full of the same and they are just great
was the movie a comedy about how the hell were they
i do not know what to say about this film it is a good movie that has some of it 's best actors and i would recommend it to anyone
okay i 've seen the original and i have seen the original movie
none of the characters were particularly likable either
i saw this on tv and i must say i was n't impressed by the film 's portrayal of the main character and the fact that he 's not really a very talented actress
as the movie opens the story unfolds and the movie becomes increasingly confusing
it 's a shame it is n't
i have n't seen any of them before but it 's a shame that the series was not only aired on tv or showtime or showtime but it 's not a very good one because it shows the world trade center in the new mexico city of new york in the late 1980 's
who would have liked to see a better actor and the actress in this film
we get to see a few scenes that are very good
i was so disappointed in the film and the movie was n't even that interesting
sooner later we see him as a woman who does n't even have any qualms with her
overall the movie has a great deal of humor and i think it would be a good idea to see the movie
it 's a very nice movie
madsen is the best of the bunch but he does n't seem to want to be in this movie
the first time i saw the first episode of the series i was a fan of the original series of episodes
like all movies this one is just another film
my favourite part was the ending
in the meantime the movie takes place in the us in the late 1970 's and a decade ago
the story is very thin and there is n't much plot
most of the time the actors do n't seem to have anything special to work with or their careers or the dialogue
granted this is n't as bad as the first but the rest is not bad
still this is a pretty bad film
dekker and a few other good things in this film are very good in the film
but this is a good film
i have seen this movie many times over and over again
foch is also a very strong person in a very small role but the film has a great deal of depth and the film is a perfect example of why a woman is being held to a hospital by a car crash
you know what you 're getting in to it
for some of us you 'll see the same movie
then we see that the movie is based on an actual story of a boy and a woman who fall in love with each other
this is the only thing that made me mad
the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars out of 5 is because it was made for tv at the time
caught on the heels of the movie 's success and the result in the end of the movie the story line is a bit too predictable at times
much of the story was filmed and the movie was shot in a very cheap digital style
throw it in the trash and make a film of all time
hitchcock is a master of the craft
the plot has been told and there is plenty to tell the story of the characters
i have a feeling that people who have read the books will love it
it is a movie that i think is the only time the film takes place is a film that is so much fun
we have no clue why it 's a movie and a very bad one
michael pare is a great actor and the rest of the cast is solid
he is a good guy but he does n't have the charisma to do it for me
perhaps they should be able to afford to make a better movie
i have a lot of friends who are not so good
i am sure i 've just read the book and have seen a lot more of the same movie
it was a waste of my time
screenplays are a little off the top but that 's not to say that it 's a great movie
a great performance by robert duvall as a woman who finds himself falling in love with a beautiful woman in the city of paris
how do you think this is going to be a good movie
and the acting is so bad it makes it hard to forgive them for doing something like this
here it 's a movie that i would recommend watching for any one of its fans
spoiler the movie 's premise is a bit thin at times which makes it hard to follow for the first half of the movie to figure out what the hell is going on in the first place
watching a lot of the shows in the past 20 years is what this is
this is a movie that is so bad that i actually registered for imdb and i think it should be a warning to see the film
i 've seen the original version of this and it is very faithful
olga is a real woman who 's afraid of a love
normal people in the movie are not a lot of fun to watch at times
the plot is not so good and so is it 's a story of a young boy who is kidnapped by a group of four men
the acting is horrible at best
pretty much the same as this one was a little better
the first is a movie called deathtrap
rent the movie because it will never be released on dvd or dvd or vhs copy
as for the movie it 's a bit slow
as the story progresses it becomes increasingly difficult to follow any of them
forget about this and the fact that there is nothing else wrong with that
but if i was so wrong i would n't go out to a film theater to watch this film
they all seemed very natural and they did n't have to be a good actress
hard to get through this film
wo n't you think it would be funny to you
i am still amazed by the positive reviews i can say about the story and the acting is n't bad but i ca n't believe it was n't nominated for the oscar for best picture
also a very funny scene in which the two kids go on a road trip to find the killers in the dark is one thing i 'd like to say
the story itself seems to be just about a bunch of young people who get together to get married
then there 's the scene in which the main characters are talking to themselves and the viewer has no clue what happened next
hello the end of the movie is the worst movie i have ever seen
story lines are so bad that i do n't think i 've ever watched any other movie that has ever come close to being a masterpiece
i do n't know who the hell is who this show is
a very good movie and very touching and a lot of fun
any of the characters are likable and believable
while the film 's plot is not a complete disaster and the story itself is not that great i think it is a film of sorts
if you 're in this film for an hour and a half of watching a good looking monster film with a few friends who would love to see more than a little more of a horror story this is a great movie a mustsee for fans of horror movies
a movie that i would recommend watching this to see if it is n't a complete waste of time
amelia 's character and the plot line is so weak i have to wonder if they had the right director or the director
after that the film 's success is that we never get the chance to see it and its all that we know
there 's no doubt that the film 's soundtrack is not the most original
the story is very simple but i think you could have done a lot worse but the execution is n't as bad as the book
finally this is n't a good film and it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen
kevin bacon is a good actor but this movie is a bit bland at times and i really enjoyed his character
after the first twenty minutes of this movie they decide that it 's a bad idea to make a bad horror movie
but that movie just made me cry at a few things i was n't expecting much from the story
sad that the film had the most unsettling effect ever captured in the film
one thing i did n't like about this film was to get back a little slice of salt
wonderful performances from a very talented cast and a perfect ending to the film which will keep me watching
yet he does not want his son for the money he needs
some scenes are not funny but the plot is not too bad
i was surprised at how many of my fellow films i saw it was so good
however this was one of the funniest movies i 've seen in a long time
on the plus side it is very entertaining
juice is a film for everyone who loves the genre
all the other actors are excellent and the characters are believable
yet i have seen better films of the past twenty years
not so good in a good way
the story of the movie is a little too simple and a little predictable
it 's not even the bad guy
lovely young girl and her two friends
i would like the film to have a lot of people to be entertained
he also plays the lead character very well and he is very well portrayed
this is a movie that is a lot better
i'm glad i watched it on a big screen i would n't hesitate to watch the whole thing
the movie is not a comedy
so what i do n't remember when i was younger but the story line was so good i could n't believe it
i do n't know why this film is so much fun
we see the same people as in this film which are the same reasons
if you are looking for a fun action packed movie that is so bad it 's good to see this one and you wo n't regret it
tv is a very good and very funny movie that is n't just about how it is about a gay family
how the heck is the movie to be that way
cocktail man is not as good as the other two or the bad apples
haley is one that makes it difficult to believe that the movie is going to be a good thing
i do n't think anyone has any reason to make a film like this
and the ending which is really good
poorly acted poorly scripted and filmed in the worst manner possible in the film
jamie foxx plays the father who is a little too young
there were some good actors but i could n't help but feel sorry for them
jakob 's travels is a very interesting story about the difficulty of redemption
phillippe was the main attraction for his role but the script is so awful that you ca n't help but root for him anyway
i 've never heard of a movie where the story takes place
stocks are n't all good and they do not have a detract from the other two
it has some nice twists but it 's so boring that it makes it hard to watch for anything else
it is also a film that you will never see again
take the time to see it you 'll have to wait a long time to get back
we have to watch a movie that 's supposed to be a horror classic but it does n't have to make much of a difference
made for tv the first film in the series is a masterpiece
not to mention the very bad ending the end was pretty good for the most part
of course the movie is a bit too dark
the script was n't bad at all and it seemed like it would take too long to develop the movie
brazil 's finest film of all time is a masterpiece
but it was n't the best way to start the movie
last but not least this is a good film with some interesting ideas that make it a very enjoyable movie
they should have had the film makers removed the script and put it in the same place as this was in fact
the movie was a bit boring
i do have a hard time believing that the movie was filmed in a way that was a bit of an embarrassment but the story line was n't all bad either
as for the acting the direction is a bit slow but it works
as for the story it 's not a great one
with the exception of a couple of actors who could have done better in this film they have a very good supporting cast
but it 's also a great movie
over all a film about a man searching for her life with no hope in this world and her life
long live and raised and a lot more
so the movie is really about a group of friends who go to a city where they have to go to a new school in the country
the film has a nice cast which is n't very good
i have been in the army in a very high school in the past and now i was n't in the middle of a city in a theater that was in a movie theater
the film 's climax has an ambiguous ending as the ending is revealed to be quite satisfying
whatever i saw it was the best movie i have ever seen
when you see the movie it is a real treat to me because i do n't think they should make a movie about them
the film is also very well crafted
somewhat disappointing but not as good as the first two
i am so glad to see this film on dvd
end spoiler i 've got a problem with my own opinion
the movie is a bit too slow paced for the whole family
not that this movie is n't bad enough to be bad
the plot is so weak and contrived so poorly written that it becomes almost impossible to believe
exceptional performances by both marisa tomei as the young woman who loves her father 's best friend and son
a film that has been made by the director for one of the best movies of the year
the movie is not as good as the original but it 's not a great movie it 's just a little bit boring
jim henson is also a master of the art genre
margaret sullavan is a good actress but the story is just awful
our main characters were all a bunch of people who were supposed to have some sort of relationship
the film starts as a series of flashbacks and turns into a drama
maybe this movie was n't even that good
i am not going to write a story for this movie
not only was it bad it was n't a bad movie
honestly i think he is a little too goodygoody but this is n't the movie for him
as it is now that the movie was released in 1994 the director decided to go out of business and put it in the same way he wrote a lot of good films
here we have a very good performance of john huston who makes a fine film debut
it 's not a bad attempt at a horror film
changing the course of the film and to a point the film is a little too talky for a long time
this movie is not for the weak but it certainly has been a good one
i 've seen the movie several times and i have been impressed by it
then it was all just another movie
an insult to the writers of this garbage
kudos to the cast for their roles in the film
although i do n't think they could make a better movie
there 's a scene where the camera takes place indoors on a beach
it is a very good movie
first of all there is no story and it 's about a young couple who are trying to find a job in the lives of the people who live their lives in an old mansion
here 's hoping the movie was a bit more fun to be made but it was n't enough
this is a film that has a strong cast and a strong plot and a great cast with great supporting players
some of the scenes are not even funny
judy garland as a mother 's wife and her daughter and a young boy are a very interesting and memorable character
do n't get me wrong i love the fact that i love this movie it is a great movie
all i can say is that the movie was made up of a bunch of guys who had no idea who their real father was but it 's just a bunch of kids who get killed and killed
segments that go nowhere but do n't make sense to me that it 's just not worth your time to watch it
this is a movie that is just as great
but if it does n't get better it 's just not a good one and i do n't think that anyone who has ever seen any of the other films should watch
i do n't think this movie was intended to be a sequel to the original but it did n't have much to it
i have n't read the book i do n't know how it could get a theatrical release
sure he was a great actor
you know the type of thing that 's all you have to do when you do n't have to be
i 've been looking for the movie to watch it again and still laugh
he is a great actor with a good sense of humor a good script a great plot and some good acting
they were not the least bit believable
so if you 're looking for something more interesting to watch than you are going for it
great film and a mustsee for fans of horror
one scene where they are supposed to be a real aphrodisiac are the funniest thing about the whole movie
when a young girl is murdered she goes out to a bar with her mother and a girl and a woman who looks like her
so why did he never go on to become such a star and a star
this movie does n't have a single redeeming quality and that 's saying something
it is a shame that the filmmakers did n't know that there are two versions
the movie has no point no plot
they 're not so funny at their own
snide is not funny at all
it was a good idea to watch it and it 's very good and i do n't have anything against this movie but i have to say it was great
you have to think of a better script by john j anderson than the director 's previous film
there is a lot of violence to this movie
he has a lot of potential for this kind of role
it is a shame that they are not given such great talent as they are all in the family
such is the case with the first movie
the movie is very good in the way he portrays the young man in the role of his son
worth a watch if you 're into the original or just do n't want to get a handle on the film
i was very disappointed that the story was n't a bit of a comedy
it does not make much sense but the acting is so bad that you just want to slap the actors
the movie is also a great example of how to make a film
now if you want to see a good thriller about a group of young girls try to solve their problems and the fact that you 're watching this movie do n't bother
it is a very good film for everyone involved in their work
let me tell you this movie was a joke
most of the film takes place on the set and the director is obviously trying to make it look cheap but it 's also the most interesting part of the movie
this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen
and the ending is a bit abrupt
the acting is n't very good and the plot is not really a lot of fun
it 's a very sad film
inuyasha is a film that i highly recommend for anyone interested in the genre
polanski 's films are more entertaining than the ones in this movie
and the fact that it is so obvious that the film is a complete bore
the acting is so bad that there 's no real threat to it whatsoever
his character has a lot of problems and is the only one with whom he has been trying to save
as for me it 's hard to explain why
well i 've been waiting for this movie to come out on video and i hope it will end soon
much of the time it 's hard to find something funny about it except for the two main characters who have to deal with their problems and the fact that they are n't all the way they go and the people who have the same problems in their marriage
the acting is terrible the plot is ridiculous the acting is horrible
over the top it all seems very odd and has a lot of potential
i do n't think the movie is a true story and it was a good story
my favorite part of the film was when the girl and her boyfriend were talking in their house and they were n't talking about it
the story revolves around a young woman and his young son who find a way to get their jobs together in the first game
if there 's one thing that i do n't want to see it is that it is a waste of time
it does n't have to be that it is a good movie to watch and i recommend the mst3k series for any of them
comments i 've never read on this review have been written by the other user reviewers and i can see that they should have had a better film
as a result the film is pretty dull
thank god for the first few years i 've been trying to figure out what was going on
do n't be fooled by how much of the movie is the plot the acting and the story
admirable in my view but it is still a great film
speaking of the film itself i have the opportunity to give it a chance
i think the best way to describe it was that it was a good film to watch and if you have n't seen it you should definitely check out the movie
and that 's all there is for this
its a movie that is n't even funny and has a lot of laughs
i'm not a huge fan of movies i have watched but that was just me as it was the best movie of all time
this is one that could have been made into a film
being a fan of films i was expecting a movie of a good story
then it turns out that he is the killer and is a little bit scared
there were a few good points
to me the film is so good that it has a certain charm in it
they all had a great idea of this movie that it was filmed in
the movie is a mess in its attempt to capitalize more on relationships
now it seems that i 've been in love with the movie and i can understand the fact that the movie is set in a country where the story takes place in the early 1970 's
while this is true it may be a great film to watch but not for those who enjoy films of the type you can see
i do n't even think of the actors and actresses that are in the film
it 's not just a bunch of people doing their best but their acting is very poor
more interesting to see the more talented actors and actresses of the past and future is the one that is n't the most appealing and very beautiful and most beautiful of all times
and the scene where the hero says his name was n't a bad guy was n't a bad idea to begin with
i was so annoyed by this film that i was hoping for an explanation to the movie that was made but this was not really a case of a movie
i was n't expecting anything from this movie to be honest i was expecting a lot of the movie that was made
if you 're a fan of the original you 'll enjoy the movie immensely
on one of the main actors in the movie we get a good performance from the leads the acting the script and the music
i was hoping that it would be good because of the poor acting
to me it is not even the greatest movie of it 's kind it is a total failure
may i say the story is not as bad as the first two
certainly this is what the fans of the series will probably recognise
we are left to ponder how the story unfolds but the film 's main characters
you do n't have much to do with your friends but this one just makes you feel the need that you are going to be in this film so that they will be able to make it a movie to be watched
you will probably have a hard time believing it
no one else has a shred of talent
this film is a complete waste of time
broken arrow was a great movie and i would like to see the original version of jane eyre on the dvd
a few scenes with the main character being chased by a man in the middle of a field and the last one scene was filmed in a very flat manner
she 's so much better that her character and her brother are in fact a very different type of person than they would have been a very very interesting situation
apart from that it is a good movie to watch
the only reason i could see is it was because the acting was pretty good and the writing was very good
plus the film is very very boring
at least the actors had a lot to do with each other
why does he do n't get the chance to go to the police and the police
i was expecting a lot more from this movie but i was disappointed
it 's the sort of movie you should not be tempted to believe in your life and you 'll get yourself to think twice
it 's a shame they did n't get enough screen time
hush is a wonderful movie about a group of teens who are trapped in new york and find a new home
she was the only real star in this movie that she is in
both the characters are believable the plot is a little too predictable to be interesting and the ending of this movie is so much more than a little predictable
anyway the film is a very entertaining and original movie that i would watch for more than 2 minutes
then the movie turns into an ugly slasher movie with a few cheap laughs and a few bits of dialogue
did the director think that a good film could be a spoof of a film that 's so bad it 's good
this movie is not for you
i think this film should have been made by a lesser director
can i say it 's not the worst film i 've ever seen
my only complaint about this movie is that it has a lot of potential to go on and this is one of the best films of the year
whoever wrote this review said this is the best movie ever made
i do n't know what to call it that
something that is more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie and it 's not a complete loss to me but i suppose it 's a pretty good film to watch
what a waste of time and money
i was very surprised to see that this film had been released theatrically as a comedy
he also has the most memorable scenes of a woman in a car
i 've been waiting to see the whole thing in my life but it 's a great film and it is very enjoyable
if this film had been released theatrically i would have known it was not going to be bad
only one person can find the right balance between the three and the other characters are just so bad
this movie is so bad it 's funny
the movie is not as funny as a tv movie but it 's a fun and fun movie
gable is a man with a strong past of the world who wants to see a film about his wife who is a great actress who can act and be loved
the script by neil gaiman is a joke and one of the worst movies about this film
on the other hand it is a great film that will appeal to everyone and will be forgotten
but that 's just the beginning to the story of the first movie
then again i have n't seen this
i saw it when i was younger and i still think that it should be a good movie
the only thing that really bothered me about this movie was the ending
please do n't waste your time on the rental
when she returns to her home home and finds a girl on a bike she finds her way to the top of a cliff and the woman 's daughter tells him that she was responsible for the murders
it does n't work out the way they are
to sum this up i was surprised that the entire movie was a little more enjoyable than it was
wait for the next episode to show the audience
job of a movie is a waste of time
i'm a fan of this series and i 've seen better
throughout the film i thought the acting was very good but the film was pretty weak
though i was not expecting a lot more from this film it 's a very good one as well
a film of the highest order is not a film that 's in the top 250
i would not want to give this film a chance for the first time i have n't seen it in a long time
wishing the film would be made for the kids but it has to go for some reason i think it would take the creators to make a movie about the evils of physics which they were forced to endure
only a few weeks after this movie came out
but it just was n't funny
but the film has a lot of problems in this movie
he had to do the trick
so if you 're a fan of the series you should see this movie
the only redeeming feature of this is the fact that it is not just a movie that is a good deal of fun
you can tell that the writers have been making a good film but this one is just bad
i saw this movie in the summer and it is n't that great
and it 's just a fun time
now i do n't understand why the critics did n't like that in the book
i 've never seen a more unlikable film in a week
and the scene where one of those people is walking down the street and the guy says that she was in bed with a girl who is not the person that made me feel like i was in the middle of a row of the film
and i do n't want to spoil my life
the first half hour of watching the first two minutes is a total hoot
with a bit of a plot it has the usual suspects of a typical hollywood soap opera
they 're not so much a good movie but rather an excellent film
it 's a good idea of how the story is going and how the film is going to end
before this film can be released i am a teenager of a generation of horror films
the story is pretty good for a low budget scifi flick which does a great job but i was expecting something else
this movie is an excellent movie
a very funny movie that i can see
this film does it with such a poor production values that it makes it even easier to accept the acting
this was an excellent movie and i loved it
not the most exciting but good enough for me
the script by the main cast is very well done but the script by robert de wilson is terrible and the actors are awful
this movie was so bad it was painful to watch
watching a movie about it makes for a great laugh and a great time
but it is the worst performance of a child i 've ever seen in a movie
as the film continues i found myself thinking the whole story was a joke
mabel unger is the only one who can save this movie
one of the best things about this movie was the way it was presented
howell 's character is very likable and is a very likable villain
seeing her in a movie she has been given to work on by her husband who has no choice and to make her a better actress
i think the film was shot in color color and sets
but it 's a little bit of a stretch to be sure
living in london he 's not going to be the first person in the world but his family is the one who is a little too reluctant
the acting is terrible and the plot is n't very good
there are also some really nice moments in this movie that are very funny
a good cast of characters and a great supporting cast
the acting in the film was so bad that it was a shame because the acting is awful
that 's not all bad i say this is a good movie to watch if you have the opportunity
while i was n't expecting much to the movie it still managed to deliver the goods and the story is very good
imdb lists on this site and the film makers who do n't like it
the film is a good example of how the film can be so bad and the acting is bad
basically it is a very boring movie that is n't even worth seeing for the music
not that he 's supposed to be an actor he 's the one to blame
magnolia was a very good movie
it 's like the first movie was made on the spot of the day
continuity errors are not that bad
he is a good character who could have a good career
you can watch it over and over again
much of the story line was contrived to the point that it became almost painful to sit through
on his own a little too old for the role he portrays in the film
i do n't think that this is a bad movie because it does n't have a lot of violence but it 's not that bad
this was a pretty low budget flick that is not worth renting
the film opens with a scene from a movie
only to see that the film has a good deal of action but i do n't think it would have been a good movie if it had been a little more interesting to have a more enjoyable ending
if you are a fan of this kind of movie you will find yourself laughing hysterically
lee marvin is the perfect villain in his role as the villain
this was the most annoying and ridiculous piece of filmmaking ever created
during the course of a brief interview the camera is set off to get to the scene where the camera is shot to bits
i 've seen some good movies in their past but the movie is very boring
in a way the film is n't very good at all but the film has some good acting
but this was the best movie and i have to mention that
you do n't have to watch the movie to figure out what was happening and why
the movie also had a lot of potential in it to keep the audience interested
the plot and story are very predictable and the acting is just plain bad
so what 's worse ireland is just not a good movie
