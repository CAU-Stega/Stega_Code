there are a handful that are the ones that make me laugh but i was not entertained and it was a complete waste of time and time and money i wasted on this crap movie
but this movie is just awful it was awful
go out with some good luck to get to watch this and it 's worth checking out
oh yeah it was funny to see the previews roll on
it was a very funny movie and i loved the film
i was very surprised by the film 's quality
what 's a little odd about this film was the fact that the actors were n't really good actors and were the only reason why i would rate them as low
all in all this is a great movie to see as it was very well acted in parts
certainly one of his best works
people are n't the only people with a pulse and that 's all that is good about them
several of us are talking about that
the story has a lot of holes
a great cast including the likes of edward g mcginley and the always welcome chris rock star as a doctor who is a bit of fun and has some pretty good moments but this one lacks the charm that made him famous
spoilers i know it 's not
too bad that the only reason this movie was ever made is because it was released in the us on dvd
but this one was a disappointment and the only good part was seeing the first movie
i do n't know why but i did n't care about the characters
i have never seen such bad acting in my entire life as it 's my age and i think i would have been a better person to watch this movie and it would have made me more angry
everything about the story was contrived and predictable and the plot line did not make sense but the acting was so poor that i could not believe it was possible
i 've never seen a worse movie than that
i would n't go watch this movie as soon as i saw it
athletes are n't the only good thing in here
bob saget is also good in a very small town
silent film buffs will be disappointed to learn that if you are a big fan of the genre you will probably like that one
it 's not even a bad movie
it 's like an episode of sesame street but the real star of this movie
the only thing missing is the fact that it 's not a horror flick it has a certain element of suspense
because the script writer of all the pieces the film was a complete mess of an insult the film had no redeeming features
maybe he is not a good person but he does n't seem able that he can
laurel stone plays the father who is a cop at a private school
not that i would n't want to see the movie but i think it was really really bad to me as the filmmakers of this film thought it would be good fun to watch a movie about a guy who was trying so hard and failed miserably to get his teeth to look like a man
i do n't understand how they could have made this one of a sequel
i think that this one is a masterpiece
well the movie is not a bad one
when he is not on one hand or another he does n't know that he was a victim of the crime but he 's got his hands in his face when the police are the killers that is the only reason for this to happen
but it 's still a good movie
if there is any reason to go into the plot of this movie there was no way to get the film out
fulltime killer is a very good movie
he is a great actress but not as bad in a performance as the other
and it is the most interesting thing in history
i think it 's not a very deep movie
this movie is a total disaster and a total waste of my time
but the real thing i can say is this movie has been released on the dvd for a couple of years and is now to be sold to the dvd release of the movie in a dvd box set
it has a few good moments but it 's not a bad thing
no one can ever replace the fact that the audience is supposed to believe that there is no way that this was intended to be a movie that would n't even bother to explain why they had a lot of fun to say
this movie is one of the most boring
best of youth 's success is a very well made film
i was a kid with the exception of an adult actor and a woman that is the main actor
but the movie 's biggest flaw of the film is its ability at humor as it builds up and becomes a bore and the story is a little bit predictable and too slow
the first half of the movie was pretty good
how could they possibly be a bit more believable
and then you have no idea that there are so much more in the world the film is in
some people will have a great time in a cinema but i did n't really have anything to do in the movie but i found the film very well acted and the plot was very interesting and i thought the characters were believable and realistic
the movie is also about a man named benjamin whose mother and his friends are invited into the world of the holocaust
we get this movie from an unknown point and it 's a very long time to get back into it
a great cast is the one and only one to watch with an excellent amount of respect
i have never been a huge austen fan but the best of this kind of genre was his work
today 's movie industry is a very poor movie that is n't funny
but it was a great idea and this film is not a good one
john goodman is a wonderful actor who is n't the best of the actors and does n't look like it was his best film
he does a good job in this film
it 's like watching the same movie as i do and i have never seen a film so lovingly done that i do not know what it 's all about or what it was
anyone who likes this sort should watch it
not only do you see her face but also the character
well worth watching on the big budget to do a few other jobs but it 's a shame that it 's not
the script is so bad it makes you wonder why anyone could even care less of the plot holes or the plot
it is a good movie to be taken from a different perspective
looking at a cast of unknowns
my favourite part is the ending and the end credits
the film 's main character is the hero of the story the story line is a bit contrived
the film has some very nice sequences but it 's not enough for it 's good to really be able at
ignore the naysayers the film is about a man named billy
i do think the movie is a masterpiece
the only reason i even saw this movie was to see the end of the day
it 's a pity it was n't released in the us so that it 's a bit dated for me
watching the film was not a bad way to spend a saturday afternoon with a movie ticket on it
you 're not in this world
sadly the only thing in this film that is worth mentioning was when the movie ended
anyone interested with this film will likely enjoy it as much
lots of nudity and some nice gore
the film is a bit too dark for the first half hour and a little bit too slow but it has to be the best thing i have to say
if that 's true i 'll just say that
plus it 's a good story
the script is full of holes and the ending of this movie is a bit too slow
this one was made at the height of time
larry 's direction is a real treat to the viewer
watch the movie and you 'll know what i mean and it is n't just the movie you get the impression you will have to see it again to find it
yet the film is about a bunch and the two men are killed by the evil dead end
that 's what i think of the film
i do not see any movie to be entertained by this movie
the plot is about an american couple who have been sent to the island to investigate a mysterious plague that happened to be haunted by the earth 's past the earth has been hijacked by a giant robot and is rescued with some unknown creature and the creature is haunted by an evil witch named sosuke 's daughter
do you like the other characters in the film
i saw the movie when my parents were laughing and cried
but the best part is that they do not make any sense
alok nath is a good choice to play a woman who can only be so much of a loss to her as the young and experienced actress she was in fact
i saw it at the sundance film fest on television in 1995 it was a good show
it is a very enjoyable movie and one of those movies that is so bad it 's funny but it 's just too good for me because it was just bad and bad to me
sayles 's film version of hamlet is not a very funny one
this is not a good movie
i have to say that i am not sure how i could have seen this movie and the only reason i watched it was the music
so it is a movie to watch for your kids and it will be a fun time capsule
this is one that has a lot of good actors
i do not know what 's so great about the movie but it is still an interesting movie
the movie starts a little slow but is a little bit slow
spoilers i was n't impressed by the plot
the only thing i liked about it is that it 's a very interesting film with lots of laughs and an upbeat story
sometimes i feel like i am not alone on a chalkboard i ca n't describe a movie without a word of warning that i have n't had anything but to say
i'm not sure what to say about this movie but i would have given this 0 stars
indeed i found it difficult for me to believe that he could not have done a more convincing job
then there were the other characters who were very funny
in this movie it seems that the film makers have a lot in their minds
if you do not get the chance see this movie if it has to be on dvd
it 's a real shame that i have to pay a buck and watch it again because i do n't want a movie like this for that matter of my time
i saw this movie on the tube and it was n't a waste of time
what is this about this guy
eccentricities are the same things happen and the story is so weak that i have n't seen any other episode of this
bottom of the barrel to the point of nausea this is a movie that will be lost forever for the year
he plays a very normal character who does everything in his life as a character
one thing that bothered us was how many scenes were filmed with a camera and it was a very moving experience
garbage like this is the best way possible
while watching this film the only other reason i gave the film a 1 is that it was directed with some very good special effects
the film is very entertaining and it does a fine amount
instead it 's not a movie like that and there is no plot
the only good acting in the cast and it shows that this is just the beginning of a movie
have you heard that it was a real stinker
instead it was just a movie of the week
major spoiler i was very wrong when you read about this movie
where is my comment for it
and the ending is so stupid and contrived that it makes me cry
for the first time in a long time i was looking forward to seeing this movie
the first film had a few moments but i liked the film as well
the first half of the movie is a real treat but that is n't a good thing
as a result i could only see the director who has the audacity of having a good cast in the film industry
well i am not going to give this review the lowest possible rating
of course he 's not only a master of film noir but a great actor
well the real reason to see the movie is to find a way to get the message across
one of the greatest films in my book has the ability to pull a bit of my memory
i'm sorry that i can be wrong
just like the previous film this one is the most entertaining
these two were so bad it seemed like they just ran out of their seats in front of the screen with a different look
they do have a good time and they do n't make a movie about them
there are two characters that do what they are told of
i have seen the first two episodes and i think the movie is better than the original
and that 's why i love it and will like that
what a shame that this is not even a movie
after all this is a very good film about a man who has to deal in a small village
the acting in the other two films was superb and the actors were all very attractive
my only problem with this film is that the actors are all pretty bad
so i was surprised that the director was n't able to make the movie
the only reason i watched it is because i 've watched it countless dozen times and still have no idea how it is going on
thus we have all the usual suspects in the movie
the movie is a little slow at times
it 's a shame that they did have it released on dvd
if the movie had been made into a movie or a real film i would have thought the story had potential
james garner and david morse were a great addition but the movie was just plain awful the characters were annoying there 's the worst plot the acting and the special fx and i 've seen worse in the past
otherwise the film does not work as an interesting thriller
but i do n't think it 's a good film as a whole
just the story is a mess that is n't even the first of it and it 's not
the movie has a few good actors and a good story which is n't really a big plus for the film itself
for the most part it was not the greatest movie i have seen and certainly a little overrated but it definitely is one of the best
i do n't think it 's a coincidence to see a documentary of how much i like the movie but it 's so bad that i was laughing and it was n't the worst movie ever made it 's not worth renting it
in this case it seems like a very low quality movie but i ca n't believe that anyone would be interested at the time when making this movie and not even close
according that this movie has no place in the book
france is a very good movie and it is one thing to be appreciated
however the only reason to watch the movie was the soundtrack and i was really surprised to hear it was released
nightbreed and other movies are pretty entertaining and it is one that i 'd love
just as good is the case with a great deal of time
we all know it 's the only thing i have to say about it but it is not as bad as it sounds
yes they were n't really funny but it is not
it was n't a big success but a great movie
dreyfuss was a very bad choice for a good actor but the movie just does a good thing and is the only good thing about it and that 's what it 's a good movie and i recommend everyone else to watch it to watch
nothing new or original is the reason why the movie works so very well
his acting abilities were n't very good
my favorite scene is when he says that the movie was a hit
but there are some good actors and actresses
one of the worst movies ever i 've ever watched on my dvr and i 've seen a lot of movies and tv
am you really trying to find the story of a movie
think about the film the acting the story and the story
le cercle selznick is one hell of a movie and a good movie
a lot more than a couple
circa the beginning of the movie we are treated to a series which is not only boring but also interesting and the whole film has a very interesting ending and a good plot
funny in this case and the film is very well done
van heflin is a very talented actor and is excellent and this is not one to see the rest of her career but she also shines in this movie and is so beautiful in the role of the daughter in this film
for instance when the first two characters are killed and tortured and then later in a scene he sees the woman who has the power to kill her
apparently there is no need to use the same technique as the ones who have been associated
in the end it 's a bit too long
this is n't just a film it does boast a few good moments that will be in the mind of your brain
ther 's a good thing to say about this movie but i do not really get to know anything here
i am still trying to figure if the movie would have been much better if we 'd had a better ending
the first part of it shows what happened in a small town where a young child lives in the middle east in the middle age of the 20th states
i was surprised how bad a movie this could have possibly been
like i said before the first halfhour was pretty good for a movie with a great ending but it 's just too boring and boring
the story is very simple the dialogue the actors the direction all of the actors' actors are great
then there 's the guy in a suit suit who is supposed to be a hero with a lot of people
an attempt to create some sort of message about a man who wants a dead and a woman he can get rid
at least the filmmakers seem to have tried to create a new twist
finally the whole movie just seems too stupid and pointless to watch
if i could find something else to do with the plot and the cast i would not recommend this movie
while the story is quite good the acting was pretty good and i would n't recommend the film
i think you can see that there is a lot of talent involved in this production
1 it was n't that bad
but it 's a great show
the film is not a documentary it is also a movie for the whole generation
it is a story about two people who have to be seen for their lives and the people who come together in the same time
thing that is more than just a dream sequence with his mother and the girl 's daughter and the other guy is just so funny and it 's a pity that the film has n't been released
its a shame that this film has n't been released in the us for years
a few years later she 's in a coma
the story line was very good i liked the movie
its a pity that the makers of this film decided that they were making this up for a sequel
i was very surprised by the amount of violence and sexual violence
yes i was n't expecting much and there was some great acting but this was probably the best
the story line was good the characters were well developed and the script was so good that i thought the story line was interesting in this movie and the characters were very well developed to be honest
i do think this was the biggest problem i have with the movie
at first i thought it was an okay film and i did n't think the first movie was good
it 's not even that bad
i am surprised that a film like the one austen has made this so hard to watch
we get that we 've seen him as much as the main villain of the film and he makes a good appearance as the troubled man in charge of his character and his motivations
it 's like a bad dream film
i think he did n't do a good job
it was a little hard for me to find that he did n't know it was his first time but it was a bit too long
ok it 's not the same thing that it is
also in the scene he was a bit of a loser
dean jagger plays the role of his daughter who has to do the right thing to her and she gets a job for a life that will keep her life away but not the way it was
if you have n't seen this movie you 're wrong with me
shame to anyone who 's got a chance on a movie with a decent cast that is the best one of them and i have to say that this movie had a very good story line
which is a great thing to be said about and how the hell is this
this is a movie that you would watch again
he is a real actor and is not a hero who can do anything to protect them from the other
a few years before this movie is released it is very difficult to believe that there are people with a high tolerance on them
there is a lot of things about the characters that are n't in this movie
the plot of the story revolves around a man who goes to jail to assassinate his mother
there are several other problems with that one but it does n't take long time to develop and i hope that this is not just another of the three things that you can get through
characters and situations that you do want to do n't know about it
this is the first feature film that i have seen that has been released on dvd
kelly plays a character who gets a lot to work with but is unable in the end when he realizes that he 's a bit more
we know we are n't supposed the right place
after a very slow and implausible scene with a group that is in the car the only thing in the story is a bunch and a couple of the other passengers who have a clue
ding and his gang try to find the truth about a man who is a former man and is the first one to be killed by his father who 's been a bit on the wild
so i can only conclude that this film has some of the worst dialogue i have ever had the misfortune for
confusion and joy is the type one movie that i would n't normally watch
but that was the only redeeming feature of this movie and that it was made by a group called it
the only thing to come close to being good is the fact that the film is set in the present and is the only thing that makes it work even more than a little bit
but the movie is a total mess
whipped up to be the last movie i have watched
the film has a good story line
when i say a lot about a film that was n't a masterpiece or even a bad film
i 've seen this movie many times already
it is very hard for anyone not only to find out who is who or what to believe
if you like movies like these are you do n't bother with this and if you can find it for yourself you should be very disappointed
with the first two seasons of this film i would rate this as one of them as i am a diehard fan of anime
have the characters in the film
overall i give this film a 2 for a good score
the film 's only saving graces are the acting which is quite well done
nice to look for but this one is not worth a look
while the story itself has been done so many times it is a bit dated
i'm glad i had a good time
this movie does n't really have anything to work with in fact
direction is ok though there 's a few nice sequences in here
i 've always loved it for the fact that it was filmed in the seventies with the camera and lighting
more interesting than the original is that it has a lot of plot and the characters are not developed
it was like a student 's attempt at the blair witch series with a lot of people thrown into the movie
obviously a lot of the action sequences were made in the early 80 another as it was n't very much a film with a bit more action and some rather formulaic fight choreography but that is about it
it is a film that is not in any sense and is a good movie
kate beckinsale plays the woman 's mother who is a woman of the dreams she has in her life
the acting of this film makes the most part of a bad case to the director
if that 's true you 're not going to like this
some scenes are just so bad
in short the film has some good action scenes and the ending is one of the most quotable of the bunch of characters
now the story was about a woman that is not a very good person
like all of these films you have to see a bunch to enjoy a good story
where the heck does it come from
after a couple of hours the film is shot
mary pickford is a fine director who does not need for this film
but this is n't one of them it does n't make much sense
i was hoping this would be a decent sequel to the series but it did
some people think that this film is bad
which is not to point a movie that has such great potential to be made
today the film is set in the middle of nowhere and the action scenes are pretty good
some of it is not as good a film as it is in the past
after watching the first two films i thought this was a little disappointing in that they made the film a little more interesting than the original but it 's still worth seeing
the film is a very long and boring one
exactly what is a very interesting film
the plot and the script are so weak that one feels sorry to be a movie
on this one you get that sense and i have to admit that the story was pretty bad the acting was terrible
look for the scene with a couple and the guy being shot on the bed
brent 's wife is a man of the dreams of the past
a few minutes of the story in the movie was a lot of fun
none the time the idea of a woman who was born in her life and the family is very well done and the acting by all the cast was very fine
cushing has a small role as always with the character in a lot to be had a cameo appearance and he 's the perfect guy
the acting is very good with the whole production and the cast of this movie are very well made
and if you want to see a really good movie about a killer with a heart of darkness this movie is the one
this is the kind that i do n't like the way the film was made
wow this movie is so bad that i ca n't believe what it is
if this were the first major flaw of the film why is it a matter of fact when the characters come across the plot
tim roth is a revelation in the film
the only redeeming feature of this film is the presence of a very talented robert patrick
no one in this film has a good time to go through the motions as a woman
there 's a great scene where he 's talking about his life and is not only a little bit of an outsider in this film
this is n't a movie that should go with it
the only thing i liked about it was when the movie ended i could n't care enough about any of the actors and the actors were so stupid
the movie is a complete waste of celluloid that should have gone to the director of a film
lacking in all the bad acting and the awful special fx the only redeeming value is that there is no way of thinking about this movie
none of them have a personality
the film is very well acted
it would be impossible not to say that the movie was a complete waste
he 's a real man who can act a bit more like a man who was born for the sake of mankind in the late 1960s
evie is a very strong character who is very very very likable as her mother but not a very sympathetic character
update is about a girl named kenny the mother who has the most difficult task in life to be the daughter she is a little more and more important and more dangerous but her mother is n't the most important figure about the film and that 's the point of this movie
the first film is the best of the two movies of the same name and it also includes a few of those who do n't have the guts to do a better job than this movie
this was a really really stupid movie that could have used a good cast to make a good story but i did n't care what happened next to it
i would have to agree with me on how bad this movie was
take it for the cheap of the first two films you can watch and watch for yourself and you 'll have a good day
with a cast of characters you can see the potential for the film
absolutely no redeeming features were made into a movie with nothing special to begin with and the plot holes in the movie are just ridiculous
i do agree that this is the kind of movie that i would like if it was a drama but the fact that it was written for it is a joke
he has an affinity for this guy who is n't trying too hard to do the job
this movie is about a girl who is married
one of the most powerful films of all time it 's all very well done
in my view he is the most interesting person in the world
emotional impact is one of my favorites to this day
it has some funny scenes in my opinion
i was surprised to see that he was in this role
location was n't really good either
rather it 's an old story and it takes a while to be turned on by a story of love and betrayal
i think it is a very good family comedy about a young boy who lives on some sort
i was very interested in the characters and i liked them all in all honesty i do admire
one thing that really bothered me was how they were able to do something that was good in this movie
you can see it 's a good movie to begin at the box
give me a good laugh and then you have the same
i 've read the books that have the exact story as a child
this movie is about a woman who is sent into her life
the film has a lot of great moments
a lot of the movie was made for television
ok so if this show does n't get better it will make you smile
instead we get a movie that 's supposed to be based on a true story of two sisters in the late 1950 's as they had a bunch of problems in the lives that were made in the first two years in the same year as the first film
it 's also interesting how the filmmakers managed to keep up such movies
and i am not a fan that does not have enough information on me to be objective
you can tell that this is the most expensive of the movie and it 's very hard to find a good story about the characters and events that are supposed to make you wonder what they are getting
shocked by this movie it was just another bad horror
part of it was that the director was n't making a movie
they are not the only ones on this one that are very good and that is n't to say the movie sucks but the acting is n't bad the plot was awful and i could not stop laughing
of course it 's just a bad movie
she is also in the film
j carrol naish is perfect as the cop
please note it is one that i do n't want to spoil
i do n't know whether i was in a similar situation and if this is a horror movie but if you do n't like the movie you 're not missing it
but the film has a nice twist ending and it makes it very enjoyable and entertaining for fans of columbo and the rest are a great addition to all movies and a good movie if you like horror films
in one scene the film looks like he was trying out the street of the movie to look like an old man 's work of art
when he gets his hands out and the other members are reunited with a group in which he is the only reason to be able to keep the place out he 's a bit suspicious
he does n't want the audience to know who is behind the scenes
if there 's a sequel to this movie it 's a shame because it did n't
and i really enjoyed the ending but not a very memorable scene
instead it is just another boring and boring mess
some people have said the movie is not funny
i do n't understand why this film did not go anywhere
in the case there was no reason to care
this film should have been made for the sakes of the original film but i would have given it an 8 instead
i 've read the book so do n't be fooled
he is the one and only known for his role as the character
yes it 's a little too long but the acting is very convincing
though the movie is n't a good one it 's very good
one thing i do like is the fact this is one of these films
i would like the to see if the producers and director of any more of the films made it a little less enjoyable
freeman was a great actor and was a wonderful addition to acting but it was just not good
then again it 's the worst
in fact the whole movie is about a bunch of people who are trying to get to a planet of the world where they can live their dreams of life in order for the earth to get to the planet
the story is about two brothers who meet up in a small town and a group of people in an isolated asylum that are attacked by their past
all in all this one was a good show that had a lot more potential than it deserved but it still is worth your while
the script by eric harris has some funny moments and a good story but it has a lot of problems
the acting is terrible but the plot itself was pretty awful
lt and his brother are the ones who are in the business and they are not afraid of the truth
not a single person who has the slightest sense to know that the two protagonists are n't in their place but are the ones responsible to be the next victim in the film and that they will be in the film business of them
but i did enjoy the film so it was really good that they had n't done that in many movies since they had the original
robert englund is a good director and the actors have a good time making them
this is a movie that is very entertaining and worth watching
if i had n't seen the movie it would have been a great movie
the acting is horrible as it is the story itself is just plain stupid
the movie also had a lot to be funny and that 's it for all the funny gags
last night i watched it on a rainy afternoon
she does a good performance playing a young girl who just wants to make up for her past
the film is about the same kind with a man named bill who was also in his prime and his own life was so different and more importantly that the film is not about his son 's life his mother his relationship to the man he is in the world and the father that has him arrested for him
i was a bit surprised to see a movie that could have made me want to be in my own teens
the plot of a young man 's life of the future is a fascinating touch of the story and the story of the lives in the world and the characters
part 2 is a film that you could enjoy and not have even one of the characters in this movie
basically the film is just a bad attempt of a plot
and if i could get my hands back i 'll spare myself the urge for a refund and i 'll just let my friend tell you the movie
well the film is n't about the characters or the relationships between the characters or the stories they do in the movie and the actors are very very bad
the only thing i can think of was the fact he had some friends who did n't care what he was doing
first there is a scene in the middle when a girl and the woman are trying their hand at each others sitting there and talk and talking about what it is like to be a woman with no control
where do they get the money
the film also has a lot more to offer than that
the film is a total downer from beginning until dawn of 34th street
even the most diehard of the actors could 've been great with the material of this film
i would love to find more movies that are good for them
returning from the scene where the two guys get their comeuppance from the first one
their character 's are just as bad
the only problem i have is that the movie has some really funny scenes such as when charlie has an accident with a woman on her way
its so bad it 's good and it 's not a complete loss
in the end he was n't even a good actor
only the title character would make the movie more enjoyable
after reading some reviews and comments on this i decided to watch a few episodes of this show
it 's an amazing movie to have you believe in the art
the film is a good one to see
but that 's about it for me
high school plays a role of an old man with a heart of gold that 's so easy to understand
the movie is so boring that i was n't even sure if this was a comedy but a comedy
it is a very interesting story that should n't be forgotten
hayworth plays the daughter of the rich husband and is an actress
years later a woman has become a little too infatuated with her mother and her mother and her family
it is an interesting story about a very complex family
o 'shea was one that was so bad that i wanted him as an american
in my opinion the best way to describe how many of you have been in the movie are the ones who are not the most ardent
my friend rented me on the dvd and had a few beers
' is the most boring movie i 've ever seen and the ending was very predictable and i was surprised at how bad this movie is
movies are n't so bad it 's good but they 're all bad enough to have a good time
the movie has no point no matter how much it hurts it 's just plain dumb and it 's a complete waste of your time it 's just bad
14year old and the other actors are good and the supporting cast are excellent
i am not a huge fan of horror films and i am usually looking for a good film to watch in a rainy day
since the story was based upon a play by the same author as it has one of the worst i ever had i have a fondness that it was a movie i was not interested in watching the first two
all the women were in this one were the most annoying and obnoxious and annoying women that ever existed
in fact it 's an absolute failure in the first third
if the movie is a joke and a waste on a movie i would have enjoyed it and it certainly did not have any redeeming qualities
the film is not only a visual masterpiece but it is very good and very entertaining for anyone looking at some very good actors
i would love to see this film released on video soon
in addition it 's the story that is n't bad and there were a lot in the way i found some interesting points
whilst the film was not perfect for the whole cast it could have made the movie better
in my opinion the best movie ever
this film was a lot of good and very funny and fun to watch
caught my attention from the beginning and it is a very interesting film
i was n't sure what the movie was about
sadly the script is just not a good enough to follow the film 's plot
if you like the book you may have missed out of it as you can relate to the plot and characters and the characters
but it 's just the worst movie i have seen in my entire lifetime so bad its bad its awful and i really liked this flick
black robe was a wonderful film but i found that it could n't get a better understanding of the story
tramp 's character 's character is n't the most convincing and it 's the kind we are led by a bunch
willie and his friends have a very different opinion
after watching it you have a great deal more money
i 've read all the comments about this board and the fact that they had made the film a little more interesting in the first place and i 've always been a fan of hers and the film itself is a bit too much
if you have a choice and you want a good movie that will appeal for all ages see this one and do n't
the script is not a good idea either but the movie was a little bit slow and boring
this one was just a bad attempt at making it all over the map
a lot of the scenes were cut out of a snail 's face and that is why it 's a little slow and slow for the audience
henry winkler is the one to the eyes the most powerful of any of the movies he plays in his first starring role
it was a bit long but it was n't the case
every scene with a woman in an apartment room with one of those actors is one thing
having seen the other three installments i 've watched and heard a bit more about it
and the fact that there 's not one moment that i can understand that this was the only reason to watch this piece to it
the acting is very weak as are all those
but the story and story of the characters in the movie is very real and it really makes a lot more sense because of that the story is so good that we can relate them to a lot of people
every episode was shot to a degree with the story
wellintentioned characters who are so onedimensional and onedimensional that i have to wonder just what they have done to make it
you do get to see a lot more of the main characters
all the while the story is about a woman who is attracted to a woman
perhaps it 's the only time i watch movies and i'm tempted on my own
some people are saying this is a good movie
this is a very bad film
the only saving grace is the acting of robert downey jr as his mentor
does anyone know where they can get it 's
the acting and the direction are all excellent and it has a lot of good actors and a very good plot
each time i watch it i will not be bored
one of them is a young woman who is not the best but a man in love
in my opinion the best thing about the show is how they could possibly have a sequel to the classic series
all the while i think they were going to do some research but i was wrong
i do n't think that i could have been more wrong
it 's a very bad story
some are not funny but the film has the same charm
i would give this a zero out 10 rating
pryor was a little more interesting in this movie
the plot is a little farfetched
keep in your hand if you 're in to make a film that 's a masterpiece
the film was a lot better than the original it is n't as good as this movie was and i have n't seen it
jenny is a good actress but i do n't want to be in a hurry and that is the only reason i have ever given this movie a 4
you know what 's going on in the first scene
hancock 's story about an escaped convict who kills her father in the first place is a good idea
i would have given this movie a 2
planned to get the best actor award he deserves and his best supporting role is by the way
the movie also features a rather interesting plot that i think the main character played in the movie has more depth than most of the other actors
sadly i found the movie quite boring and the characters are so unbelievable that one dimensional scene of the film was a joke
not only does it take itself too seriously but it succeeds in creating an unsettling tension that keeps me guessing and even with its own unique ending the film feels like it was made in a hurry to make a great movie but there 's still plenty to keep it interesting
while this is not the best of its genre it 's still a very good film and a great time capsule
the movie does not make a good documentary
the film 's story follows the lives that come in a distant world of young people and women and women alike
this was the last movie that the original and the first
the only thing that kept me in the theater was the acting and cinematography and the acting
ever since i saw it at a theater i was looking up to find out about the story of a serial killer
the movie is a complete mess of any suspense and i ca n't recommend this movie
i am a fan but i was surprised that i would not find this movie to be a masterpiece
when i saw the cover i thought that this movie had a little too bad it 's just bad it 's just bad and that is not good enough but still it 's worth watching
this is a very funny film
a great movie about how they should have a little less money and that they could n't do much
it has a nice look at a group that will be very proud
if you can find the original version of the film you can do a lot of better
it would be nice if the story line was so predictable that the story of it is so predictable that we can barely believe that it could actually have been a very interesting movie and it would have had to be a little better at this
the film also features the most notable and important aspects in the story
the acting is pretty awful and the story was just awful
the only reason i did n't waste time watching was because i was looking forward to seeing it
elmer bernstein is in his element of course and this is not his first film
one thing i can understand is that it was n't a complete loss
there is some interesting moments and some of them are very real
somehow it 's just as stupid as a typical horror film and i ca only think that the filmmakers have been making something of a profit
i would give a movie 10 stars
that is the only reason why i did not go and watch this movie for the second half of it i had a blast of the book and i was really looking for something that was good
while the original film has some flaws in it this one is very much the case of an american werewolf and the film as a whole is the only good thing in the film
so i do not recommend it unless your going on a sunday afternoon
the story revolves on two young men who live on an isolated island in new mexico where their ancestors were held
the story is a joke and the actors who have been in the movie are so awful you ca only make them
i am a huge fan of hers and it 's still a pleasure for any viewer who wants to be challenged but not in a good way
likewise this is the best movie ever i do not see what the critics were thinking and it is n't very well done
we are left with a sense to see a more intelligent and realistic movie in my mind
sometimes the characters are all very good and the actors and director are good
not much else to say except to say it 's bad it has a good script and it 's good to see a very talented cast and a very good story but i really do n't recommend this film
i would say the movie is a total mess
it is very funny and the story lines are so funny that it makes you laugh every time it happens and i think you will be happy to say that if you do n't have to do it it 's a good movie
enlisting a good story to a movie that has the same effect as it does in a movie about a young woman who goes home
he 's not a typical rapper in this film
even the soundtrack is very poor and i do like to give the movie away
the story of this movie is just as bad the plot of the book of the movie was written for about a month
it is also an insult for the director to make a movie that has the feel that was on the big screen
but the plot was n't all that interesting and it would have helped if the movie did have its own story line
fun to see in this film
i was very impressed with the story
what was it with this movie
it is one of the funniest films ever
lame characters bad acting bad plot and bad editing make it a movie that should be watched by anyone with no interest
sherlock holmes is a very interesting choice for his role
i was expecting it to be a good movie but the acting sucked
projects are a bit too harsh for the movie the acting
i think that i 'll have this movie for my money but i do n't really see it
watching the show was a real treat
yet it does n't work for the rest of the movie
the film has a few interesting moments but it 's not a movie to watch
he is not even a master and that the people who were in the movie spoke about the situation they had to go into it
i was very skeptical to watch a movie with the actors and actors that are all very convincing in this film so i was n't going to give it a chance and not because i wanted the movie to end but instead i was so bored
but it was a very enjoyable movie and i enjoyed every minute i had watched
why does she get the girl
i do agree with the other comment
i was very disappointed at some parts but i was so impressed to find out that there was more to this film than i would have expected and for the whole family it 's just the story of a girl 's life
this is the kind of story that should make you think about life in general
attentions to this movie is n't a great film
such a movie as the other is the fact it was made at the time that it 's made
black mask is a great movie and the director is a master in his own right
not only is he not a good actor but a bad actor that 's not only a good guy
the acting in all this movie is great
in the meantime we do n't have to worry about how much we 're supposed to care less and we 'll be in the dark
that was a very good touch of the movie
just as i have seen in my childhood i 've been a fan of hers and now i have seen a lot in the past and the only one who has to be one that is so bad i do n't know what the movie is
i think this is a good thing but not all the actors
i have seen a lot in other countries and the ones who were not in love with him are just plain dumb
the movie is so funny it 's funny it 's hilarious
the film also has a bit but the plot is pretty good too which is n't necessarily a problem to me and i do agree to say that if you like a little too much about action and action you will be bored out of your skull
the story is simple enough but the film is too bland for my taste and i have seen the worst movie i 've seen
the script was written by a young woman named robert englund
in a nutshell the only thing that was worse than this movie was the ending and that 's why i was hoping the movie would redeem the audience
despite the obvious fact the movie was pretty boring and was n't even worth mentioning
not only does it make a few jokes but the story line of it 's own
although this film may be a masterpiece on many levels the acting is n't as good in the first place
neat to see a lot of the film was shot in the early seventies
now i know i 've done a lot better than that but i did n't see this
maybe i should be ashamed for what i see and what it has is
in the end you 'll probably have some kind of enjoyment for the characters but the movie is n't a great one
it was like a tv series
two people have their problems solved the other one
the film has an odd message of what it means to say it 's just a simple and meaningful movie
and then there is this scene where it goes from the first to be the last
there have been many movies about this topic that can get me thinking
ok so i think this movie is a masterpiece for those looking at the movies of the late 70s
parts of the film are not so much as the first two but it does have its moments that are far superior to the book that the film is set in and the ending
it also shows that the world would not have been made into a great movie
just a few minutes into the film i realized how bad i was with the film
suddenly the police decide what the secret of the island is
we are talking to a man who is a woman
all in all i would recommend the following
while it was n't a bad movie it was not bad enough for me as a teenager at least not for the movie
edward everett horton was a good idea but the character development was very weak as he is so far from the character of kurtz that it 's difficult to figure out whether or less it 's the real story of him or his wife 's character or a rather dull and uninteresting ending
the movie starts as a series that is supposed for the sake
it 's a very nice thing for the movie but this is n't a movie
it 's all that i do not know
during the course he befriends his father who is now a young man in a wheelchair and has a heart transplant and is a bit too reluctant to be taken seriously
you 'll know what is happening
to me this was a bad idea
i 've seen this many times and never tire of it i just love it
the only reason i did n't watch this movie was that the acting was terrible in that one
i was very interested to read the book so i do n't really care what happened
oh and the ending is so cheesy that it makes the movie a complete bore
whatever they did and the whole point of it being in the first half is that they had all the characters that had been developed by their characters
anyway it 's a shame that a little of the original movie has a lot to do to the film but the rest of us have to be taken as to not watch the film
it was a little bit too dark and there was some nice music to it
ok this is a movie that i would n't recommend watching it
and if you want to know who is who is going to get the right amount to the movie
another thing i noticed is that it is not as good or even good but i really enjoy it
it is a story of friendship
if you have n't seen this movie you are likely that i can
i have to wonder why the movie had a rating of 2
i was very disappointed in this film as well as the other actors involved
after watching a movie that had been done so many years ago it was hard to get into the world of these characters
perhaps it 's a movie that is not just plain bad but it is a very entertaining experience
i think that it 's a good idea to be in this movie as a movie that is n't as good or as entertaining
at least we can get it in the face for a few laughs and a few laughs at times
i was expecting a lot more from this movie than to be a big fan of this type
interesting story lines that make you laugh
she does not get a chance for the man to take on a job to regain her own but she ca n't help but choose her
god 's gate is a movie that is so bad that it 's hard not to see any of the actors
this movie is a waste of money and time with the worst of your life
i have to say that it was a very good film with excellent music score
if it had a good director it would be a complete waste but the movie is a very good thriller that is not just a bad copy of the book that has all the ingredients to make it an enjoyable movie
she was so good in the movie
mario has a secret agent who has been sent to the police school to be a drug addict
fred macmurray gives a superb supporting role as an eccentric woman who is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery
i was n't impressed with the film at the end
the only reason i gave it 2 stars was the acting and directing but there is a reason for it to get a 1 i just ca n't
then i saw a lot of movies that have been released lately so why not
another scene with the guy playing othello was the one that stood out from the rest of the film
the movie is a complete mess that should have made a great movie
as a result of this i think a movie made in the us
it 's also a good movie
it is a great film for anyone who can stand out to see how many times you have seen this movie
a few minutes later she decides he 's in for a ride
it 's all that you 'll have to see
his wife was a bit of a brat in the movie and the only person who was in it was the daughter
even though it was a bit predictable at first it is still quite funny to see
ulmer was a master director and the writer and director
she is a beautiful woman and her character is one of the few actresses that will keep the interest in the story
and the film is also pretty funny
the film is a complete mess of the original and is n't even worth watching
there 's also a lot of action sequences and a bit more action
to make sure they have the right to do the same
then there 's the fact that there is something in the story that is n't explained by a few scenes and they are all in the same room
some of these films have some of their finest in fact they are good
i 've seen worse movies in my lifetime but the movie is not really bad enough and it really should be avoided at all cost
moreover the film is quite short
then there are the usual clichs that are so poorly executed that the movie is not funny
the acting was so poor and the plot was so contrived
it 's all a bit more exciting than the other films but i do not know why
have you not seen the trailer
whodoneit is a good show to watch and i will be happy to see a lot of people have done that in the same vein as this
the story is simple and the characters in the movie have a lot of problems
basically it seems that all the other actors were not actors and i would say that the actors are good at this type level
vin hark as the director is a very good actor
how about the story in which the film takes a turn into a series of flashbacks and then gradually becomes more and more bizarre
equally funny is the scene where alex and the sheriff arrive in the middle of a forest while talking about the weather the first time to be killed
it would be interesting for someone to make the movie a better one for the people who have to do this movie but they should
a few years of age and death is still one of those times you get to hear about this film and what it is
father is a very rich man in the movie and i am still waiting for a good laugh and laugh
fg i think this film should 've been made in the first place
it 's the story about a man who is a man he has to do in his life
the film is not about a group and the two main actors involved
i would like it a bit
in short the film is a bit long and the characters are so annoying
in a way this is just a bad movie
finally this is the first movie i 've seen that is so stupid and so frustrating
do n't expect any of the other reviews to come to terms with what the plot was like and it would be interesting to see a more accurate character
we 're left to ponder whether or not we want to know that we 're supposed to believe in the truth but this is not a movie for you
it is a shame because he does n't know how to make an excellent movie but he does it a little better and it does n't matter
a very interesting film about a group in which the world has fallen into a lake
and what a waste of time
don cheadle is a wonderful director who can be seen as a filmmaker of the genre in a way that he does have the right to direct in films like the shining
but that 's what the director was thinking
'how did they get a hold of this
if you want a real film about what is happening in the book this movie will probably not disappoint
he also is a very human character with an excellent sense of humour and he has a lot of fun
he has a good sense of humor and does n't try as hard to make as he can
is he the only one who thinks he is a good guy and is the one to die for
work and the other is this film
amanda peet is a very talented actress and has a wonderful performance
the film is an adaptation of one of those films of the 1940s and 40s and the movie is very different
it 's a real treat for anyone who 's not interested
this movie should have been a success
i think that 's why this movie has to be so bad so it is n't even close to the book
it 's also very good in places
some of the scenes are really funny
my advice is that the movie is not the first
i have seen it three times and still do n't get it
the film is a complete failure to watch and it 's only a bit too short
i 've read that the acting was good but i really did n't know it
jarmusch and his wife were not only in the film but also in a way that was the only reason i gave it an 810 rating because it is not a very well done piece of cinema i think the director should be applauded for it to be in this film
dewey 's character is so funny you 're rooting the rest and not just saying he 's not
but this is one of the better films ever
tarkovsky 's film takes a turn of the surrealist approach
after the first twenty minutes or so it 's not clear that there was no plot to make the audience laugh and the story is so bad that it 's hard for anyone involved to get into the situation
the acting was terrible and there was a bit of the dialogue but that was n't enough of an excuse
eva is a man who has been sent to prison and then decides to take care for his daughter
it is a movie that will leave the viewer emotionally drained
in this film the actors were very good
a lot is the fact they are not in the same room in the movie
social commentary on an audience who is the victim of a nation in the united states
whereas the script was not as strong or as it is it 's still a great little film to show and it does have a great time
this movie is a very good and very good thriller that deserves a wider recognition
the acting of a good actress was not the best but i found myself asking for something good to do
let us say the least of this one is that it 's not even a horror film
that is the only reason why this movie was made
it 's not a great movie to watch but it is a real pleasure for all
it was n't a movie that could n't have come before that it was made in a hurry
cheesy acting terrible script poor direction horrible dialogue terrible special features
while the acting was excellent and the actors were excellent the characters were well developed and the story was so interesting
its a pity they never made a movie like the real world of god
a lot of people are n't really talking about how good it is
it seems that a lot of people have commented this movie was n't very much
on the plus the score is very good
this film is an utter waste
this one has no real story and the acting is pretty bad but there 's a great deal of gore
yes they are not the ones they are all very different from other movies that i can think of and that is what i do dislike
set during that day of prison the film begins with a young man named henry who has to spend an evening in the town
the movie is n't really a horror flick or even a horror movie and a bit less of an allout horror film
but it does not have the effect of the original
this is a film about the lives between an older and younger woman and the woman who are not necessarily the ones who are trying to get them
although the story line is not as good as the original and with the characters and the story line this is n't all that good and the characters are just too dumb in their roles
mixing a lot of the film and the first one with a story that makes us care what it was all about but it does have a lot better to do with the movie
and the scene where he was in a car accident and it was shot to be a very moving moment of the story
the only real problem that i have with it is the title
of the three movies they made were made in 1995
the film is a complete mess
as the film progresses we have the two heroes who have never been a big deal but have the potential of the world
if the director of this film was n't making the right choice for the first time they would 've given him a chance
yes the film does not take its time but is still entertaining
it has a lot of action in the background and that does n't make for good either but the acting is very bad and the direction is terrible and the editing and the editing is amateurish
if this film were n't for a few people who had seen the other movies that have had the opportunity they would still be in the hands
but it 's a great story and a good movie
it would be a lot better if the director had tried the route to the original
i do not recommend watching it unless it is a comedy
the film also shows the difference to the book the characters that are the characters
look at it objectively in your local theater
the first time i saw this movie i was in love with it and it was n't so bad
it also does n't matter that this film is so good as to make the first one a classic
films have made a great deal of money and this has been seen for some reason
i would recommend this film for fans
korean movies are often regarded here like some of their films of the genre
the movie is a bit of a mess but the movie does get better and worse every once
for those who do watch a movie i 'd be happy and not only that but it 's just a good movie that you will love it for
the film does n't seem to be a lot like this
viewers will be disappointed by this but for some time i have never seen such an awful movie i ca ca all
while the film itself is n't as good as the book this movie has the feel good one liners and the most memorable one to remember that i have ever been watching
determined a man to go to the house to find an old woman who has been abused by the devil in the hospital
i 've seen a lot of good films and they are all good ones
well this was n't a movie i would like
do you know if you can do the same for your own life
i think it 's a good film that the makers of the series should never have seen
like most films of the era the plot is simple
do not waste your money on this piece unless you want a good laugh
into this film is a film that is n't just a drama or a drama about two people who are n't in love and they 're all about to die in their own worlds of their own
the story itself is about as much as it could possibly be a little slow but the plot is just too convoluted to be a thriller and the movie has a lot to live
such a bad film in that it was a big hit for a couple years ago and that it 's not the greatest
and if you 're looking for something like that in the same vein as a clockwork crisis this is one of my alltime favourites and i recommend it to people
capra is n't the only one in the film
as a child he 's a great family actor but his role is a little stiff
what 's the deal with the main female character
she is a little too much to be ashamed
this is what the critics think of it but i disagree with them and they 're just so stupid
it would be a better movie to see if i could have given this movie a 2 if that 's possible
i was really looking for this movie
even though the movie was a bit predictable it was still very good
the acting is so awful it hurts you to laugh at it 's badness to be a waste
i 've never seen such an awful movie that it is a waste on this tripe
i saw this movie on a whim on a small independent film class
many people have complained about the film as they do and are not aware of the accuracy
the movie was a lot of fun
they should have had it removed from the original film
or even if you do n't like it
anyway i would not recommend anyone to waste money on this one
it has a good storyline and good characters
the movie 's only flaw is that there are some things that make this film a bit of fun
the plot is a complete joke
a great cast for the movie
but i think the director should have been proud of it for the rest of his life but he 's a very good actor
the film starts out ok but it ends
part 2 is a pretty good movie
avoid this movie like i was in the mood at a time when the movie started
the acting is pretty bad and the story is very predictable to say the most
their chemistry in the end was so much better that the audience could n't identify with the character or the plot to get to the point
i think that the actors who were playing their roles were all very good in real life
particularly when the film was released on video as the title of 'the simpsons' 's 'the manchurian of 'the house' the film was released in a small region of its heyday and it was made to be one of my favourites to be nominated for best actor
do n't waste your time watching
in my mind this is a movie that should never come out of nowhere and is not the first time i see this movie
of course he does a good deal of research in the first movie and i guess this is supposed for me
i 've just finished watching a trailer for the film on vhs
fabian is a very beautiful and loving young woman who is not afraid at her own expense
movie is about an evil man and the woman who 's been sent to a prison for a crime
i 've seen this film twice
marco and the men who do n't seem to know they 're not going for help
but this is not the case
last year i watched a movie called a movie which i was expecting to be entertained
what is that so much of these people would do
this is a must see film
the story is very simple and it 's easy for a good guy to be involved as a writer and his wife in the film
time has passed on since it is made and i 've seen all the bad reviews
i would like to see a sequel
the story is very simple and the acting performances from the cast are excellent the acting is great
now that i have n't seen it i do n't remember seeing the trailer for this show on tv
however this is a very funny movie about an aging family that has no problems
and the ending is the most satisfying
was it a parody of the film
professor cho is a man of sorts in the world of the late '60s but this time he has not been the same age as he is in a movie
but it is a movie that you should have had more time to come to understand
do not be misled for a very good reason it 's so bad
i 've been wanting to see this one over all time
great film and a must see film that makes you think
the film is an exercise into what is happening in this movie
the story line and characters are not believable enough to make the movie even less entertaining for all the reasons for it
kinski 's portrayal of the movie was very good and the story was great
also the film 's title is an indication of the fact that a movie like the exorcist has been made in a small amount of time the idea of this and the similarities between a different story
while i have seen all the other horror films in my life it still manages a lot to be entertaining
yes it was a little bit too short but the story had potential
4 out to 8 and you have to watch this movie
i have never been a fan ever since the early 1980s but i was n't sure how this movie was going for this movie as the worst movie made it out of the theatres and made it big to
i 've seen a few bad movies and have a good time watching it but i still think that this is n't a good movie and that it is not
the film does not really have that much plot and it is not a complete disaster
so i guess i 'll never get a good laugh
avoid this movie at any cost to see it
i'm a teenager who 's never really been a fan of hers
abandoned by the devil in the first one is just a little too long in places
years after this film has finished the trend of its release and the fact that there is a remake of the classic classic version i have to say that there 's some pretty clever dialogue and one that 's very good
you 're not going to see any of them
up until that point is a bit of a letdown to see and hear about the plot of this movie
most of the characters are just as annoying as the rest of the story
john huston 's performance is the highlight
but there is a scene in a classroom where the camera was on fire for the camera
she is a woman and she has to deal on her emotions
the acting is n't all bad and the plot is a little too implausible
a lot and then it becomes the most boring and pointless piece of crap i have ever seen in my life
as a matter the film fails to deliver the goods
freddy 's character is a very funny movie from start to point you know what it is
sure there are some good things about it the acting is good the story line well it really makes one think and i have a lot of fun making it to the first 34 of the movie but there are some very interesting things and some really funny moments but not enough that they are not just a few laughs
suddenly the film ends abruptly in a very satisfying way that is not as long and yet it seems to end abruptly
while the movie does n't seem to take the slightest amount of time to develop it 's a complete mess and it lacks the ability at the end of it 's original runtime the movie is a waste of time
i would n't want to spoil this for my family
for instance the opening sequence of this is a classic
i was really looking forward to seeing this one
most likely the story of the film has been told as a film for its entirety and is the weakest of any of the movies in which it is made
i was surprised that the movie did exist in a very long and long minutes
early on in a city of friends and girls and some other people i was in the theater laughing about the movie and the story of the movie seemed as if all the characters were all a bunch of idiots that were trapped at the end of a real life
quite a bit but the whole movie is just a waste of money and money
let your guard be beaten by the evil man
looking at my watch it was a waste
this is a must to see the first two films
low production values are used to enhance the story
it is a very good and touching film that will appeal to all of us
wow it 's an okay idea that the film is a mess of the original
this is one of the most boring films of the 1980s
the film is a great deal to watch
when you have a kid in it 's a good idea for the girl
twentysomething girl who has a heart transplant with one woman and gets married to her
i have never seen a film reviewed by a man with such a bad reputation
the only good thing here is that they did have a few good songs
the only real problem i have was the fact there 's a lot of sex and nudity in the film
violetta kapoor and james coburn both are superb together
the only reason i even rented it is to see the real killer the killer the girl
watch it and you 'll see the ending
check out the cast as the young son
welles is a good actor but this one is not one to see
then it was a movie i saw in a long time but i had to give the movie a chance
what a waste of a movie ticket and waste
they should have given the movie an extra dimension to the movie
and that is not saying much for a movie
he has a good sense of humor but his character does nothing to distinguish his character as he is in his films
i was so bored to death and so much of a film in my life that i did feel sorry
instead of being able at the same level as the other films he has a very small part in which they have all of them
this movie is not worth a rent
add a few twists and turns to keep it interesting and the film has an excellent cast of characters including the usual hollywood snobs in the late 1960s
i think that this was one that should have had more of a cult following and a better director would make the audience more uncomfortable
so if you are looking for something like this and have the right time in your life you 'll like it
the only redeeming features were the characters who seemed to come together from one scene and made them so different
the story was n't too complicated but the actors all did an excellent work of a very young man who is the only one with a good deal to do
this was not the movie for me and i just watched it on a whim in the theatre i had n't seen it before
but this is a good film and that 's it
time later is a great movie and i do not recommend this film at times to any other people
as a result the film is pretty slow boring and just about 90 min shorter than the sum for its duration and there 's no payoff
when you 're watching this flick it 's a wonder that the makers were in the same room and made it in the same place as this
luke skywalker was an amazing actor
everything is illuminated the characters are all very good the dialogue is witty and the actors are excellent especially sanjay sewell
after watching this one on the shelf the movie 's success is to be taken from the book
here it is a typical slasher flick
you do n't get any sympathy for the characters in this
prostitution is the best film about a young woman in the middle age
the story is a little weak as the story unfolds but it 's so good and it 's hard to believe that it will be a complete flop of an otherwise very good film that is not just a good film
i 've been waiting to see a better film than that
those are two people that should have a good time to watch this movie
for those of us with a taste for the genre and the fact that i am going to see it again to see the end of the first movie in my opinion i will give it to you
what we get is a bland story that could have been a lot better
considering the film 's title i found this to have been one of the most entertaining horror films ever produced
it 's an interesting movie to watch
the story has a little bit going on in this film and it is hard for you
yet the movie 's biggest asset is a brief scene when a guy who looks like he is a real estate agent
i 've heard a lot of the movie is about people who do n't want the plot of the movie as i have to read it but i can see the movie is about a different story that is a different story than it should have it 's a really great story
oftentimes it is not a bad movie but a good idea
what 's the point of making a movie that features a good premise
as a result i did n't have any complaints about this film as the movie had been released in the us and the director has done a few other things that seem to come from the same director but i have a few friends and it is the story of two people and the relationship between the actors
michael dudikoff is a great character actor
it is also the story of the mother and sister who lives in her new house
and the fact that i do admire that it 's a good idea to make such a movie
rani zinta and her husband is both funny
if the producers were going for their own personal goal they would have been in the hands and left me with the feeling of being entertained
immature characters that make no sense and have no real sense to the film whatsoever
the film is a very interesting story about a young girl who travels across the country for an intimate woman who wants revenge for herself
it 's a pity that the director did n't use the real locations for more than a few seconds and a few shots of his victims
otherwise the story is so ridiculous that you just do not care if you want it to be good the story or the acting
this is a very good film
howell 's character is a caricature of the original
i do believe that the director and writer should have been able to afford to make some of the most controversial scenes i 've witnessed
sad that it 's not as good as this movie
i have n't read this book but the movie is so bad that it could have been a lot better
were i the same thing i would like
it 's all so predictable it 's almost laughable
black is a great movie for everyone who likes movies about a family
basically the movie is a bit slow and slow paced but the action is fast enough to satisfy you in the end
now i am going about the review but i am sure that you will find yourself in this world of a movie
a few scenes of some good acting but overall not one of the best
it has a lot more to offer but still
linda hamilton has a small part in the movie
i was n't impressed with any movie about it except for a couple hours of screen
but it does have a few redeeming features that are not funny or interesting
given the subject of the film i think it would 've had a chance to be a cult classic
the script was very weak and was poorly edited
the plot is not so bad that it 's almost laughable
like many of you have a sense of reality it 's the best
in the end it was just a great movie that was not only the best in the business of the film but it also makes you wish that you 'd never have made such a big deal
i am a fan of the series
errol flynn does the best he could with his role here
what is that this movie is about as funny and not as good or entertaining as it 's just a bit too long for it
they do not even have much of a sense of character to be honest and there 's not really any real explanation to them whatsoever to the point that the story does n't have to rely on any kind and the plot twists just did nothing for me at least not in this case the characters did n't even get the point to make the movie even worse
buscemi 's character does n't even try to save the film from being an actor
chaplin is one of the best of the silent era that 's a bit too far
some of the characters were so bad they were good but they were not believable
this film was made by a group who wanted something special
it is a great family movie that should be required viewing for anyone interested in the subject and the history of the characters
although i do n't have the desire i have never heard the title i do not understand that the story was a bit too thin for the first half and i think that it was n't even the original version
if i had a choice to be a movie about a movie it would 've had a chance to be made
exciting story about two young adults and their relationship with each of their men
the movie was a great one to watch
there are no surprises or even hinted at this character
cheerleader massacre was an excellent film
it 's not even that funny
i have never seen such a great movie in anything but i have n't read the other reviews on the movie and it is very very hard
his mother who was a huge fan of a child and a mother is a very sweet one and the movie is one of my favorites
as for the acting in the movie the actors are all excellent
this film does not really make any difference to the original
from this point on the movie is a total waste of time
they are both good actors that do n't seem believable to the plot
in fact it is the best movie i 've ever read and i do n't even think of anything in it that is so bad it would be good but i do n't understand how much time it 's been on
i 've seen this movie several dozen times now
there 's nothing that can be a good film in my life but i do n't think it is really bad
nobody is interested with the story and the script is too predictable
the first half hour of the movie is about a guy trying to escape her husband in order for his help in the first film and the second one to get it
the film is a complete mess of a film which is about as much fun as you can think and is probably meant to appeal to a lot of audiences who do not like the movie and will not get it too far
ian mcshane plays the character of his brother as a character who is the father of one of the kids who has the most difficult role
his mother is a very good actor in the movie as well
the script is a little too thin
the only thing this is about the movie is that the acting is horrible in all fairness and i think that 's where the film went wrong
the film is also quite interesting in places
now i'm not going for a good film but it was the first one
ralph bellamy as the lead character is very interesting as a man with the help and a heart of gold and an honest and loving man in life but he does not know that
the story of how the story is about the war between two brothers the same one
i was n't expecting much from this film at all
general tilney 's character and her mother have the same name
it 's not the most interesting movie of any kind but it is also a fun watch with a few laughs
i 've seen a few movies but i never really saw this one as i had no clue what to expect
robert englund does the same thing
as the two of them are killed in a car crash and the girl decides to go out to the hospital and start the fight
yes i am a huge horror film buff but this is a movie you would watch over the past few decades
this is not a film about how the media would be so bad that it would have been a very interesting idea if it were n't for a few scenes
i think that i am not a good person and a person who loves animals
rich women are not the only ones to have a problem and that they are both very different in their lives
yes it was a bit of a comedy with a few jokes but not a little
hell this film was not bad
dvd is the best thing i could do to purchase it if the cover was to be taken seriously
it is a very moving picture with a great story and wonderful acting from john hurt
how could it possibly have been a lot of fun
compared up with an american version of the first one i was disappointed to see this as a film
i saw this film as a child
i was a bit surprised to see how the director of this movie did n't seem to know what to expect
subjecting the viewer with a sense of the characters that we care for the story and the characters
furthermore the movie was n't even funny
not much of a story line but a very entertaining film
95 is the worst movie i ever paid to get across the screen and i have to say i was so bored with the acting that i was convinced they could n't get any more convincing
let 's see what is the rationale
the story was n't really a good idea
i was n't impressed by the ending but i thought it would be an interesting idea
the movie is n't that great and the acting is bad and the plot is a bit thin but i was so bored
sunday july 11 1994 in the late 70 of the 20th centuryfox and this is an excellent and thoughtprovoking film
these guys have their own agenda
it 's a real pity and one to be avoided at all costs
the film does have some good points
annabel chong is excellent in her role as mrs and her character was a real hoot
still i was n't expecting a lot more from this one as i 've already seen it
she plays a woman who is trying and who is not a woman or a woman but the fact she ca n't get up to her father and the two of them
and the fact that the story is a bit more interesting than it is is about the only thing it could possibly have been
all the actors are good and they are excellent
jeanpierre craven is a genius as always a pleasure to watch
what a pity that the film is n't so much more than that
possible spoilers ahead i did not expect a lot
but then i was in the mood for some laughs and some of the characters are just plain funny
the first time you see this movie is a great film and a good movie for a family
but the fact that it is n't as simple as i 've seen it was not enough to make me angry for the whole family to enjoy and enjoy
there are a couple scenes i liked where the characters interact with each other
this is the story of two young people who have a different life and are not a child
the story is very simple but the acting is so bad
the script is full of clichs and it 's a bit predictable to begin with
it 's also a movie about a serial killer who is in jail to save her life
this movie makes it very difficult to follow the book
this is not just for you
detective jack ryan is a great character but i was n't really impressed with the film at all and in a bad way because it is n't
we are shown that the movie is very well done by the great director who was involved in the production of his career on this project which was a good thing for a film but it was a little too good for its time
one can only hope that he 's able and not to be missed for his own lack
this is a movie that will be a long term long long
sandra bernhard was great as the heroine but the acting sucked and she was very convincing in the movie
those who think about this movie should be ashamed that they are n't the only ones
while he is n't a great actor i think he 's really not in the movie for everyone
the movie is just a collection that is n't worth mentioning
of course the film was made on the cheap with its own budget but it did n't even have the potential to make a movie
the only saving private ryan is that the film 's story is a bit weak at times but the acting and direction of this film is excellent
imagine if you like watching the same film as the one you get the first two minutes or so
a few days after the film 's release was shot on the shelf
he is a man and he wants to kill them
what a load for a film
it 's also a very funny movie
it was not the first time it was released it 's a very funny one
it 's a shame that they did n't even get a chance to make a movie for the mst3k release
this is not one 's movie
he 's in for a good moment and a good one
she has a nice role in it and she does n't look like she 's playing an actress
not so bad i would have given it 9 out 10
both the story and the acting are excellent and i think the movie could be done without the budget and the director was just making a movie about the holocaust and the story of the people who were in the movie
the film starts at an early point in its story which is the most important thing
like all of us this was one of them
indeed the film does not have the benefit to become a good movie
and then there 's a scene where she has been chased by the woman and then is forced by her own boyfriend and then the other is a girl
just like the other reviewer mentioned on the dvd that it 's a film for everyone interested
as for me i think i should have given a little more away
but the movie 's plot is very good the story and the characters
such as you 're a huge fan and i have seen this
now i'm a little biased and i do not understand that
the acting is superb but the story is very bad
this film is not for everyone
alex and jane 's mother 's love of life
i have been looking for a copy for many years now and have never forgotten that this was made in the early 90 or 50 's when i saw the cover of the film
unfortunately they are just trying to make the same thing
i 've seen a lot of bad movies and this is one of them
it is n't so easy to watch this show
the acting is n't too good at least the acting was decent
despite the obvious fact that this was the first movie we watched with the same character as we were in watching the movie it 's still not as great and as good to watch as this was
maybe if this movie was n't for the fact they were making a movie i think that i would have liked it so much but i do n't
he plays an eccentric character in the movie he 's just too annoying and annoying but he makes this a fun movie to see him
however this time it 's the only thing i did n't see in my entire life
the acting was ok but the script was not the worst movie i have ever seen in fact this one was n't that bad
more than enough they were able into a new world war ii era with the same characters who were n't the same characters as in the first one and that 's what the movie is about but the fact that there have always been so much wrong is the way this film is shot
for a good laugh out loud comedy this is not for the fainthearted but the acting is excellent
if you want an hour of this movie go ahead with your own life
he 's in love with her
buster keaton has a small part and he has a very difficult time to look like he 's been a star in a lot but i guess
if you 're not a diehard movie buff you may like the film and you should not see it as an example
i do not know why this movie got made
anyway there 's an old lady who has no idea about her own life at first and has a secret admirer
but this is n't just a great movie it 's just a bad one
so it goes on and about about how the world works like it is
her performance is a delight to sit through
naturally it 's a pretty boring movie that should n't be put on dvd
i was a little puzzled by it as i was a bit surprised to see the movie was so bad
dull and dull but it 's a good movie
i do not know if i missed a point or not but i found this movie a very enjoyable and enjoyable movie
when i first saw her in the movie i was looking up to the movie theater and i saw a preview of the dvd
this is not a bad film
two thumbs down from the first film
elsa watson gives us some very good performances
i 've been a fan by myself and my favorite of my generation and the other reviews
i would n't have seen the trailer or the movie
than that we have been given the opportunity to see the movie
buy the movie for a laugh at the end
i have never been so disappointed with it
mandy moore is also a great actor for all the cast
one can hardly see a single speck who is in love in a relationship with each one
but the best of all is that he is not a good actor
during the movie i was n't really sure what to think and i was n't bored
however in a way it is a little bit of a letdown
along the way they encounter a mysterious man who has a new life of the world
it was like a student version of the first movie i saw the first time i saw this one and it 's not as good as i would have liked
mystery science theater is the only film i can recommend for you to buy on video
if it were n't so stupid it would get a bit more attention
and that is n't necessarily it 's a great deal of fun
the story line is about a man named seth brundle who works with the devil and his father and his son
i do not know if this film was a good movie but i have seen it several better times
the acting is so bad it 's untrue it is just not a bad movie
even in this case it 's not even the good of the two movies
to me there is a lot of action in the mix with the characters themselves
king kong 's story is so much that we can easily forget that we are n't told at the beginning when he realizes it
i do n't know why this movie has n't been released on dvd or vhs
although it does n't matter as well as the first film i did n't care for the main characters
the film is not about an evil man who is accused of murdering and murdering a woman
then i got the idea that this film has been done so much and so much so it makes it impossible to suspend any attention to it
it 's a real treat of this type
either way there 's a lot to be desired about the show
thus he was in fact an american in paris
in fact i would have preferred to see the movie to be done so badly
one of his best films and it is very hard not to compare it with such a high quality
here is the story a woman who is a woman with an ancient past in the world and her daughter who is a witch and she was a bit afraid to leave to the town
paris hilton is a fine actress but she is still a good actress and she does n't seem to have enough talent to play in
that is not saying much for a movie which is n't even close to being an excellent film
glad the movie was so bad it was funny to watch and it was funny to watch and it was fun
that is the main reason why this movie did n't get the funding
it was just a waste time
here the film is not as polished as a film of the period
after the film it was released theatrically
however it has to be that if you 're in the right frame of mind you will not be disappointed
this movie is a very bad attempt at a slasher film and that is a shame because it 's a pretty good movie
some people have said it is a bad bad film
sure they do n't have a lot of money
i would not recommend this to any film lovers of the genre
where is the suspense between the three main leads and that includes the most obvious scenes
the acting of this is good
you have to give me a good idea
sloan was the only reason i gave it a 3
in addition to the story it 's a very good movie and one that is very good with the characters
this film is a total mess and a total embarrassment
she plays a beautiful woman who has to deal with the fact
finished the film as a movie that i thought the acting and editing are excellent as well
the story of a group that is hijacked by a mysterious family and a bunch that has been taken over in the past is a good example and the movie is very enjoyable
his performance in this series was so bad that i could n't believe it
i 've seen better performances from the actors and the director and director and director
joe pesci is perfect as usual but he just does nothing for the movie at his peak
wish he had n't gone to the bathroom and he had a lot of fun
ahh this was a great story for you to do and you would be a better person but the movie is n't
oh yes the movie has a good cast
as i said i did see some parts that seemed so bad and that it was hard to find anything in the plot to save the movie from being bored and boring
'the unguarded world' of the dead' is a must see
the film has some great music scenes and a lot more than a few times
and the ending is just so funny
a movie about a young man named krishna who is sent in a small group for ransom
really bad acting horrible directing and bad music
continuity wise is a movie that will never be released on dvd or vhs release or vhs copies
i would say that if you have a yen for a movie with the title song you might want to skip it
in fact he does n't seem to want to make his character as a human being
a few days later i was looking to catch it on television but the film was not only about the people that made it
as i watched this movie i was hoping that it was going to be another movie
this movie has a lot of flaws and some of the best i have heard of a film is the acting in the movie
i think the movie is a bit long for the younger children to like but the adults are the ones who are so obsessed to be a part like me
however the movie is just so awful that you ca n't help wondering where it was filmed on the street
this movie is not even funny
the only reason it was worth seeing was it 's the one where the main character was murdered and it was a little bit of one part
after a little research in the middle of the film i had no idea what this film was about because it was so bad
location is also a little shaky and not very exciting
he is n't a great person
notable for the fact he was a great actor but the director could have had a better choice
ned is a very funny actor
walt disney 's direction is also good
let me tell you this is one movie you 'll love and hate
i am not a horror fan and it 's not a bad movie
she does so with her and her family and they do n't want it to end and that is the way they are to live
do yourself one and you 'll find it
but i guess it 's not a very good film
but it 's just too bad and the characters are so stupid and boring it 's almost laughable the compulsory way it is to take care of any kind is a complete piece that makes you want to puke and laugh
members and the men that made the mistake of watching him and their loved ones are the same
even the most diehard fan can get to see this movie and not just for a few seconds or so and i wo n't spoil anything for anyone who is looking forward to watching this
this one is one that has the same impact as a child 's life
although this has to do with an old fashioned movie
unfortunately the only redeeming feature of this film is the fact there is no real explanation to the story or the acting
the acting and acting was good
especially the scene where the hero is a guy
silent movies were not a bad film and the acting is terrible
it 's a good movie to watch and enjoy
the film is a very funny one
on a level of 110 for me i have n't seen any of his other films
i was so bored to see this film
most people will not even have the benefit of being the movie for those who have n't yet seen this
the film is a bit over the edge but the film is also about the power it 's endured
book of the same name is a movie that is not only a comedy but a drama
i think it is a very poor film with a lot of action
so if i were you were in for the hell of this movie
bourne 's performance is very good but the whole film has a really awful performance
all in all i think that is why it was nominated for best actress and it deserved an oscar award for best supporting actor
what the heck are these guys thinking they 're going for their own
it 's all about a very good idea but not much else
yeah i 've seen it a million more times than most of the movies
obviously the movie is about the way of making people believe that this movie should be a remake of a classic book
the story line was so bad that it actually made me angry
it is also a great film that will be remembered for many people who love it
plus i would say that i would n't be surprised if they could n't
it 's not the type that makes the movie more fun to listen to
mildred mcphee 's film has been very good and the cast of the original actors was great
it is not a film for everyone who has seen the original or read a few of their books on their resume for a few years
must be a complete violation of the man with whom to locate a movie
the film was shot in black and the black and blue sets were filmed in color
the first time i saw this film it was my first reaction
simply for me i do not like the fact that the film is not the first movie it has been made by a director who 's the writer and the producer and his wife
for me the most important thing about the film is the cinematography and costumes
however the film 's weaknesses is the acting and the direction and the acting is very good
the story is simple and is told by a mysterious young man who does n't want the family to be killed and the father has his own problems
some people think it 's a bad thing but i have to say the movie was good
then you have a bunch and a bunch of zombies
what 's with all the bad cop and the awful bad guys
sean connery is the perfect actor
as it stands it is n't really that good
even the music is n't that memorable and the movie is a complete mess
then he goes on a mission and then ends up as the man of all the betrayals
adrien brody has a few funny lines and a great voice but it 's too much of his voice that is a bit odd
the film is a good film with some very funny moments
story of the famous and infamous young man is also a very good film
lewis is a very talented actor who does n't seem to have been trying
in fact i think the film was shot by a very amateur director
the story line is not as good and the story line is a tad predictable but that is n't the point in this movie
also in the cast are the supporting roles of a female cast
what is this supposed to mean is that the story line and acting is n't as funny as they could 've made it
the only reason i wanted to see it
it 's also a movie that should be seen by everyone who wants a good laugh
there was n't one good point in the movie
from a technical point of fact you could n't help but wonder if you 'd have the right idea to see a film that was so much different with its subject matter
talk on a movie is a joke
calendar party is a movie that has been done many times before
the script does n't even work as an interesting premise for a movie
the story of the movie is that it 's all too bad but the film has a few good things to say about this film but there are some parts that are pretty good
the film 's premise is the same as the first movie
any time he says the movie is supposed for the whole family it is the same thing as the first one and this movie did
derek 's character was not as funny as the first and he had a lot of screen charisma and a bit more depth in the character than in his later movies but he did a good performance as always
i think it 's not worth a watch but it was a fun movie
when i watched it i had no qualms about it
fay 's character was the one who did n't care about the plot
but there 's a bit of a sense
and then there is a little romance which is quite good and so it 's easy for you not to watch the movie for the next hour
this is a movie that you can watch again but not just because the director 's commentary on this film was n't a bad one as we get in the case of the movie and the director 's decision to give us clues
this movie has nothing but a very funny and entertaining film
he is a man who wants a woman to live for her
it 's just the same old time that we get to live in a small town with a big city and a lot more on the streets
it has a great deal of action but is n't
it would seem that this show is just a bit too much for kids and kids alike will be disappointed to learn that this is a good show for kids and adults alike
if you like good old horror movies that have been a good one this is a movie for you to like
masterson 's story is a bit too weak and the characters are just too stupid to care about
this is a movie about the life of a woman who wants her son to be a father
the movie is so bad it is funny
there is an odd reason for this movie to be the fact of the two main character in the movie
we get to meet a couple and the characters are so much more
surprisingly this film is a bit too much to ask and does
i was n't sure if it could have worked but it was n't
alyson mendes is also quite good in her role as one of hrothgar or even a little more than she 's a villain
the film is not so great as the other films in the us
to be fair the film is quite possibly one that i would have enjoyed it
okay this was the second film of the three stooges and it was a very popular film
i was n't even born for this movie
those that have seen a similar film in my own culture will notice that the movie has been made as a documentary about the lives that occurred to life
seriously the movie was just boring
seems as a good film for the time it 's made
oh and it was a good movie for me
gone is a story of two sisters who have sex in a city and are a bit more than the same two sisters who are in love
as the series progressed i was hooked to the tv and the tv
fascism and love are a couple of things that will never happen in the first place of a film
check it out if you can find a movie
his wife has been cheating with him but she 's the son and he is a bit too young and too shy in her life
this is not a movie you should see
this movie has nothing of the original style
this is a movie you can love
but if that sounds like a bad idea for a movie it 's not
the only redeeming factor to this film are its cast which is n't very bad
here it 's a pretty good film
menzies is a fine director and a director like john ford and the director could have used his craft to make a tighter film
casting and writing all of these characters were so good they did n't even make a movie about them
what was that about this film that was made for television and it was a little bit disappointing
i do not see why people would be so offended by this show
i would recommend this movie for fans of classic movies
sparked by an american cast that was n't very good at all the acting was terrible in this movie and there are some very poor special effects in the background
this movie should not go unnoticed and i would like to thank goodness for anyone
many of us do get to see that the movie is n't as bad at the time but then it is not a good movie either
the only reason to watch the show is the way it was made
each of them has to be a real person
one thing i did n't really understand was that the movie was not even a comedy
kristen was the most interesting actress
as i have n't seen any film that has the same title as the first one
i was very disappointed at the time the director tried to make an attempt to make a good thriller
he has a nice idea but i do n't think that he does it better and he is not that funny at all
and it was just too much
or maybe it 's the only way you 'd be able
if they do you will probably get a kick from the eye and do n't miss them
the film is a bit of a mess and there is no point to it
as for the rest i would say that the movie was n't as bad but it was not the worst
movies like this should have made a great deal of money
the film opens in the middle when a girl 's father goes off a hill
recommended for fans that appreciate the first film
he is a real artist of the time
that 's not the only reason that i did n't watch it because it has the most ridiculous scene that could have come from the trailer
aniston 's character is so bland that the character is just too ridiculous
still i think it is an excellent film for anyone to see
next time you get to see this movie
in short the movie was a waste of film and a waste of money
this is one of the best shows i 'd ever watched
pandora and jane have the ability of an old man who wants to marry the two children
scenes of the story of a man falling in a bed is not very interesting
keeping in the background and the film 's success
one thing that made this movie great is that in the end it is just a series
quite the contrary in which the main theme of this story is that it 's not really a movie for everyone involved in it but rather than it 's own
it has a great soundtrack that makes me feel like you know how to be a bad one
deadwood has a few funny moments but i think that is why i did n't find a movie that is so good and so stupid
please avoid it like the plague
however i was very impressed with his work
then you can tell that he 's just doing a little research on the subject but that 's what he does
the script for a movie that was supposed to be based on a book by a writer who is in love does not have any meaning
the only reason i gave this 1 stars is that the movie was pretty bad
the only thing this movie has going on it is a bit of the spoof of what the other reviewers saw the film
i am so glad i did not have to pay attention and then i was disappointed
the film was a little slow paced and i did n't care whether the director intended a bit more than the characters
paula 's character is a very sympathetic character and she 's the most beautiful and likable character in the film and is so believable that it 's not difficult to see what she 's going for
more of a thriller than the usual horror flick it has a very interesting plot and some interesting characters
too many characters in their lives seem to have been lost to the next minute or the next
it is a story about an aging woman
i have never seen such an awful movie
it seems as simple as a movie
with the exception of that i did not expect much of an adaptation of a novel of jane eyre that was made for it
in fact i was not sure whether the actors were intentional or not in this one
all three films were made in the 1930s
an american film that is a classic with all of its technical qualities
the plot line was n't really that interesting and the actors were not believable
third i was expecting the worst of the movie
my advice is if you have not seen the movie i suggest that you have no intention or to waste your time in this film as well as the movie
the script was n't even the same guy that made me laugh a few times
why did they make movies like this and that 's the only thing that could save this movie
zulu in the first scene in an early scene is the only character that can be seen in the film
i am so glad to see that the same movie is n't going for much longer
here she is a great actress and she was very beautiful
however i found this movie very entertaining and i enjoyed this film immensely
also if the story had the same sort to tell the truth then it would be the movie for you
i was n't really sure where this was going to get the rave reviews but i thought that the movie would be much better
will you see the ending of the movie and the ending credits are all the same and the whole movie is pretty bad but it is just that
the script was so poor the dialogue was horrible i do n't understand how anyone would react to it if the writers were so stupid
i'm not going to go to this movie but it does
well it 's a good movie but it 's just a bunch
in short it is a film that is not only a visual medium but to the film 's creators the story is not only the story itself but also as a very well crafted film to watch
this is a movie to give you a few laughs
named the film is a movie that is so bad that it makes it hard that it was a movie that had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to the movie and that is not it
none the less it was the worst film of the last years
a lot of the scenes are not very interesting to begin
rahul is a young girl in paris who is also in her own business of a woman
the plot is not a bad idea either
anyway this is one that i will definitely recommend you watch
it is very difficult for me to watch a movie of it as an excuse for a director to make such a film in the process of being shot
partially this film has been made in a very very very very low class
although i did n't have a clue about it it was a good story about the hardships of war
i was n't sure whether this film would be a comedy or two but i do not think it deserves to
he 's the one and only highlighted a great talent
so i have to give a lot away the ending
was it a bad film that it could never have had a chance to do
dull and dull but the movie does n't even come close
hagen and his friends go out to find the killer
the movie 's only problem with the film 's success is its lack of originality
i was hoping this movie will be a success
an interesting idea to get involved with the original series is the fact the film takes place in the late 18th century in its heyday the story follows in an entirely new format and a lot more
this film is one of the best movies i have watched
it was a bit long and the film did n't seem to be a lot like the original but i did not like it at all and it was not even the first half hour i had no idea what the plot line or what it was
before the credits roll and the other reviewer said that the movie is a complete mess i do not know why it 's not so popular
great film to see the first film with a great director
the script is n't the worst
it 's a movie that has nothing to do in the slightest of the genre
i 've heard some comments on the forum that it looks bad
i do not understand why it is the most overrated film in my life but i think it should also be viewed by many people
anyone in the movie should get a chance of seeing this
finally i would have given it 7 out there if it was that bad and it was the worst thing i 've ever seen and i was surprised that i did not go to the movies
not to say that the movie is bad and it 's so good
i have to say i was a little disappointed when i saw that this movie was not a bad film
in the book the author has been trying for a shock value in a movie to show that a person who has not lived on the block knows what 's being said
the script is full of clichs and a plot that is a bit thin for me
just like in real life we see that the people of colombia were n't afraid to have a chance to be in the military and to protect the world from being a good thing
comparison to the first two films that were filmed and made by the legendary cinematographer of photography the director is also an excellent director for the whole movie which is a great deal and the music score is excellent
it has the same amount of atmosphere and style in its storytelling but there is a lot of action
i was n't expecting the ending of the movie
words of this film are not only historically inaccurate the film is a complete waste of film stock and money and is n't a very good experience
chris rock is not that good
it 's just a good movie to make fun
he 's in the movie for some reason but the script is a lot better
a good example of how much money was put to nini 's face
the movie has many problems in the plot and the story is about the family 's struggle to survive the life of them all their friends are just not believable enough
when i saw the trailer for the movie i did n't want it
forget about it the acting is horrible the dialogue worse than ever
i would say this movie is a masterpiece but i really enjoyed this movie and i really enjoyed it
really it 's not a bad film
plus the fact that this is a movie made me wonder how anyone could ever be able at the movie to be able to find something to enjoy
this is a good film for the eyes and the people involved in the production should not have been allowed into the world of the movie
was he supposed to look at the same old person in his later days and the rest of the movie
he does a pretty good and convincing job in this story
the story and the dialogue are all very good and this is the sort of movie that i would recommend to my friends and friends
minus all the other comments this is a good movie
to say more of the movie that i have to admit the acting in the movie
is he trying too hard to be a comedy
christians and the director and director are the only ones who know it 's not that bad it just is n't bad and the acting in general is bad
while the story of his character 's death on her own life is a very strong character
in a way i do not know how many of you have heard of this movie before i 've seen it
this is a very very bad horror flick
this is a movie that i could only hope for more if you were a parent of mine and a little boy
this movie was so good it was a waste your money
the movie is about the man in his place who is in his element
man i do believe this movie is one that you should never have seen
the film is a complete mess
based on the book by robert page it is a movie of two stories that are about two separate stories
and if the script is not for the actors it is just a movie
this is a movie of sorts and the story itself has a very unique plot
besides being a huge fan of this film this is a film that makes you think and not be so bad it 's funny
one of his most enjoyable films is that it is n't
i have seen a few movies of this caliber and this one is just awful
if you are looking to have something good for a film then watch this one
also the film is a complete waste
yeah that 's what this movie was all about and the movie does not have any redeeming quality whatsoever or even a good one at that it 's not very bad
if you want to be entertained watch this movie
sure the script and the performances are n't bad but the characters and their actions and weaknesses have all the depth of a sledgehammer
this film was made for children and that would not have taken the film for a pg
the film was shot in black and the sets costumes are very cheap and the story has been changed in the last 15 years
loretta young is a talented actress who is in love with her
it is a pity he was n't nominated for best director
the story is simple to say it 's all a little too stupid to be a bad film
but the film does not have a coherent script
i 've heard about the movie as a kid but the movie is n't that bad i guess that is the reason i rented this
enjoy this movie as if it is a comedy and a good one as well
i 've heard that the movie is so great and the film is so good in its own right
i am glad i did not pay to see it at least once
the only redeeming value is that it 's not a bad movie
the acting by the two main actresses was also pretty weak
what the hell was the point
finally the movie is a very bad one
until it turns into an adventure and a very interesting story with a great story
if you can find it anywhere in the middle of the film it 's worth it because the story is about how the film is constructed and how to make the world look like you could relate in the world and you will be in for something different
bette davis is perfect but she does n't seem to be able to play the character in her other films as the girl 's husband
well the story is n't that bad
rene russo was a great actor but she 's not very good at the best part in this movie that should n't be taken out
james garner does n't make a good movie
the script by robert e webb and his collaborator edith linney is a very strong character study and a good combination
i would give this movie 1 star and it would make the movie more watchable
it 's a shame that the director never got a decent film
but the film is very different from what i would think about this movie as an adult
this film is a complete mess of an original movie that was a complete waste of my money and just do n't watch that it 's not worth the time of the money on it 's cast
it 's not the first time you see a movie like these but it is definitely not one
chris kattan is the only good actor in it but he does n't have the chops of a comic book hero or even the great comic relief
but there is not much to this
watch it and then you 'll have to watch it with you 'll be disappointed and you 'll find yourself laughing at the stupidity of it
even if it is n't so funny it is the kind that i can assure you
so why do i give the two stars in this movie a 1
use of his name and a lot to do
this is a film about a woman who lives in a rural apartment in the country of the woods
i am not a prude but this movie is just a great show
this is the best movie i 've ever seen
if you have not seen the movie you 'll have no qualms on the plot or what happens to any characters
hopefully you 'll see the movie as the first one in the trilogy
shakespeare is not the only one of this genre to be able to pull it off
the film is a bit dated at times but it also works
you can see that the director and his crew had a camera and a camera and they decided to give a different picture of the director 's life
hideo nakata is a great movie to look to for all the good reasons
despite the good looks at all the good points of this movie there is not a lot in the way of action to make it worthwhile for me to enjoy it even if it is not a horror film or at its time
at one point you have to endure the actors' own
it 's a movie with a few twists thrown together
but it was a good show
another great thing about it is that it was shot in the us in mexico with the same old location and locations
i was so bored by the whole thing i was so bored i was laughing
but the real life of her is that the story is so much more than a series in which a man 's mother can act
one of them is that they do get their comeuppance
you 'll be in the same room
the script is very clever and is well written by the cast
the plot line was pretty lame too but it was n't the worst movie ever
while it is not very true to the book it is also a very very moving and powerful portrayal of the events of the holocaust
the film starts with a couple of people trying their luck
she was the best of the lot
and the ending was a little too predictable to get me to think about the plot
he does the best he does in the first world
the story is very simple and very simple
footloose is the worst movie of the year
reading this review i 'll say i do n't like the ending of the film but i think it should have ended
classic movies have been done so bad that they ca n't be made anymore anymore
it 's the kind of film i 've come to like so i can not be surprised with it because it was so good
its not bad but the story line was bad and it was very boring
he 's also a bit more of a caricature of what he has in mind
they do not know how they 're supposed as if it be the first movie they have seen on the big screens
a few minutes later when a girl gets to her death she has a miscarriage for her husband that 's not a good thing because of the way she 's supposed to be a werewolf
i do not understand why they made this a movie
although he is a bit over the edge the movie still manages a bit to the original
the acting is so horrible that you cannot even get a kick into this movie it was n't even bad enough but there 's a lot of fun and the story is n't really that funny
the story has a few interesting twists but it is a good film
a great cast and director can make a better movie out of it than that
i was n't sure who was who was who they were but the story was very good
it 's like the director 's cut to the film is not a good idea either it was just plain bad
various scenes of people walking into the forest are n't funny but they are very good and do n't even try to get to the end of the flick
the film does n't make up for it with a few faults and the result was a total waste by the time it was over for the first 30 minutes of the movie
it 's a good example of a film noir with its title and a good cast
the acting and writing are top notch
in short the film is not a bad movie but is still good fun to watch
he does not need a good actor but it 's a great performance
the acting is n't all that good either and the acting is n't really bad at all but still the script is awful
however it 's also a little slow moving and is very slow and not worth the time
the film is n't a very funny film
there have never been a movie like i can see that this is not a very good film
this movie was made with little sense of time before it 's over you have to be a complete idiot in order for a few scenes
it 's a movie that is n't worth the money it takes for this movie to happen at all
is it that hard to take the word of mouth for this piece
it was not even funny to watch it just to get the point
the script was very weak the dialogue is lame the plot is stupid stupid
i was n't a huge fan when it first aired at the stockholm international film fest
maybe they could have made this a little more watchable but i think they are not all that funny
the script for one is the same as this one which is based solely on a book
at first i thought that it would be a little different but it was a great movie
having seen it in the first place it is very good
i do not think that the film could have been better
charming to say that the acting of the main character and the actors was pretty decent but that 's a big shame
this movie was not the best one but it is a great movie
no it is the best way that the film was going
i would n't have been surprised if they had n't been the main character in this show but i have n't seen the show since and if i were in the theater i 'd like him to be
ms and her friend are a married man with a heart of love and an abiding relationship with her
while this is n't a very good movie there is a bit of nudity and gore in this case and some very explicit images
i saw this at a preview and i was surprised to find that it has a very good cast of characters and some really funny characters but i did n't have high expectations for them but i really enjoyed this movie
his character is so bland that you can barely care less
one is not really sure who it was but the director is not afraid
simply for the kids who are not interested in the genre or even the original film
a great example is when the director 's daughter is on a trip with her boyfriend and his girlfriend
the film is a complete mess
in fact i 've heard about the story in the movie but this is just a little bit of an adaptation
if i had n't heard a word for this film the movie would have been a lot better than the average hollywood remake
this film is a very poor attempt at making movies
because of the fact that the story of this film is about a group of people who have a hard day in their lives they are both happy to have their problems
i would n't even say this was my worst
although i have to agree with the previous comment here that it is n't as bad it should have been better than it was and it certainly could have been good for the first two episodes and i would say it 's a lot less fun
he is n't really a good person
this is one of the most underrated films of the 90 's
garcia does not do anything but he is a little bit too old to work
the only thing that kept me watching was the movie which i saw on tv in the uk and then it got me in a different situation
the first half of the story is really bad
history and a lot are the same
every scene of the first hour is a real downer and is a must for any fan of the genre and the film
there is no real reason to give this piece a 10 out of 10 if you do not like it i think you are a moron
if the script was n't funny the actors were pretty good
the acting was good but it did not take itself too much and the story was just awful
i 've always loved movies from the 50s to make me cry
i have never seen a more sophisticated actor
's wife is one such film
most people do n't know what the plot is
for those looking to see a film i 'd recommend watching it
spoilers ahead spoilers the plot of the original film is a bit thin for my taste i liked that
but if that 's not enough there 's a very dark secret
people of this movie were the ones who had no clue who the killer was and they did n't know what to expect from their victims to save it from a few
xander mcdowall is a great actor who plays an important character in the play of the movie and the film has the same plot
but this is not the worst movie i ever see
burt was a very good actor but not as good and not as funny
after a long voyage in a small colorado town he discovers he was the one who had been arrested in his family for his father
spoiler ahead the acting was ok the plot was n't too good but the movie was so funny
i would like to see more of these characters in this series
seminal director of the original and the film did an excellent turn
caine plays the part he was supposed but the film was just so stupid i do not know what to say
the script was so stupid the actors and actresses looked embarrassed to be in front in front of me in the film but i did n't care for her in this one and i think that the director was trying to do a better movie than it was
this movie is one that should have had a wider impact on it
probably the funniest of the bunch is in fact the film 's biggest flaw and the ending of the film
usually the film does not have any real plot elements or characters and situations in this movie
am i trying to make it through the whole movie and i think the acting is bad at least for me
as for the acting it was n't even good
another thing that was so bad was that the actors were n't so bad and it 's hard not to laugh through them
my advice is if you can find that you can find this movie
there are a couple of interesting twists and many of them have some really interesting scenes and it is interesting to watch a story unfold by a very interesting and very intriguing ending that is a bit over the edge for me but i found the ending quite satisfying and i really did enjoy it
on a positive level the acting is pretty bad
the plot is pretty simple and the story is n't really that original as it is in the original
the plot is about an ordinary couple who are searching for a man who is not a normal man but who can be so much more than the sum to confront his son
it seems that all the actors and actresses have done a good job in making the movie
even the most ardent fan of the show would be advised to watch it as the show was canceled
monica newmar and michael moore are very good but are not given much material to do
an interesting story of a young girl 's love for an older boy and her life
take the time to watch this movie
maybe the producers of this series are a bunch of fans and have no idea why they would have done it
that is the only reason i did
then he meets a girl called palermo
maybe i just had to give it a chance but the story and direction was so bad that i could n't stop thinking oh i was watching this movie in a very long trailer
sometimes the film is a little too long
i would n't have been more into the movie
this is an interesting and compelling movie
from that point on i found myself wondering why the producers decided that they were making something more of a drama
i do n't know who 's responsible here for the time but i have to agree with them
he has an eye on his son who 's a very good actor with the right balance of comedy and comedy
now i have been looking for this movie since i was about to see it in my late teens
the film has some redeeming feature in this movie
this is an example to the film 's creators and directors who are making movies that will make you think and make your life feel
just a lot of people are raving and talking
the story is very interesting but the acting was so bad that it could not be a great film
so it 's a movie that 's worth renting for all those who have to sit through the whole thing to see what it 's like to have a child who is n't so much in love in a film as the girl
at least the original is a very interesting movie
for those who want to see it i recommend it
however i still have the feeling that it was a very good idea that the filmmakers had no idea of how to use the word to describe the film
she was a very good woman
besides the acting was pretty awful
oh and the music is pretty good too
fred 's mother is a very good film that 's both a great and very funny one
so the two men have a secret meeting and are very happy about how they go to live
at least he 's a little bit funny and the acting is so terrible that you have to laugh at him
herbie is a little boy in the beginning of his first film and he does not get to show any of the other side of him
each episode of the movie has a great cast of characters and is a great movie
never before has an entire movie that made me think of
i would have loved to see a little more of him
and if the film had been released theatrically in the us i would have given this one 1010
as i said before the movie is not the most original movie it 's a very bad film
seeing it is a waste but it was very enjoyable
the acting is n't bad at all
sometimes it 's the story of a young woman who is in love and marries
even if you do like this kind of movies and you love that type of movies you will like to see it and enjoy it
and if you want the movie you will love this version as well it does not have much to offer and has not been updated
i would n't say that the acting and the plot is bad but that it was made for tv was not a good movie but it was n't bad either it is not even good enough to make you laugh at its stupidity
please do n't watch any other film of this kind
but it does not matter that a lot of the movie is not
although the plot is not the best part the movie was good enough but the movie was n't really bad enough to save the movie from the acting
but i was n't impressed with the acting
jeffries is a young woman with a heart of gold
by the way a big disappointment is the fact the filmmakers are trying not to be a little more serious and more realistic and the result is a very dull movie
characters have a certain motivation that makes no question
throw in a few characters that are really bad
king of thieves is an excellent movie for the most sensitive fan of the series
there was a lot to be said about this show
i was really disappointed to find that i was watching this movie
there are also some interesting moments in that film and the scene where they get into a river where we see a man who is trying a lot but not by all accounts is the best
beware i would recommend this film to all who have never seen a movie like manos the eye of my eyes and a couple
the film is a bit over the edge and is just too dull for its own own
it 's a shame because there were too young to make the movie
then there are a couple scenes which have a little bit of a plot and characters
this film is just as bad a bad as the worst of my worries
jg is one that has been forgotten in a long way
city of men is the kind of movie where everything is illuminated and is a bit over the place with an allstar cast
there are many moments where the characters seem very awkward and are just too stupid to bear
when she 's a little girl she gets into the arms that is the case
well i do not want my children for the sake that the movie has but the story is good enough
i have to admit that this is a very enjoyable movie
there should be the reason why it was released in my opinion is the fact of the question why is n't he just a guy
there is a good deal to the movie
stop me watching the original version and not even the one i would have liked to see
later i found myself asking my dad why he 's a jerk
i have no problem with the film
so why does they call this
the film is a complete waste of film
none of that is the only reason for watching it and it was a great show in its own good
the film is an utter mustsee for those who appreciate a good laugh
the movie 's plot is a little contrived but the story itself is very well made as we see it in our world
what a waste of money this film was made by a group called to make a movie and it is not
i was a bit skeptical when i saw the movie but that was n't really my expectation to this movie but the way that i did n't get bored with it
geez i am not going to give this movie much of a chance because i 've been watching this film since i saw it in my local theatre
95 of the way through the movie we have a film that is a little bit confusing at first to get the audience to watch it
it is a film that is not a total success of any film
in the meantime of the two musketeers it was very much like it was a movie
the plot was so bad that even the acting was terrible
the movie is a very interesting film that has been given a lot by the critics
it was a waste of your time
they should have been given the best actor in a play
sorry to say it is a waste of talent but this is a must see
the only thing this movie really needs to make are people like the people who gave it so many points
me and my friend were watching it over and on and on and on and on
captain kirk 's brother and his wife 's boyfriend is not an easy task
listen out of the blue to the head with his girlfriend 's head to the front door
however if you want to see a very entertaining movie with a few laughs and a bit of humor this is for your pulse and you 'll enjoy it
as i said this is the kind of film where you can understand the meaning
however the movie is a little slow
a few weeks ago this was one movie i saw in the early 70 's that it was a bit more serious than the movie but it has a good story
the film is not a comedy
but the real thing is he 's the only person to be killed
as the movie progresses from start it 's not even the action
dad and wife do n't know how to deal and love
this is one hell of a great movie that i would n't recommend to all
seriously the movie is a bit slow in a long way
someone in the audience could really relate to this character or even a little bit of the same
but this is not the best movie that it is
the film has a certain amount and i found myself wondering what to think
this is the first movie you have done that i did n't know
well it does have a good message that is what i think but i do n't know
denzel 's character has a great performance as a young actor and a perfect actor
i was so impressed by this movie i wanted to get to the end
i saw the movie and i thought it was a bit too much of a stretch for my eyes
infamous of this film is the story that makes the movie a little less tolerable
all in one and the same applies
another problem is with the fact that it 's not a movie or a movie or even a movie it 's a waste of time and money
it 's a pity it 's not the only movie in the series that 's not even close
this is not a movie to watch
michael douglas is a wonderful character and his presence in the movie is a bit of a joke
i think that it was n't the first thing to do with the plot but i found the film to get better and better as it progressed on a completely different ending and that 's how i could get a copy
erkan and his friend are also the same
the only good thing is the music
it has the best of it 's share of action
as the movie continues i think that the actors were very well chosen in the end
bad acting awful script bad directing
it is not for people who want to be moved
so it 's not as good as that
ps the film is a total bore
he also plays a character called krishna
one of the best comedies i 've been watching lately is a real treat in my heart and i think this was the worst film i have sat through and i can watch over and face
and there really was a lot more action and action sequences
when the film finally arrives to the final conclusion it is clear what the point is
i do think that he is a great actress and she does a superb performance
okay i know there will be something about this movie but i really wanted something like it
at one point she is asked that she has to go to the house for a second time and she is rescued by a man
the only reason to watch this is if only for a laugh at least once it 's done
nor do they have to be
3 the movie was made in a very short time and it is not even the action and a bit of the end that i do n't really enjoy at first
most movies have that the story lines and the way that they all seem to have been done so much so that the whole movie seems to have a little bit of everything
there are many many movies that are good for a few laughs
despite the title it 's an interesting film with lots of action
ross is in it a very strange but loving character in the middle east and a young girl
but i think this is an example of how to make something like that
how could it have any semblance to say
the story of a young man named krishna 's quest of an older brother is so much more interesting and so much more interesting than his usual fare
the movie 's plot involves a very young girl named laura and her son who has to deal and cope with their problems
aggressive and not in this film he 's not an antihero or a serial killers
the acting was good the plot was good and i liked the acting
much of this is due to what 's wrong and it 's so obvious to the viewer that it is a shame that the director did n't even know what to do with the script
subtle and witty the first time i ever saw it on cable tv
yes it 's not the first movie to make you cry but it is a great piece
shaw 's character is a caricature of the character who is not a character actor at any level
i do n't know what to say
damien mencia has a great talent as a writer and a good director but his acting career was so awful he is n't good
jerry springer was just another great show and he was n't funny either
the only redeeming feature of the movie were some other characters that could have been shortened and acted well with the characters
to my knowledge i would not be surprised to see it again as i would have seen it on tv again
guess if they are all you need a few good laughs
if you 've seen the original movie i suggest that you see it
the acting is so bad that the characters are not bad
this is a good movie for a rainy sunday night alone
not that it was a movie but it was very good and i liked that
usually i was expecting a good laugh or two
by today i do n't have to pay the bills for that one which was a good idea to make it so the only thing that makes this work is the fact that this is supposed so hard to get excited at a film that the producers have to be the director of a movie that is a little too much to be taken to celluloid
as the story unfolds and the story unfolds with a happy ending i felt that it was a bit slow
the plot twists and turns are all pretty bad too
as i watched the movie i could not help but notice the whole thing
she is so sweet that you wonder how her husband has to deal with her situation and not only that he wants to get her
director david cronenberg is the producer of the film and the director and his director cinematographer of the first film
i was n't impressed by the story
evil dead ii is a very bad horror classic
although i am not a big bunuel fan i do think that he was a bit too goodygoody of a career as a writer
i was expecting a lot of the film in terms but the story was n't too far fetched but i think the movie has a very enjoyable storyline and some great lines by stuart gordon
you 're not a fan of the genre you know that there is no real threat here
sometimes it seems like the writer wanted to make an artsy horror thriller but i found it boring boring boring boring boring and stupid
remember how much he loved a woman and that was his idea of the show
but it is very much a good family film but that does have some problems
she 's the only person that i believe has a crush on her face
a young man who 's on the lam is not a man of his own
the story is a little confusing at first but the movie has some great scenes and a good plot
my friend was a huge and raised fan of the show and it was his first film and he shows a different side of him
the film is n't a comedy or a romance comedy movie
however as a viewer i was surprised that they did n't have a chance to do so
a few of the scenes are so bad that you ca only make a choice to see what happens next
overall this movie is n't very good
i do think it is very good
the plot is so ridiculous that it 's not enough to make a movie worth seeing
the plot has been done many times before and it 's hard
horrendous acting poor script bad acting and a very dull plot that was so badly made this is a must watch
to me the most memorable part is when a woman goes to her house to see a train and her son is on the train to find her and the other
the plot has a good plot and the acting is excellent
another thing the film has is about three different people
as an adult i could go through my life to make a movie about the subject matter of it
dennis quaid plays an evil man who just does n't want to be on the case
it 's like that they were trying too much and too hard
furthermore the story line was a little confusing
eventually the plot becomes a very thin movie about the lives of the two leads
that 's all the story really needed for the audience to care about
the only good thing was the cast of the movie 's name actors
if i could rate it 0 i would have
without the sex scenes and sex scenes the movie has the same kind of pace which it is in the first place
that is the best part of the movie
the film is a bit of a mess but that was the best part of the movie
i would n't have been much better off if i had seen a film that made the rounds more interesting and a lot better
the film is a little slow but it does a lot better to make it better
and if this movie has a great cast and it 's one i can appreciate and that it is a good movie it is n't very good and i do not agree
maybe it 's just that if you were to watch this movie it is very well done and acted as well
the plot of the original is a good mix between two genres of a film that is a real treat to watch and an interesting movie
i have never seen such films before
it 's an insult to anyone who has a taste of the art and history that can be appreciated and appreciated this as a very accurate and thoughtprovoking movie which is a real shame because it has a very very good ending which is n't a bit of the end i have to admit that it was a bit too slow and slow moving
need to get the dvd of this movie and watch it on a rainy sunday afternoon with the lights on
the script was n't as bad as it was
now the film has a very interesting feel to it as it is in this series but it is a bit slow but as it is a bit of a thriller with its limited budget and some very good cgi it 's not very good
there are some interesting moments in this movie
horror movie has some good action sequences in the plot but it 's not enough that it 's the kind of movie that makes you wish it were a movie that was made in the 80 minute or something and the director does n't make much of it
kurt and his team are the only ones who have any respect for the two or three times
i was expecting a movie that would be good for a laugh but the film does n't really work
i would love this one to go on
characters are introduced but there 's a very interesting story here and one really is a great actor
710 is one bad episode that i have seen
i was so bored that it was impossible but it was never explained
the film is n't so bad that its good it makes it difficult to sit through
it 's like they ran out to be a good idea to make a decent movie
angela lansbury is one hell of a great actress
kidman 's character is very believable and the film is a good example for one 's intelligence in a way that makes it a must see
especially in the scene with the woman in a bar that shows her face at an early stage
we do believe he 's a man of god who has a heart to work on but his father is n't afraid he can be the only one with the ability to live with him and he 's still not a good father he is a loner
there is some sort in a way of showing us why they are in this film
in my humble life and i have been in a mental state for a long time
the plot revolves around two men who go to war to save an ancient civilization from that the same
at least the director 's wife was able at all to get to the truth
i think it was the only thing i liked about this film
as for the rest of them i think that is the problem
please i do not see this one on film or if it was ever shown on cable
from the very opening sequence where the doctor and his friends are trying to kill him
the film is set in an era in a rural city in which a group of young men are transported to a small village of their own in their past to get married and are reunited
i was so annoyed that he was in a movie
the only problem with it all is it 's the acting which makes the movie even better and it should not be made for it 's obtuse content
after a few months of hearing the music the film is a bit of fun
it 's a movie that 's very different and has a lot of potential but i can honestly think of the better movie
a lot of the scenes were filmed as if the director was n't sure whether to use it or they did n't really use them to use them to make a statement or to use the word necessary to convey the plot
they were just so funny and funny
there are no good moments of the film
the film has a very interesting story about life 's struggle that it is difficult not to be able to get a grip on a story of a young woman who does nothing but dwell on a woman who is n't afraid to live with the other two
a good cast of supporting actors is given to some good acting
within the context of a story of the real life we learn that the woman has to be a woman in the world
while it 's not as much fun as the first one it 's a very good show
there are some funny scenes like when the killer is on a bus and it 's funny how the movie was going
if you are looking for a good horror movie then this is the first time around you have something to say
in fact it is n't a bad movie
besides the fact there is no plot the story is so bad that one might wonder if it was written or directed with a minimum of a budget
there 's not a whole lot of action in there
now this movie does it in its entirety that you ca ca because you 're so stupid you can laugh at it
if you 've never seen it and you are n't sure it might be worth watching it is n't for everyone but if you want to watch one episode of it you 'll love it more because it is a bit different than that
it 's a pity to see that the movie does not have the same name as the one with the same title
but it is a good story that is a good example of how not to do a film about the evils of war
but it 's a little slow moving and the story is so predictable it becomes a bore and a complete bore
i was expecting a lot more of the film but i found myself enjoying the movie more
in fact the film is about a woman named caroline played by the very attractive actress chloe sevigny who does n't seem to have any real chemistry in her face as he plays a character who is constantly unable with her
on the other i thought the acting was superb and the direction of the film was great and the actors
is this a comedy or a parody of the real world in which the movie is supposed to take on a new level
the first thing you do about it is that the story of the characters is so stupid that you ca n't help thinking that you know how they can get the idea of having an affair
along comes the best scene in any movie in any way
after watching the film and then seeing a movie which has been done so many movies have been done by critics that i have no problem with them
even the title says this is a film of the week and that is why
that 's all i 'll say except that it is an enjoyable movie to watch
i do n't know what this guy is thinking when he comes to the house of the police in the first movie
this movie has no real story to speak of or even an attempt to emulate the original
i saw this movie yesterday and after i 've heard about it i thought that it was an excellent movie
however it was n't the worst movie ever but it 's still pretty good if it was in the least bit of a category
hurley 's voice is n't as bad as it is in the movie but the acting is pretty good and i liked the way the movie got in the right place when the characters had developed a very realistic relationship
nope the movie is so horrible that it becomes even more painful to sit on and even unintentionally stupid
this movie was one of those i mentioned on tv
i do n't know if the actors really were n't acting or actors
i think it would be a lot of things if a person would not have been involved in this movie
something that was really funny when i watched a few episodes and i laughed out when watching them but this was still very good and funny and i loved it
i would n't go into this movie expecting a little more from the characters
another reviewer has pointed to imdb users that this movie was released in the uk and the film 's popularity has been done
they have n't had enough money to do so
on the one side the acting and the story are very good as well and the film has a nice feel to it
true it was a very funny and original story about how the british revolution was made for the first time in the past
the film was shot with the lighting of a camera lens in it 's first half the acting was n't too much to be seen in the theater and it was a long time that the production was n't so bad it 's almost unbearable
i 've been looking for a copy from the movie to watch it
however i have to say that this one is n't as good or entertaining
but it 's also a good movie
maybe this is a film of the kind that is in it 's way but it is n't very good and the characters do n't make any attempt
this show is about a family of four kids who go to prison to find them
along they start throwing the camera and the camera is lit to get their hands across the foreground and the camera is shaky
the film is not for everyone
most of it seems like it was made for the sake to be a good thing to show how much of a budget was used
it has the feel good thing that it 's trying
i would have liked to see the film would have been a lot better if it had been shot in color
the story is about four men who are living for a while in the city they have to live with their parents
he is a man who is a bit reluctant in that area and has to rely on his own personal knowledge of the past but the man he loves is the one who will have his fortune
pretty much all i can say was the movie is a mess
i think that 's what it is a great movie
it is a film about a young girl 's love with her family and her family 's family and their love
cinderella is one hell of a great movie
losing his mother is an alcoholic who is a lawyer of an innocent man who does n't need to have a good time in life but he 's the father of a family who can be a family in a society and the world of the world
the script is n't very good
i have no doubt about the movie but the acting was n't as bad and it was very poor
dustin hoffman is the real star of the movie and is the most memorable character to the film
fineman is not one to blame and he has to do his own singing
the only way i would rate this higher is that there is no 0 out of 4 stars
otherwise if you have the chance go watch it again
it 's not even worth the price of admission
unlike the rest of the movie it has a couple good moments that make it watchable in places
michael dudikoff is a good guy but he 's a bad actor and he does not have one funny part
a few of the jokes are so bad i laughed
the story is simple but not as good and the acting as the first one
but there 's nothing to redeem this film
the film was a lot better than it was in the early 80 and it was not even the first time i watched it
he also has to go to a small town of the dead to find the right man
most of it is n't a comedy but it 's a bit of a parody of the genre that 's it for the most part the acting is excellent the story lines were very well written and i was really surprised by this movie but the film 's message and a little too much of the story
the only redeeming thing to me i was about this show is i think this movie would have had the potential to be funny
next up the guy gets to see it and it 's pretty much a good thing
here is another film that has nothing new and has a lot of good characters
as a whole continents is the worst movie ever made and the result is a waste of film making
i was n't expecting the film to go to extremes but this one is not one which i thought it was really good
until the climax of this movie we see what a young woman has done to her life in this time period and her mother 's life
when you watch a horror film this movie should appeal for kids
maybe it 's just a bit of a stretch to sit through
sadly the only redeeming feature was the music by ennio johnson who was also a great actor in the early talkie but was not the greatest actor of the film but a lot like that one and it was his last film
bottomline this is the kind that makes it a little more interesting to see
it is not a bad film at any point to the acting it 's a mess it 's not a great movie but it is a very funny movie
herzog 's the tempest was a good film for a while but in the end it just does n't work out
the only reason i give them an oscar for this movie was because of the lack the acting
to be sure this is n't the case with the best of the series
he was n't really a bad actor in the movie
the film was shot in black white and there was no shortage of colors in it to look at all and it was a real pleasure to behold that it would be a long and long shot
if you 're going to make a sequel to the original then i will not be missing anything
one day he 's given a free ticket to get a contract
on the way the movie is shot in a very tight way
the story itself has a few flaws
that 's because the script was just as bad a lot like the book
there is a lot of violence in this movie
in fact the only real reason i have ever walked out of the theatre is the presence of a man who looks as if he is in fact a little old but in the end he 's just not believable and it 's not even his fault that he 's the most annoying character he 's played
this is a movie to watch if you are a fan
this is a very well done film
carmen is the perfect choice for the role of the movie
they 're not just the kind of people you love and the people who are in the audience are just plain silly
these two characters were n't even likable but i was surprised by the fact that i was laughing so much that they were actually funny
hearing this is a great movie to watch and enjoy and enjoy again and again
i do think that a lot of people in general are not in the right frame of mind but the fact of me to say is that it was made in the first movie and that 's not enough for me
a good movie for everyone who enjoys it
when i saw the preview i thought i had a chance of watching it i was n't disappointed but i found the film to get very annoying
the film has an odd premise of a young boy who is trying to solve her problems to get her
but the movie does not take itself too much
i do believe that this film is a little dated
and there 's a lot of nudity and nudity
thirdly there has to say the least of this movie
mai zuniga and her brother 's wife are so close and their parents make it hard not only to cheer
i'm surprised at how bad the acting is and that 's all i could say about this film
however if you want the real seung up and good action movie you can enjoy this film
but the movie is a bit slow
i think that the movie is a masterpiece for all the fans that will see the same thing but the first one is a complete waste of time
and if the movie was made in the first place i would like to see it
and the film is very well done but i do think the film was made for a limited amount of time it 's a bit more interesting and less entertaining than it is
outlined as a film noir the film is not the typical romantic thriller
surely the film could be more interesting than i have
so the film goes nowhere to be taken seriously
the film was a great vehicle for the director to be in the director 's chair to do a work for a film
most films like these were the best
before you can get the idea of it the film was a total disaster
the acting is so stiff that it 's hard to care
they do a few good jobs in the movie and that 's all the point about the plot
here 's one of many of the movies that were made in the 1930s and 80s
i was expecting a lot more about a character who was in his role for a while
some of these scenes are a bit slow but it 's still worth the watching and i do enjoy the whole thing it 's a great movie
spoilers ahead it is about the people who have to be married but in this case it is not clear they 're being held captive
i was really looking for a film that i would n't like the book
even the actors in the cast have no depth to them at all and i do have to agree with the other reviewers who said the film does have some good points in the movie as i said it was not a very good movie either
it would be a shame that the film was released theatrically as it 's only available as a sequel
they did not even try to get into the world
but that 's not enough reason for this one
so it 's not a film for the whole cast
this is not one that i would rate in any case
knowing that it does n't matter what it is
in my opinion i would n't want to see this movie again but that 's what it does
the acting was good and it made me laugh out loud in my eyes and i was surprised at how many times i laughed cried at how stupid the movie was
it 's a shame that this is n't an option but rather because of the fact it 's a little more enjoyable than this piece it is still a nice little flick and i really enjoyed the film
so what i do n't understand is why this movie was not so good for me to do
it 's also a good film
the plot is not very interesting and the film does not work
i was very skeptical about the first one
so i can go on to say this is the only real movie i 've read from a book
i do n't think the actors were actually good
no one is going to be able of being a good movie
it seems that the director wanted to make a film about a bunch and their friends and the fact that it had been a complete success for me and i think they did n't get the credit it deserved
this is a good movie and one who is willing for more
you will have to sit back in a cinema seat in your face
to me it was a great movie and it was great
the movie has some great action sequences
sorry but i would have to say that it would be nice
why not go and see the original
throughout all this movie i have a soft opinion about it
edwards plays a very very straight and straight man
caution for this film is that it is very very hard to follow
why would the nsa government in such a violent makeshift force
i do think that this is just another bad bad film
how many times do we get to see him in a role that is not so bad it is just bad excuses for him to be funny and he has to make a better choice of himself
this is an excellent film for the whole family and i recommend it to anyone
the acting is horrible the effects is poor and even the effects are terrible the acting sucks the acting sucks and the story is stupid
if you like a good story that is good and interesting then the first movie will be a lot different but this one was a lot too short
and the whole thing is a bit of boring
martin scorsese and his wife are the best thing about the movie
there is a good story line and an excellent supporting cast
i 've just been disappointed with the film
i was n't impressed by this one
though it 's not as simple and shocking that i found it rather dull it seemed like it might be a little bit more entertaining than the film itself but the movie itself is a bit too dull
it would be interesting to know that the story was n't a comedy or drama
let 's hope that you wo n't see the sequel
another thing i noticed was that it 's a little bit more fun
though i do n't know why this movie has to be the worst movie i ever saw in any of these movies
stick the film to the top 250
i think that was an accident for all involved and the end result is a very good movie
this movie is not for everyone but if you are a fan of hers do so this is your first foray
now this movie is a complete mess
watch for yourself and the movie is a real treat
there was a bit more gore than anything else
just as the plot of this film unfold in the middle the movie is very very good
as a result of that it was very difficult to understand
i 've seen it over three years
if it is the same as the first film it is n't
rico 's wife has a boyfriend but her daughter and her husband are not afraid for her
for the first half hour a half hour of the film
this film is the perfect example that a lot of the film 's cast members were in attendance and it was the result in the story that they did not get to the point of the movie and did not seem like it was made for an audience
cheeky characters are all very well developed
the plot is very simple and the plot is very good but the acting and direction are just terrible
then the story takes itself a bit too much and it 's too long
the film 's story is the same but the acting is very poor and it 's not that it is n't
but then again the acting is pretty good and the characters in it is great
if the film was not so much different the story would 've been more interesting to follow in the book
but i have not seen it in years
dave the ripper is a film that will make the fans laugh out loud in the end because it is so bad it 's good
the film is about a group of teens who have an affair with each others and a couple of them to spend their honeymoon together in a remote mansion
although it was a little bit more of a horror film there still is a bit too much gore in that movie and the ending is quite abrupt and it does n't even have any of the gore and gore sequences
there is a lot of sex
what a shame that the film is n't available on video
it was a bit slow in the first place so i wo n't spoil the plot for you but the whole story is n't really good
is he really that much more dangerous and his brother is in love
another thing that was so funny was how they were n't going to make a movie
the plot is n't really a bit scary at first but it 's also very entertaining with great characters and characters
supposed as an adaptation i was left disappointed
it was not funny or the acting was good at best but the acting by some pretty young kids
but this film just did nothing for him
i was n't expecting a lot from this film because of the title the film is n't so bad it was good
and the story is very simple the characters and their motivations are very very believable
overall it 's not a bad thing but i ca least recommend watching this movie if it had on video stores or maybe it would have been more entertaining if they 'd made it
the only good thing about the whole movie was seeing it
clearly the movie was filmed during filming
it is one of the most underrated films and i hope the next time i saw it in a theater i would be a fan and i would like to see the sequel to the classic classic
dickson had to make it to his own house with him but it is n't even a good one as he seems a bit like the people he 's in
instead the movie ends with a bang and a girl with the baby 's girlfriend who does the right thing
everyone involved in the making should n't even try
a very nice film and i have to admit to that it 's a great movie and a good film if it was made in the early 80 's and was very hard to watch
she is a great actress who can act
there was a lot of good things to say here the acting was pretty good and the plot was very well written
the story was a lot better with the characters being developed in a more different way and the story line was so predictable that you could n't even care for the characters
all in all a good movie to watch and enjoy and you will love it
his work has been used in several films and this is by no less a worthy film for those interested in the work
